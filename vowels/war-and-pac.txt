BOOK ON: 1805
CHAPTR I
“Wll, Princ, so Gnoa and Lucca ar now just family stats of th
Buonaparts. But I warn you, if you don’t tll m that this mans war,
if you still try to dfnd th infamis and horrors prptratd by that
Antichrist—I rally bliv h is Antichrist—I will hav nothing
mor to do with you and you ar no longr my frind, no longr my
‘faithful slav,’ as you call yourslf! But how do you do? I s I
hav frightnd you—sit down and tll m all th nws.”
It was in July, 1805, and th spakr was th wll-known Anna Pávlovna
Schrr, maid of honor and favorit of th mprss Márya Fëdorovna.
With ths words sh grtd Princ Vasíli Kurágin, a man of high
rank and importanc, who was th first to arriv at hr rcption. Anna
Pávlovna had had a cough for som days. Sh was, as sh said, suffring
from la gripp; gripp bing thn a nw word in St. Ptrsburg, usd
only by th lit.
All hr invitations without xcption, writtn in Frnch, and dlivrd
by a scarlt-livrid footman that morning, ran as follows:
“If you hav nothing bttr to do, Count (or Princ), and if th
prospct of spnding an vning with a poor invalid is not too trribl,
I shall b vry charmd to s you tonight btwn 7 and 10—Anntt
Schrr.”
“Havns! what a virulnt attack!” rplid th princ, not in th
last disconcrtd by this rcption. H had just ntrd, waring an
mbroidrd court uniform, kn brchs, and shos, and had stars on
his brast and a srn xprssion on his flat fac. H spok in that
rfind Frnch in which our grandfathrs not only spok but thought, and
with th gntl, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importanc
who had grown old in socity and at court. H wnt up to Anna Pávlovna,
kissd hr hand, prsnting to hr his bald, scntd, and shining had,
and complacntly satd himslf on th sofa.
“First of all, dar frind, tll m how you ar. St your frind’s
mind at rst,” said h without altring his ton, bnath th
politnss and affctd sympathy of which indiffrnc and vn irony
could b discrnd.
“Can on b wll whil suffring morally? Can on b calm in tims
lik ths if on has any fling?” said Anna Pávlovna. “You ar
staying th whol vning, I hop?”
“And th ft at th nglish ambassador’s? Today is Wdnsday. I
must put in an apparanc thr,” said th princ. “My daughtr is
coming for m to tak m thr.”
“I thought today’s ft had bn cancld. I confss all ths
fstivitis and firworks ar bcoming warisom.”
“If thy had known that you wishd it, th ntrtainmnt would hav
bn put off,” said th princ, who, lik a wound-up clock, by forc
of habit said things h did not vn wish to b blivd.
“Don’t tas! Wll, and what has bn dcidd about Novosíltsv’s
dispatch? You know vrything.”
“What can on say about it?” rplid th princ in a cold, listlss
ton. “What has bn dcidd? Thy hav dcidd that Buonapart has
burnt his boats, and I bliv that w ar rady to burn ours.”
Princ Vasíli always spok languidly, lik an actor rpating a stal
part. Anna Pávlovna Schrr on th contrary, dspit hr forty yars,
ovrflowd with animation and impulsivnss. To b an nthusiast had
bcom hr social vocation and, somtims vn whn sh did not
fl lik it, sh bcam nthusiastic in ordr not to disappoint th
xpctations of thos who knw hr. Th subdud smil which, though it
did not suit hr fadd faturs, always playd round hr lips xprssd,
as in a spoild child, a continual consciousnss of hr charming dfct,
which sh nithr wishd, nor could, nor considrd it ncssary, to
corrct.
In th midst of a convrsation on political mattrs Anna Pávlovna burst
out:
“Oh, don’t spak to m of Austria. Prhaps I don’t undrstand
things, but Austria nvr has wishd, and dos not wish, for war. Sh
is btraying us! Russia alon must sav urop. Our gracious sovrign
rcognizs his high vocation and will b tru to it. That is th on
thing I hav faith in! Our good and wondrful sovrign has to prform
th noblst rol on arth, and h is so virtuous and nobl that God will
not forsak him. H will fulfill his vocation and crush th hydra of
rvolution, which has bcom mor trribl than vr in th prson of
this murdrr and villain! W alon must avng th blood of th just
on.... Whom, I ask you, can w rly on?... ngland with hr commrcial
spirit will not and cannot undrstand th mpror Alxandr’s
loftinss of soul. Sh has rfusd to vacuat Malta. Sh wantd to
find, and still sks, som scrt motiv in our actions. What answr
did Novosíltsv gt? Non. Th nglish hav not undrstood and cannot
undrstand th slf-abngation of our mpror who wants nothing for
himslf, but only dsirs th good of mankind. And what hav thy
promisd? Nothing! And what littl thy hav promisd thy will not
prform! Prussia has always dclard that Buonapart is invincibl, and
that all urop is powrlss bfor him.... And I don’t bliv a
word that Hardnburg says, or Haugwitz ithr. This famous Prussian
nutrality is just a trap. I hav faith only in God and th lofty
dstiny of our adord monarch. H will sav urop!”
Sh suddnly pausd, smiling at hr own imptuosity.
“I think,” said th princ with a smil, “that if you had bn
snt instad of our dar Wintzingrod you would hav capturd th King
of Prussia’s consnt by assault. You ar so loqunt. Will you giv m
a cup of ta?”
“In a momnt. À propos,” sh addd, bcoming calm again, “I am
xpcting two vry intrsting mn tonight, l Vicomt d Mortmart, who
is connctd with th Montmorncys through th Rohans, on of th bst
Frnch familis. H is on of th gnuin migrs, th good ons. And
also th Abb Morio. Do you know that profound thinkr? H has bn
rcivd by th mpror. Had you hard?”
“I shall b dlightd to mt thm,” said th princ. “But
tll m,” h addd with studid carlssnss as if it had only just
occurrd to him, though th qustion h was about to ask was th chif
motiv of his visit, “is it tru that th Dowagr mprss wants
Baron Funk to b appointd first scrtary at Vinna? Th baron by all
accounts is a poor cratur.”
Princ Vasíli wishd to obtain this post for his son, but othrs wr
trying through th Dowagr mprss Márya Fëdorovna to scur it for
th baron.
Anna Pávlovna almost closd hr ys to indicat that nithr sh nor
anyon ls had a right to criticiz what th mprss dsird or was
plasd with.
“Baron Funk has bn rcommndd to th Dowagr mprss by hr
sistr,” was all sh said, in a dry and mournful ton.
As sh namd th mprss, Anna Pávlovna’s fac suddnly assumd an
xprssion of profound and sincr dvotion and rspct mingld with
sadnss, and this occurrd vry tim sh mntiond hr illustrious
patronss. Sh addd that Hr Majsty had dignd to show Baron Funk
baucoup d’stim, and again hr fac cloudd ovr with sadnss.
Th princ was silnt and lookd indiffrnt. But, with th womanly and
courtirlik quicknss and tact habitual to hr, Anna Pávlovna
wishd both to rbuk him (for daring to spak as h had don of a man
rcommndd to th mprss) and at th sam tim to consol him, so sh
said:
“Now about your family. Do you know that sinc your daughtr cam
out vryon has bn nrapturd by hr? Thy say sh is amazingly
bautiful.”
Th princ bowd to signify his rspct and gratitud.
“I oftn think,” sh continud aftr a short paus, drawing narr
to th princ and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political
and social topics wr ndd and th tim had com for intimat
convrsation—“I oftn think how unfairly somtims th joys of lif
ar distributd. Why has fat givn you two such splndid childrn?
I don’t spak of Anatol, your youngst. I don’t lik him,” sh
addd in a ton admitting of no rjoindr and raising hr ybrows.
“Two such charming childrn. And rally you apprciat thm lss than
anyon, and so you don’t dsrv to hav thm.”
And sh smild hr cstatic smil.
“I can’t hlp it,” said th princ. “Lavatr would hav said I
lack th bump of patrnity.”
“Don’t jok; I man to hav a srious talk with you. Do you know
I am dissatisfid with your youngr son? Btwn ourslvs” (and hr
fac assumd its mlancholy xprssion), “h was mntiond at Hr
Majsty’s and you wr pitid....”
Th princ answrd nothing, but sh lookd at him significantly,
awaiting a rply. H frownd.
“What would you hav m do?” h said at last. “You know I did all
a fathr could for thir ducation, and thy hav both turnd out fools.
Hippolyt is at last a quit fool, but Anatol is an activ on. That
is th only diffrnc btwn thm.” H said this smiling in a way
mor natural and animatd than usual, so that th wrinkls round
his mouth vry clarly rvald somthing unxpctdly coars and
unplasant.
“And why ar childrn born to such mn as you? If you wr not a
fathr thr would b nothing I could rproach you with,” said Anna
Pávlovna, looking up pnsivly.
“I am your faithful slav and to you alon I can confss that my
childrn ar th ban of my lif. It is th cross I hav to bar. That
is how I xplain it to myslf. It can’t b hlpd!”
H said no mor, but xprssd his rsignation to crul fat by a
gstur. Anna Pávlovna mditatd.
“Hav you nvr thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatol?” sh
askd. “Thy say old maids hav a mania for matchmaking, and though I
don’t fl that waknss in myslf as yt, I know a littl prson who
is vry unhappy with hr fathr. Sh is a rlation of yours, Princss
Mary Bolkónskaya.”
Princ Vasíli did not rply, though, with th quicknss of mmory and
prcption bfitting a man of th world, h indicatd by a movmnt of
th had that h was considring this information.
“Do you know,” h said at last, vidntly unabl to chck th sad
currnt of his thoughts, “that Anatol is costing m forty thousand
rubls a yar? And,” h wnt on aftr a paus, “what will it b in
fiv yars, if h gos on lik this?” Prsntly h addd: “That’s
what w fathrs hav to put up with.... Is this princss of yours
rich?”
“Hr fathr is vry rich and stingy. H livs in th country. H is
th wll-known Princ Bolkónski who had to rtir from th army undr
th lat mpror, and was nicknamd ‘th King of Prussia.’ H is
vry clvr but ccntric, and a bor. Th poor girl is vry unhappy.
Sh has a brothr; I think you know him, h marrid Lis Minn latly.
H is an aid-d-camp of Kutúzov’s and will b hr tonight.”
“Listn, dar Anntt,” said th princ, suddnly taking Anna
Pávlovna’s hand and for som rason drawing it downwards. “Arrang
that affair for m and I shall always b your most dvotd slav-slaf
with an f, as a villag ldr of min writs in his rports. Sh is rich
and of good family and that’s all I want.”
And with th familiarity and asy grac pculiar to him, h raisd th
maid of honor’s hand to his lips, kissd it, and swung it to and fro
as h lay back in his armchair, looking in anothr dirction.
“Attndz,” said Anna Pávlovna, rflcting, “I’ll spak to
Lis, young Bolkónski’s wif, this vry vning, and prhaps th
thing can b arrangd. It shall b on your family’s bhalf that I’ll
start my apprnticship as old maid.”
CHAPTR II
Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room was gradually filling. Th highst
Ptrsburg socity was assmbld thr: popl diffring widly in ag
and charactr but alik in th social circl to which thy blongd.
Princ Vasíli’s daughtr, th bautiful Hlèn, cam to tak hr
fathr to th ambassador’s ntrtainmnt; sh wor a ball drss and
hr badg as maid of honor. Th youthful littl Princss Bolkónskaya,
known as la fmm la plus sduisant d Ptrsbourg, * was also thr.
Sh had bn marrid during th prvious wintr, and bing prgnant did
not go to any larg gathrings, but only to small rcptions. Princ
Vasíli’s son, Hippolyt, had com with Mortmart, whom h introducd.
Th Abb Morio and many othrs had also com.
     * Th most fascinating woman in Ptrsburg.
To ach nw arrival Anna Pávlovna said, “You hav not yt sn my
aunt,” or “You do not know my aunt?” and vry gravly conductd
him or hr to a littl old lady, waring larg bows of ribbon in hr
cap, who had com sailing in from anothr room as soon as th gusts
bgan to arriv; and slowly turning hr ys from th visitor to hr
aunt, Anna Pávlovna mntiond ach on’s nam and thn lft thm.
ach visitor prformd th crmony of grting this old aunt whom not
on of thm knw, not on of thm wantd to know, and not on of thm
card about; Anna Pávlovna obsrvd ths grtings with mournful and
solmn intrst and silnt approval. Th aunt spok to ach of thm in
th sam words, about thir halth and hr own, and th halth of Hr
Majsty, “who, thank God, was bttr today.” And ach visitor,
though politnss prvntd his showing impatinc, lft th old woman
with a sns of rlif at having prformd a vxatious duty and did not
rturn to hr th whol vning.
Th young Princss Bolkónskaya had brought som work in a
gold-mbroidrd vlvt bag. Hr prtty littl uppr lip, on which a
dlicat dark down was just prcptibl, was too short for hr tth,
but it liftd all th mor swtly, and was spcially charming whn sh
occasionally drw it down to mt th lowr lip. As is always th cas
with a thoroughly attractiv woman, hr dfct—th shortnss of hr
uppr lip and hr half-opn mouth—smd to b hr own spcial and
pculiar form of bauty. vryon brightnd at th sight of this prtty
young woman, so soon to bcom a mothr, so full of lif and halth, and
carrying hr burdn so lightly. Old mn and dull dispiritd young ons
who lookd at hr, aftr bing in hr company and talking to hr a
littl whil, flt as if thy too wr bcoming, lik hr, full of lif
and halth. All who talkd to hr, and at ach word saw hr bright smil
and th constant glam of hr whit tth, thought that thy wr in a
spcially amiabl mood that day.
Th littl princss wnt round th tabl with quick, short, swaying
stps, hr workbag on hr arm, and gaily sprading out hr drss sat
down on a sofa nar th silvr samovar, as if all sh was doing was a
plasur to hrslf and to all around hr. “I hav brought my work,”
said sh in Frnch, displaying hr bag and addrssing all prsnt.
“Mind, Anntt, I hop you hav not playd a wickd trick on m,”
sh addd, turning to hr hostss. “You wrot that it was to b quit
a small rcption, and just s how badly I am drssd.” And sh
sprad out hr arms to show hr short-waistd, lac-trimmd, dainty gray
drss, girdld with a broad ribbon just blow th brast.
“Soyz tranquill, Lis, you will always b prttir than anyon
ls,” rplid Anna Pávlovna.
“You know,” said th princss in th sam ton of voic and still in
Frnch, turning to a gnral, “my husband is dsrting m? H is going
to gt himslf killd. Tll m what this wrtchd war is for?” sh
addd, addrssing Princ Vasíli, and without waiting for an answr sh
turnd to spak to his daughtr, th bautiful Hlèn.
“What a dlightful woman this littl princss is!” said Princ
Vasíli to Anna Pávlovna.
On of th nxt arrivals was a stout, havily built young man with
clos-croppd hair, spctacls, th light-colord brchs fashionabl
at that tim, a vry high ruffl, and a brown drss coat. This stout
young man was an illgitimat son of Count Bzúkhov, a wll-known
grand of Cathrin’s tim who now lay dying in Moscow. Th young man
had not yt ntrd ithr th military or civil srvic, as h had only
just rturnd from abroad whr h had bn ducatd, and this was his
first apparanc in socity. Anna Pávlovna grtd him with th nod sh
accordd to th lowst hirarchy in hr drawing room. But in spit of
this lowst-grad grting, a look of anxity and far, as at th sight
of somthing too larg and unsuitd to th plac, cam ovr hr fac
whn sh saw Pirr ntr. Though h was crtainly rathr biggr than
th othr mn in th room, hr anxity could only hav rfrnc to
th clvr though shy, but obsrvant and natural, xprssion which
distinguishd him from vryon ls in that drawing room.
“It is vry good of you, Monsiur Pirr, to com and visit a poor
invalid,” said Anna Pávlovna, xchanging an alarmd glanc with hr
aunt as sh conductd him to hr.
Pirr murmurd somthing unintlligibl, and continud to look round as
if in sarch of somthing. On his way to th aunt h bowd to th littl
princss with a plasd smil, as to an intimat acquaintanc.
Anna Pávlovna’s alarm was justifid, for Pirr turnd away from th
aunt without waiting to har hr spch about Hr Majsty’s halth.
Anna Pávlovna in dismay dtaind him with th words: “Do you know th
Abb Morio? H is a most intrsting man.”
“Ys, I hav hard of his schm for prptual pac, and it is vry
intrsting but hardly fasibl.”
“You think so?” rjoind Anna Pávlovna in ordr to say somthing
and gt away to attnd to hr dutis as hostss. But Pirr now
committd a rvrs act of impolitnss. First h had lft a lady bfor
sh had finishd spaking to him, and now h continud to spak to
anothr who wishd to gt away. With his had bnt, and his big ft
sprad apart, h bgan xplaining his rasons for thinking th abb’s
plan chimrical.
“W will talk of it latr,” said Anna Pávlovna with a smil.
And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to bhav, sh
rsumd hr dutis as hostss and continud to listn and watch, rady
to hlp at any point whr th convrsation might happn to flag. As
th forman of a spinning mill, whn h has st th hands to work, gos
round and notics hr a spindl that has stoppd or thr on that
craks or maks mor nois than it should, and hastns to chck th
machin or st it in propr motion, so Anna Pávlovna movd about hr
drawing room, approaching now a silnt, now a too-noisy group, and by a
word or slight rarrangmnt kpt th convrsational machin in stady,
propr, and rgular motion. But amid ths cars hr anxity about
Pirr was vidnt. Sh kpt an anxious watch on him whn h approachd
th group round Mortmart to listn to what was bing said thr, and
again whn h passd to anothr group whos cntr was th abb.
Pirr had bn ducatd abroad, and this rcption at Anna
Pávlovna’s was th first h had attndd in Russia. H knw that all
th intllctual lights of Ptrsburg wr gathrd thr and, lik a
child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing
any clvr convrsation that was to b hard. Sing th slf-confidnt
and rfind xprssion on th facs of thos prsnt h was always
xpcting to har somthing vry profound. At last h cam up to Morio.
Hr th convrsation smd intrsting and h stood waiting for an
opportunity to xprss his own viws, as young popl ar fond of doing.
CHAPTR III
Anna Pávlovna’s rcption was in full swing. Th spindls hummd
stadily and caslssly on all sids. With th xcption of th aunt,
bsid whom sat only on ldrly lady, who with hr thin carworn fac
was rathr out of plac in this brilliant socity, th whol company had
sttld into thr groups. On, chifly masculin, had formd round
th abb. Anothr, of young popl, was groupd round th bautiful
Princss Hlèn, Princ Vasíli’s daughtr, and th littl Princss
Bolkónskaya, vry prtty and rosy, though rathr too plump for hr ag.
Th third group was gathrd round Mortmart and Anna Pávlovna.
Th vicomt was a nic-looking young man with soft faturs and polishd
mannrs, who vidntly considrd himslf a clbrity but out of
politnss modstly placd himslf at th disposal of th circl in
which h found himslf. Anna Pávlovna was obviously srving him up as
a trat to hr gusts. As a clvr maîtr d’hôtl srvs up as a
spcially choic dlicacy a pic of mat that no on who had sn it in
th kitchn would hav card to at, so Anna Pávlovna srvd up to
hr gusts, first th vicomt and thn th abb, as pculiarly choic
morsls. Th group about Mortmart immdiatly bgan discussing th
murdr of th Duc d’nghin. Th vicomt said that th Duc d’nghin
had prishd by his own magnanimity, and that thr wr particular
rasons for Buonapart’s hatrd of him.
“Ah, ys! Do tll us all about it, Vicomt,” said Anna Pávlovna,
with a plasant fling that thr was somthing à la Louis XV in th
sound of that sntnc: “Contz nous çla, Vicomt.”
Th vicomt bowd and smild courtously in tokn of his willingnss to
comply. Anna Pávlovna arrangd a group round him, inviting vryon to
listn to his tal.
“Th vicomt knw th duc prsonally,” whisprd Anna Pávlovna to
on of th gusts. “Th vicomt is a wondrful racontur,” said sh
to anothr. “How vidntly h blongs to th bst socity,” said sh
to a third; and th vicomt was srvd up to th company in th choicst
and most advantagous styl, lik a wll-garnishd joint of roast bf
on a hot dish.
Th vicomt wishd to bgin his story and gav a subtl smil.
“Com ovr hr, Hlèn, dar,” said Anna Pávlovna to th
bautiful young princss who was sitting som way off, th cntr of
anothr group.
Th princss smild. Sh ros with th sam unchanging smil with which
sh had first ntrd th room—th smil of a prfctly bautiful
woman. With a slight rustl of hr whit drss trimmd with moss
and ivy, with a glam of whit shouldrs, glossy hair, and sparkling
diamonds, sh passd btwn th mn who mad way for hr, not looking
at any of thm but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing ach th
privilg of admiring hr bautiful figur and shaply shouldrs,
back, and bosom—which in th fashion of thos days wr vry much
xposd—and sh smd to bring th glamour of a ballroom with hr as
sh movd toward Anna Pávlovna. Hlèn was so lovly that not only
did sh not show any trac of coqutry, but on th contrary sh vn
appard shy of hr unqustionabl and all too victorious bauty. Sh
smd to wish, but to b unabl, to diminish its ffct.
“How lovly!” said vryon who saw hr; and th vicomt liftd his
shouldrs and droppd his ys as if startld by somthing xtraordinary
whn sh took hr sat opposit and bamd upon him also with hr
unchanging smil.
“Madam, I doubt my ability bfor such an audinc,” said h,
smilingly inclining his had.
Th princss rstd hr bar round arm on a littl tabl and considrd
a rply unncssary. Sh smilingly waitd. All th tim th story was
bing told sh sat upright, glancing now at hr bautiful round arm,
altrd in shap by its prssur on th tabl, now at hr still mor
bautiful bosom, on which sh radjustd a diamond ncklac. From tim
to tim sh smoothd th folds of hr drss, and whnvr th story
producd an ffct sh glancd at Anna Pávlovna, at onc adoptd just
th xprssion sh saw on th maid of honor’s fac, and again rlapsd
into hr radiant smil.
Th littl princss had also lft th ta tabl and followd Hlèn.
“Wait a momnt, I’ll gt my work.... Now thn, what ar you
thinking of?” sh wnt on, turning to Princ Hippolyt. “Ftch m my
workbag.”
Thr was a gnral movmnt as th princss, smiling and talking
mrrily to vryon at onc, sat down and gaily arrangd hrslf in hr
sat.
“Now I am all right,” sh said, and asking th vicomt to bgin, sh
took up hr work.
Princ Hippolyt, having brought th workbag, joind th circl and
moving a chair clos to hrs satd himslf bsid hr.
L charmant Hippolyt was surprising by his xtraordinary rsmblanc
to his bautiful sistr, but yt mor by th fact that in spit of
this rsmblanc h was xcdingly ugly. His faturs wr lik his
sistr’s, but whil in hr cas vrything was lit up by a joyous,
slf-satisfid, youthful, and constant smil of animation, and by th
wondrful classic bauty of hr figur, his fac on th contrary
was dulld by imbcility and a constant xprssion of sulln
slf-confidnc, whil his body was thin and wak. His ys, nos, and
mouth all smd puckrd into a vacant, warid grimac, and his arms
and lgs always fll into unnatural positions.
“It’s not going to b a ghost story?” said h, sitting down bsid
th princss and hastily adjusting his lorgntt, as if without this
instrumnt h could not bgin to spak.
“Why no, my dar fllow,” said th astonishd narrator, shrugging
his shouldrs.
“Bcaus I hat ghost storis,” said Princ Hippolyt in a ton
which showd that h only undrstood th maning of his words aftr h
had uttrd thm.
H spok with such slf-confidnc that his harrs could not b sur
whthr what h said was vry witty or vry stupid. H was drssd in
a dark-grn drss coat, kn brchs of th color of cuiss d nymph
ffray, as h calld it, shos, and silk stockings.
Th vicomt told his tal vry natly. It was an ancdot, thn currnt,
to th ffct that th Duc d’nghin had gon scrtly to Paris to
visit Madmoisll Gorg; that at hr hous h cam upon Bonapart,
who also njoyd th famous actrss’ favors, and that in his prsnc
Napolon happnd to fall into on of th fainting fits to which h was
subjct, and was thus at th duc’s mrcy. Th lattr spard him, and
this magnanimity Bonapart subsquntly rpaid by dath.
Th story was vry prtty and intrsting, spcially at th point
whr th rivals suddnly rcognizd on anothr; and th ladis lookd
agitatd.
“Charming!” said Anna Pávlovna with an inquiring glanc at th
littl princss.
“Charming!” whisprd th littl princss, sticking th ndl into
hr work as if to tstify that th intrst and fascination of th story
prvntd hr from going on with it.
Th vicomt apprciatd this silnt prais and smiling gratfully
prpard to continu, but just thn Anna Pávlovna, who had kpt a
watchful y on th young man who so alarmd hr, noticd that h was
talking too loudly and vhmntly with th abb, so sh hurrid to th
rscu. Pirr had managd to start a convrsation with th abb about
th balanc of powr, and th lattr, vidntly intrstd by th young
man’s simpl-mindd agrnss, was xplaining his pt thory. Both
wr talking and listning too agrly and too naturally, which was why
Anna Pávlovna disapprovd.
“Th mans ar ... th balanc of powr in urop and th rights of
th popl,” th abb was saying. “It is only ncssary for on
powrful nation lik Russia—barbaric as sh is said to b—to plac
hrslf disintrstdly at th had of an allianc having for its objct
th maintnanc of th balanc of powr of urop, and it would sav th
world!”
“But how ar you to gt that balanc?” Pirr was bginning.
At that momnt Anna Pávlovna cam up and, looking svrly at Pirr,
askd th Italian how h stood Russian climat. Th Italian’s
fac instantly changd and assumd an offnsivly affctd, sugary
xprssion, vidntly habitual to him whn convrsing with womn.
“I am so nchantd by th brilliancy of th wit and cultur of th
socity, mor spcially of th fminin socity, in which I hav had
th honor of bing rcivd, that I hav not yt had tim to think of
th climat,” said h.
Not ltting th abb and Pirr scap, Anna Pávlovna, th mor
convnintly to kp thm undr obsrvation, brought thm into th
largr circl.
CHAPTR IV
Just thn anothr visitor ntrd th drawing room: Princ Andrw
Bolkónski, th littl princss’ husband. H was a vry handsom young
man, of mdium hight, with firm, clarcut faturs. vrything about
him, from his wary, bord xprssion to his quit, masurd stp,
offrd a most striking contrast to his quit, littl wif. It was
vidnt that h not only knw vryon in th drawing room, but had
found thm to b so tirsom that it warid him to look at or listn to
thm. And among all ths facs that h found so tdious, non smd
to bor him so much as that of his prtty wif. H turnd away from
hr with a grimac that distortd his handsom fac, kissd Anna
Pávlovna’s hand, and scrwing up his ys scannd th whol company.
“You ar off to th war, Princ?” said Anna Pávlovna.
“Gnral Kutúzov,” said Bolkónski, spaking Frnch and strssing
th last syllabl of th gnral’s nam lik a Frnchman, “has bn
plasd to tak m as an aid-d-camp....”
“And Lis, your wif?”
“Sh will go to th country.”
“Ar you not ashamd to dpriv us of your charming wif?”
“Andr,” said his wif, addrssing hr husband in th sam
coquttish mannr in which sh spok to othr mn, “th vicomt has
bn tlling us such a tal about Madmoisll Gorg and Buonapart!”
Princ Andrw scrwd up his ys and turnd away. Pirr, who from
th momnt Princ Andrw ntrd th room had watchd him with glad,
affctionat ys, now cam up and took his arm. Bfor h lookd round
Princ Andrw frownd again, xprssing his annoyanc with whovr was
touching his arm, but whn h saw Pirr’s baming fac h gav him an
unxpctdly kind and plasant smil.
“Thr now!... So you, too, ar in th grat world?” said h to
Pirr.
“I knw you would b hr,” rplid Pirr. “I will com to suppr
with you. May I?” h addd in a low voic so as not to disturb th
vicomt who was continuing his story.
“No, impossibl!” said Princ Andrw, laughing and prssing
Pirr’s hand to show that thr was no nd to ask th qustion. H
wishd to say somthing mor, but at that momnt Princ Vasíli and his
daughtr got up to go and th two young mn ros to lt thm pass.
“You must xcus m, dar Vicomt,” said Princ Vasíli to th
Frnchman, holding him down by th slv in a frindly way to prvnt
his rising. “This unfortunat ft at th ambassador’s dprivs m
of a plasur, and obligs m to intrrupt you. I am vry sorry to lav
your nchanting party,” said h, turning to Anna Pávlovna.
His daughtr, Princss Hlèn, passd btwn th chairs, lightly
holding up th folds of hr drss, and th smil shon still mor
radiantly on hr bautiful fac. Pirr gazd at hr with rapturous,
almost frightnd, ys as sh passd him.
“Vry lovly,” said Princ Andrw.
“Vry,” said Pirr.
In passing Princ Vasíli sizd Pirr’s hand and said to Anna
Pávlovna: “ducat this bar for m! H has bn staying with m
a whol month and this is th first tim I hav sn him in socity.
Nothing is so ncssary for a young man as th socity of clvr
womn.”
Anna Pávlovna smild and promisd to tak Pirr in hand. Sh knw his
fathr to b a connction of Princ Vasíli’s. Th ldrly lady who
had bn sitting with th old aunt ros hurridly and ovrtook Princ
Vasíli in th antroom. All th affctation of intrst sh had assumd
had lft hr kindly and tar-worn fac and it now xprssd only anxity
and far.
“How about my son Borís, Princ?” said sh, hurrying aftr him into
th antroom. “I can’t rmain any longr in Ptrsburg. Tll m what
nws I may tak back to my poor boy.”
Although Princ Vasíli listnd rluctantly and not vry politly
to th ldrly lady, vn btraying som impatinc, sh gav him an
ingratiating and appaling smil, and took his hand that h might not go
away.
“What would it cost you to say a word to th mpror, and thn h
would b transfrrd to th Guards at onc?” said sh.
“Bliv m, Princss, I am rady to do all I can,” answrd Princ
Vasíli, “but it is difficult for m to ask th mpror. I should
advis you to appal to Rumyántsv through Princ Golítsyn. That would
b th bst way.”
Th ldrly lady was a Princss Drubtskáya, blonging to on of th
bst familis in Russia, but sh was poor, and having long bn out of
socity had lost hr formr influntial connctions. Sh had now com to
Ptrsburg to procur an appointmnt in th Guards for hr only son.
It was, in fact, solly to mt Princ Vasíli that sh had obtaind an
invitation to Anna Pávlovna’s rcption and had sat listning to
th vicomt’s story. Princ Vasíli’s words frightnd hr, an
mbittrd look cloudd hr onc handsom fac, but only for a momnt;
thn sh smild again and clutchd Princ Vasíli’s arm mor tightly.
“Listn to m, Princ,” said sh. “I hav nvr yt askd you
for anything and I nvr will again, nor hav I vr rmindd you of my
fathr’s frindship for you; but now I ntrat you for God’s sak to
do this for my son—and I shall always rgard you as a bnfactor,”
sh addd hurridly. “No, don’t b angry, but promis! I hav askd
Golítsyn and h has rfusd. B th kindhartd man you always wr,”
sh said, trying to smil though tars wr in hr ys.
“Papa, w shall b lat,” said Princss Hlèn, turning hr
bautiful had and looking ovr hr classically moldd shouldr as sh
stood waiting by th door.
Influnc in socity, howvr, is a capital which has to b conomizd
if it is to last. Princ Vasíli knw this, and having onc ralizd
that if h askd on bhalf of all who bggd of him, h would soon b
unabl to ask for himslf, h bcam chary of using his influnc. But
in Princss Drubtskáya’s cas h flt, aftr hr scond appal,
somthing lik qualms of conscinc. Sh had rmindd him of what was
quit tru; h had bn indbtd to hr fathr for th first stps in
his carr. Morovr, h could s by hr mannrs that sh was on of
thos womn—mostly mothrs—who, having onc mad up thir minds,
will not rst until thy hav gaind thir nd, and ar prpard if
ncssary to go on insisting day aftr day and hour aftr hour, and vn
to mak scns. This last considration movd him.
“My dar Anna Mikháylovna,” said h with his usual familiarity and
warinss of ton, “it is almost impossibl for m to do what you
ask; but to prov my dvotion to you and how I rspct your fathr’s
mmory, I will do th impossibl—your son shall b transfrrd to th
Guards. Hr is my hand on it. Ar you satisfid?”
“My dar bnfactor! This is what I xpctd from you—I knw your
kindnss!” H turnd to go.
“Wait—just a word! Whn h has bn transfrrd to th Guards...”
sh faltrd. “You ar on good trms with Michal Ilariónovich
Kutúzov ... rcommnd Borís to him as adjutant! Thn I shall b at
rst, and thn...”
Princ Vasíli smild.
“No, I won’t promis that. You don’t know how Kutúzov is pstrd
sinc his appointmnt as Commandr in Chif. H told m himslf that
all th Moscow ladis hav conspird to giv him all thir sons as
adjutants.”
“No, but do promis! I won’t lt you go! My dar bnfactor...”
“Papa,” said his bautiful daughtr in th sam ton as bfor,
“w shall b lat.”
“Wll, au rvoir! Good-by! You har hr?”
“Thn tomorrow you will spak to th mpror?”
“Crtainly; but about Kutúzov, I don’t promis.”
“Do promis, do promis, Vasíli!” crid Anna Mikháylovna as h
wnt, with th smil of a coquttish girl, which at on tim probably
cam naturally to hr, but was now vry ill-suitd to hr carworn fac.
Apparntly sh had forgottn hr ag and by forc of habit mployd
all th old fminin arts. But as soon as th princ had gon hr fac
rsumd its formr cold, artificial xprssion. Sh rturnd to th
group whr th vicomt was still talking, and again prtndd to
listn, whil waiting till it would b tim to lav. Hr task was
accomplishd.
CHAPTR V
“And what do you think of this latst comdy, th coronation at
Milan?” askd Anna Pávlovna, “and of th comdy of th popl of
Gnoa and Lucca laying thir ptitions bfor Monsiur Buonapart, and
Monsiur Buonapart sitting on a thron and granting th ptitions of
th nations? Adorabl! It is nough to mak on’s had whirl! It is as
if th whol world had gon crazy.”
Princ Andrw lookd Anna Pávlovna straight in th fac with a
sarcastic smil.
“‘Diu m la donn, gar à qui la touch!’’ * Thy say h was
vry fin whn h said that,” h rmarkd, rpating th words in
Italian: “‘Dio mi l’ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!’’
     * God has givn it to m, lt him who touchs it bwar!
“I hop this will prov th last drop that will mak th glass run
ovr,” Anna Pávlovna continud. “Th sovrigns will not b abl to
ndur this man who is a mnac to vrything.”
“Th sovrigns? I do not spak of Russia,” said th vicomt, polit
but hoplss: “Th sovrigns, madam... What hav thy don for Louis
XVII, for th Qun, or for Madam lizabth? Nothing!” and h bcam
mor animatd. “And bliv m, thy ar raping th rward of thir
btrayal of th Bourbon caus. Th sovrigns! Why, thy ar snding
ambassadors to complimnt th usurpr.”
And sighing disdainfully, h again changd his position.
Princ Hippolyt, who had bn gazing at th vicomt for som tim
through his lorgntt, suddnly turnd compltly round toward th
littl princss, and having askd for a ndl bgan tracing th Cond
coat of arms on th tabl. H xplaind this to hr with as much gravity
as if sh had askd him to do it.
“Bâton d guuls, ngrêl d guuls d’azur—maison Cond,”
said h.
Th princss listnd, smiling.
“If Buonapart rmains on th thron of Franc a yar longr,” th
vicomt continud, with th air of a man who, in a mattr with which
h is bttr acquaintd than anyon ls, dos not listn to othrs but
follows th currnt of his own thoughts, “things will hav gon too
far. By intrigus, violnc, xil, and xcutions, Frnch socity—I
man good Frnch socity—will hav bn forvr dstroyd, and
thn....”
H shruggd his shouldrs and sprad out his hands. Pirr wishd to
mak a rmark, for th convrsation intrstd him, but Anna Pávlovna,
who had him undr obsrvation, intrruptd:
“Th mpror Alxandr,” said sh, with th mlancholy which
always accompanid any rfrnc of hrs to th Imprial family, “has
dclard that h will lav it to th Frnch popl thmslvs to choos
thir own form of govrnmnt; and I bliv that onc fr from th
usurpr, th whol nation will crtainly throw itslf into th arms
of its rightful king,” sh concludd, trying to b amiabl to th
royalist migrant.
“That is doubtful,” said Princ Andrw. “Monsiur l Vicomt quit
rightly supposs that mattrs hav alrady gon too far. I think it will
b difficult to rturn to th old rgim.”
“From what I hav hard,” said Pirr, blushing and braking into
th convrsation, “almost all th aristocracy has alrady gon ovr to
Bonapart’s sid.”
“It is th Buonapartists who say that,” rplid th vicomt without
looking at Pirr. “At th prsnt tim it is difficult to know th
ral stat of Frnch public opinion.”
“Bonapart has said so,” rmarkd Princ Andrw with a sarcastic
smil.
It was vidnt that h did not lik th vicomt and was aiming his
rmarks at him, though without looking at him.
“‘I showd thm th path to glory, but thy did not follow
it,’” Princ Andrw continud aftr a short silnc, again quoting
Napolon’s words. “‘I opnd my antchambrs and thy crowdd
in.’ I do not know how far h was justifid in saying so.”
“Not in th last,” rplid th vicomt. “Aftr th murdr of th
duc vn th most partial casd to rgard him as a hro. If to som
popl,” h wnt on, turning to Anna Pávlovna, “h vr was a hro,
aftr th murdr of th duc thr was on martyr mor in havn and on
hro lss on arth.”
Bfor Anna Pávlovna and th othrs had tim to smil thir
apprciation of th vicomt’s pigram, Pirr again brok into th
convrsation, and though Anna Pávlovna flt sur h would say somthing
inappropriat, sh was unabl to stop him.
“Th xcution of th Duc d’nghin,” dclard Monsiur Pirr,
“was a political ncssity, and it sms to m that Napolon
showd gratnss of soul by not faring to tak on himslf th whol
rsponsibility of that dd.”
“Diu! Mon Diu!” muttrd Anna Pávlovna in a trrifid whispr.
“What, Monsiur Pirr... Do you considr that assassination shows
gratnss of soul?” said th littl princss, smiling and drawing hr
work narr to hr.
“Oh! Oh!” xclaimd svral voics.
“Capital!” said Princ Hippolyt in nglish, and bgan slapping his
kn with th palm of his hand.
Th vicomt mrly shruggd his shouldrs. Pirr lookd solmnly at his
audinc ovr his spctacls and continud.
“I say so,” h continud dspratly, “bcaus th Bourbons fld
from th Rvolution laving th popl to anarchy, and Napolon alon
undrstood th Rvolution and qulld it, and so for th gnral good,
h could not stop short for th sak of on man’s lif.”
“Won’t you com ovr to th othr tabl?” suggstd Anna
Pávlovna.
But Pirr continud his spch without hding hr.
“No,” crid h, bcoming mor and mor agr, “Napolon is grat
bcaus h ros suprior to th Rvolution, supprssd its abuss,
prsrvd all that was good in it—quality of citiznship and frdom
of spch and of th prss—and only for that rason did h obtain
powr.”
“Ys, if having obtaind powr, without availing himslf of it to
commit murdr h had rstord it to th rightful king, I should hav
calld him a grat man,” rmarkd th vicomt.
“H could not do that. Th popl only gav him powr that h might
rid thm of th Bourbons and bcaus thy saw that h was a grat
man. Th Rvolution was a grand thing!” continud Monsiur Pirr,
btraying by this dsprat and provocativ proposition his xtrm
youth and his wish to xprss all that was in his mind.
“What? Rvolution and rgicid a grand thing?... Wll, aftr that...
But won’t you com to this othr tabl?” rpatd Anna Pávlovna.
“Roussau’s Contrat Social,” said th vicomt with a tolrant
smil.
“I am not spaking of rgicid, I am spaking about idas.”
“Ys: idas of robbry, murdr, and rgicid,” again intrjctd an
ironical voic.
“Thos wr xtrms, no doubt, but thy ar not what is most
important. What is important ar th rights of man, mancipation from
prjudics, and quality of citiznship, and all ths idas Napolon
has rtaind in full forc.”
“Librty and quality,” said th vicomt contmptuously, as if at
last dciding sriously to prov to this youth how foolish his words
wr, “high-sounding words which hav long bn discrditd. Who dos
not lov librty and quality? vn our Saviour prachd librty and
quality. Hav popl sinc th Rvolution bcom happir? On th
contrary. W wantd librty, but Buonapart has dstroyd it.”
Princ Andrw kpt looking with an amusd smil from Pirr to th
vicomt and from th vicomt to thir hostss. In th first momnt of
Pirr’s outburst Anna Pávlovna, dspit hr social xprinc, was
horror-struck. But whn sh saw that Pirr’s sacrilgious words
had not xaspratd th vicomt, and had convincd hrslf that it was
impossibl to stop him, sh rallid hr forcs and joind th vicomt in
a vigorous attack on th orator.
“But, my dar Monsiur Pirr,” said sh, “how do you xplain th
fact of a grat man xcuting a duc—or vn an ordinary man who—is
innocnt and untrid?”
“I should lik,” said th vicomt, “to ask how monsiur xplains
th 18th Brumair; was not that an impostur? It was a swindl, and not
at all lik th conduct of a grat man!”
“And th prisonrs h killd in Africa? That was horribl!” said th
littl princss, shrugging hr shouldrs.
“H’s a low fllow, say what you will,” rmarkd Princ Hippolyt.
Pirr, not knowing whom to answr, lookd at thm all and smild. His
smil was unlik th half-smil of othr popl. Whn h smild,
his grav, vn rathr gloomy, look was instantanously rplacd by
anothr—a childlik, kindly, vn rathr silly look, which smd to
ask forgivnss.
Th vicomt who was mting him for th first tim saw clarly that
this young Jacobin was not so trribl as his words suggstd. All wr
silnt.
“How do you xpct him to answr you all at onc?” said Princ
Andrw. “Bsids, in th actions of a statsman on has to distinguish
btwn his acts as a privat prson, as a gnral, and as an mpror.
So it sms to m.”
“Ys, ys, of cours!” Pirr chimd in, plasd at th arrival of
this rinforcmnt.
“On must admit,” continud Princ Andrw, “that Napolon as a man
was grat on th bridg of Arcola, and in th hospital at Jaffa whr h
gav his hand to th plagu-strickn; but ... but thr ar othr acts
which it is difficult to justify.”
Princ Andrw, who had vidntly wishd to ton down th awkwardnss of
Pirr’s rmarks, ros and mad a sign to his wif that it was tim to
go.
Suddnly Princ Hippolyt startd up making signs to vryon to attnd,
and asking thm all to b satd bgan:
“I was told a charming Moscow story today and must trat you to it.
xcus m, Vicomt—I must tll it in Russian or th point will b
lost....” And Princ Hippolyt bgan to tll his story in such Russian
as a Frnchman would spak aftr spnding about a yar in Russia.
vryon waitd, so mphatically and agrly did h dmand thir
attntion to his story.
“Thr is in Moscow a lady, un dam, and sh is vry stingy. Sh must
hav two footmn bhind hr carriag, and vry big ons. That was hr
tast. And sh had a lady’s maid, also big. Sh said....”
Hr Princ Hippolyt pausd, vidntly collcting his idas with
difficulty.
“Sh said.... Oh ys! Sh said, ‘Girl,’ to th maid, ‘put on a
livry, gt up bhind th carriag, and com with m whil I mak som
calls.’”
Hr Princ Hippolyt spluttrd and burst out laughing long bfor his
audinc, which producd an ffct unfavorabl to th narrator. Svral
prsons, among thm th ldrly lady and Anna Pávlovna, did howvr
smil.
“Sh wnt. Suddnly thr was a grat wind. Th girl lost hr hat and
hr long hair cam down....” Hr h could contain himslf no
longr and wnt on, btwn gasps of laughtr: “And th whol world
knw....”
And so th ancdot ndd. Though it was unintlligibl why h had told
it, or why it had to b told in Russian, still Anna Pávlovna and th
othrs apprciatd Princ Hippolyt’s social tact in so agrably
nding Pirr’s unplasant and unamiabl outburst. Aftr th ancdot
th convrsation brok up into insignificant small talk about th last
and nxt balls, about thatricals, and who would mt whom, and whn and
whr.
CHAPTR VI
Having thankd Anna Pávlovna for hr charming soir, th gusts bgan
to tak thir lav.
Pirr was ungainly. Stout, about th avrag hight, broad, with hug
rd hands; h did not know, as th saying is, how to ntr a drawing
room and still lss how to lav on; that is, how to say somthing
particularly agrabl bfor going away. Bsids this h was
absnt-mindd. Whn h ros to go, h took up instad of his own, th
gnral’s thr-cornrd hat, and hld it, pulling at th plum,
till th gnral askd him to rstor it. All his absnt-minddnss and
inability to ntr a room and convrs in it was, howvr, rdmd by
his kindly, simpl, and modst xprssion. Anna Pávlovna turnd toward
him and, with a Christian mildnss that xprssd forgivnss of his
indiscrtion, noddd and said: “I hop to s you again, but I also
hop you will chang your opinions, my dar Monsiur Pirr.”
Whn sh said this, h did not rply and only bowd, but again vrybody
saw his smil, which said nothing, unlss prhaps, “Opinions ar
opinions, but you s what a capital, good-naturd fllow I am.” And
vryon, including Anna Pávlovna, flt this.
Princ Andrw had gon out into th hall, and, turning his shouldrs
to th footman who was hlping him on with his cloak, listnd
indiffrntly to his wif’s chattr with Princ Hippolyt who had also
com into th hall. Princ Hippolyt stood clos to th prtty, prgnant
princss, and stard fixdly at hr through his yglass.
“Go in, Anntt, or you will catch cold,” said th littl princss,
taking lav of Anna Pávlovna. “It is sttld,” sh addd in a low
voic.
Anna Pávlovna had alrady managd to spak to Lis about th match sh
contmplatd btwn Anatol and th littl princss’ sistr-in-law.
“I rly on you, my dar,” said Anna Pávlovna, also in a low ton.
“Writ to hr and lt m know how hr fathr looks at th mattr. Au
rvoir! ”—and sh lft th hall.
Princ Hippolyt approachd th littl princss and, bnding his fac
clos to hr, bgan to whispr somthing.
Two footmn, th princss’ and his own, stood holding a shawl and
a cloak, waiting for th convrsation to finish. Thy listnd to
th Frnch sntncs which to thm wr maninglss, with an air of
undrstanding but not wishing to appar to do so. Th princss as usual
spok smilingly and listnd with a laugh.
“I am vry glad I did not go to th ambassador’s,” said Princ
Hippolyt “—so dull—. It has bn a dlightful vning, has it
not? Dlightful!”
“Thy say th ball will b vry good,” rplid th princss, drawing
up hr downy littl lip. “All th prtty womn in socity will b
thr.”
“Not all, for you will not b thr; not all,” said Princ Hippolyt
smiling joyfully; and snatching th shawl from th footman, whom h
vn pushd asid, h bgan wrapping it round th princss. ithr from
awkwardnss or intntionally (no on could hav said which) aftr th
shawl had bn adjustd h kpt his arm around hr for a long tim, as
though mbracing hr.
Still smiling, sh gracfully movd away, turning and glancing at hr
husband. Princ Andrw’s ys wr closd, so wary and slpy did h
sm.
“Ar you rady?” h askd his wif, looking past hr.
Princ Hippolyt hurridly put on his cloak, which in th latst fashion
rachd to his vry hls, and, stumbling in it, ran out into th porch
following th princss, whom a footman was hlping into th carriag.
“Princss, au rvoir,” crid h, stumbling with his tongu as wll
as with his ft.
Th princss, picking up hr drss, was taking hr sat in th dark
carriag, hr husband was adjusting his sabr; Princ Hippolyt, undr
prtns of hlping, was in vryon’s way.
“Allow m, sir,” said Princ Andrw in Russian in a cold,
disagrabl ton to Princ Hippolyt who was blocking his path.
“I am xpcting you, Pirr,” said th sam voic, but gntly and
affctionatly.
Th postilion startd, th carriag whls rattld. Princ Hippolyt
laughd spasmodically as h stood in th porch waiting for th vicomt
whom h had promisd to tak hom.
“Wll, mon chr,” said th vicomt, having satd himslf bsid
Hippolyt in th carriag, “your littl princss is vry nic, vry
nic indd, quit Frnch,” and h kissd th tips of his fingrs.
Hippolyt burst out laughing.
“Do you know, you ar a trribl chap for all your innocnt airs,”
continud th vicomt. “I pity th poor husband, that littl officr
who givs himslf th airs of a monarch.”
Hippolyt spluttrd again, and amid his laughtr said, “And you wr
saying that th Russian ladis ar not qual to th Frnch? On has to
know how to dal with thm.”
Pirr raching th hous first wnt into Princ Andrw’s study lik
on quit at hom, and from habit immdiatly lay down on th sofa, took
from th shlf th first book that cam to his hand (it was Casar’s
Commntaris), and rsting on his lbow, bgan rading it in th middl.
“What hav you don to Mll Schrr? Sh will b quit ill now,”
said Princ Andrw, as h ntrd th study, rubbing his small whit
hands.
Pirr turnd his whol body, making th sofa crak. H liftd his agr
fac to Princ Andrw, smild, and wavd his hand.
“That abb is vry intrsting but h dos not s th thing in th
right light.... In my opinion prptual pac is possibl but—I do not
know how to xprss it ... not by a balanc of political powr....”
It was vidnt that Princ Andrw was not intrstd in such abstract
convrsation.
“On can’t vrywhr say all on thinks, mon chr. Wll, hav
you at last dcidd on anything? Ar you going to b a guardsman or a
diplomatist?” askd Princ Andrw aftr a momntary silnc.
Pirr sat up on th sofa, with his lgs tuckd undr him.
“Rally, I don’t yt know. I don’t lik ithr th on or th
othr.”
“But you must dcid on somthing! Your fathr xpcts it.”
Pirr at th ag of tn had bn snt abroad with an abb as tutor,
and had rmaind away till h was twnty. Whn h rturnd to Moscow
his fathr dismissd th abb and said to th young man, “Now go
to Ptrsburg, look round, and choos your profssion. I will agr to
anything. Hr is a lttr to Princ Vasíli, and hr is mony. Writ
to m all about it, and I will hlp you in vrything.” Pirr had
alrady bn choosing a carr for thr months, and had not dcidd
on anything. It was about this choic that Princ Andrw was spaking.
Pirr rubbd his forhad.
“But h must b a Frmason,” said h, rfrring to th abb whom
h had mt that vning.
“That is all nonsns.” Princ Andrw again intrruptd him, “lt
us talk businss. Hav you bn to th Hors Guards?”
“No, I hav not; but this is what I hav bn thinking and wantd
to tll you. Thr is a war now against Napolon. If it wr a war for
frdom I could undrstand it and should b th first to ntr th army;
but to hlp ngland and Austria against th gratst man in th world is
not right.”
Princ Andrw only shruggd his shouldrs at Pirr’s childish words.
H put on th air of on who finds it impossibl to rply to such
nonsns, but it would in fact hav bn difficult to giv any othr
answr than th on Princ Andrw gav to this naïv qustion.
“If no on fought xcpt on his own conviction, thr would b no
wars,” h said.
“And that would b splndid,” said Pirr.
Princ Andrw smild ironically.
“Vry likly it would b splndid, but it will nvr com about....”
“Wll, why ar you going to th war?” askd Pirr.
“What for? I don’t know. I must. Bsids that I am going....” H
pausd. “I am going bcaus th lif I am lading hr dos not suit
m!”
CHAPTR VII
Th rustl of a woman’s drss was hard in th nxt room. Princ
Andrw shook himslf as if waking up, and his fac assumd th look it
had had in Anna Pávlovna’s drawing room. Pirr rmovd his ft from
th sofa. Th princss cam in. Sh had changd hr gown for a hous
drss as frsh and lgant as th othr. Princ Andrw ros and politly
placd a chair for hr.
“How is it,” sh bgan, as usual in Frnch, sttling down briskly
and fussily in th asy chair, “how is it Anntt nvr got marrid?
How stupid you mn all ar not to hav marrid hr! xcus m for saying
so, but you hav no sns about womn. What an argumntativ fllow you
ar, Monsiur Pirr!”
“And I am still arguing with your husband. I can’t undrstand why h
wants to go to th war,” rplid Pirr, addrssing th princss
with non of th mbarrassmnt so commonly shown by young mn in thir
intrcours with young womn.
Th princss startd. vidntly Pirr’s words touchd hr to th
quick.
“Ah, that is just what I tll him!” said sh. “I don’t
undrstand it; I don’t in th last undrstand why mn can’t liv
without wars. How is it that w womn don’t want anything of th kind,
don’t nd it? Now you shall judg btwn us. I always tll him: Hr
h is Uncl’s aid-d-camp, a most brilliant position. H is so
wll known, so much apprciatd by vryon. Th othr day at th
Apráksins’ I hard a lady asking, ‘Is that th famous Princ
Andrw?’ I did indd.” Sh laughd. “H is so wll rcivd
vrywhr. H might asily bcom aid-d-camp to th mpror. You know
th mpror spok to him most graciously. Anntt and I wr spaking of
how to arrang it. What do you think?”
Pirr lookd at his frind and, noticing that h did not lik th
convrsation, gav no rply.
“Whn ar you starting?” h askd.
“Oh, don’t spak of his going, don’t! I won’t har it spokn
of,” said th princss in th sam ptulantly playful ton in which
sh had spokn to Hippolyt in th drawing room and which was so plainly
ill-suitd to th family circl of which Pirr was almost a mmbr.
“Today whn I rmmbrd that all ths dlightful associations
must b brokn off ... and thn you know, Andr...” (sh lookd
significantly at hr husband) “I’m afraid, I’m afraid!” sh
whisprd, and a shuddr ran down hr back.
Hr husband lookd at hr as if surprisd to notic that somon bsids
Pirr and himslf was in th room, and addrssd hr in a ton of
frigid politnss.
“What is it you ar afraid of, Lis? I don’t undrstand,” said h.
“Thr, what gotists mn all ar: all, all gotists! Just for a whim
of his own, goodnss only knows why, h lavs m and locks m up alon
in th country.”
“With my fathr and sistr, rmmbr,” said Princ Andrw gntly.
“Alon all th sam, without my frinds.... And h xpcts m not to
b afraid.”
Hr ton was now qurulous and hr lip drawn up, giving hr not a
joyful, but an animal, squirrl-lik xprssion. Sh pausd as if sh
flt it indcorous to spak of hr prgnancy bfor Pirr, though th
gist of th mattr lay in that.
“I still can’t undrstand what you ar afraid of,” said Princ
Andrw slowly, not taking his ys off his wif.
Th princss blushd, and raisd hr arms with a gstur of dspair.
“No, Andrw, I must say you hav changd. Oh, how you hav....”
“Your doctor tlls you to go to bd arlir,” said Princ Andrw.
“You had bttr go.”
Th princss said nothing, but suddnly hr short downy lip quivrd.
Princ Andrw ros, shruggd his shouldrs, and walkd about th room.
Pirr lookd ovr his spctacls with naïv surpris, now at him and
now at hr, movd as if about to ris too, but changd his mind.
“Why should I mind Monsiur Pirr bing hr?” xclaimd th littl
princss suddnly, hr prtty fac all at onc distortd by a tarful
grimac. “I hav long wantd to ask you, Andrw, why you hav changd
so to m? What hav I don to you? You ar going to th war and hav no
pity for m. Why is it?”
“Lis!” was all Princ Andrw said. But that on word xprssd
an ntraty, a thrat, and abov all conviction that sh would hrslf
rgrt hr words. But sh wnt on hurridly:
“You trat m lik an invalid or a child. I s it all! Did you bhav
lik that six months ago?”
“Lis, I bg you to dsist,” said Princ Andrw still mor
mphatically.
Pirr, who had bn growing mor and mor agitatd as h listnd to
all this, ros and approachd th princss. H smd unabl to bar th
sight of tars and was rady to cry himslf.
“Calm yourslf, Princss! It sms so to you bcaus.... I assur you
I myslf hav xprincd ... and so ... bcaus ... No, xcus m!
An outsidr is out of plac hr.... No, don’t distrss yourslf....
Good-by!”
Princ Andrw caught him by th hand.
“No, wait, Pirr! Th princss is too kind to wish to dpriv m of
th plasur of spnding th vning with you.”
“No, h thinks only of himslf,” muttrd th princss without
rstraining hr angry tars.
“Lis!” said Princ Andrw dryly, raising his voic to th pitch
which indicats that patinc is xhaustd.
Suddnly th angry, squirrl-lik xprssion of th princss’ prtty
fac changd into a winning and pitous look of far. Hr bautiful ys
glancd askanc at hr husband’s fac, and hr own assumd th timid,
dprcating xprssion of a dog whn it rapidly but fbly wags its
drooping tail.
“Mon Diu, mon Diu!” sh muttrd, and lifting hr drss with on
hand sh wnt up to hr husband and kissd him on th forhad.
“Good night, Lis,” said h, rising and courtously kissing hr hand
as h would hav don to a strangr.
CHAPTR VIII
Th frinds wr silnt. Nithr card to bgin talking. Pirr
continually glancd at Princ Andrw; Princ Andrw rubbd his forhad
with his small hand.
“Lt us go and hav suppr,” h said with a sigh, going to th door.
Thy ntrd th lgant, nwly dcoratd, and luxurious dining room.
vrything from th tabl napkins to th silvr, china, and glass bor
that imprint of nwnss found in th housholds of th nwly marrid.
Halfway through suppr Princ Andrw land his lbows on th tabl and,
with a look of nrvous agitation such as Pirr had nvr bfor sn on
his fac, bgan to talk—as on who has long had somthing on his mind
and suddnly dtrmins to spak out.
“Nvr, nvr marry, my dar fllow! That’s my advic: nvr marry
till you can say to yourslf that you hav don all you ar capabl of,
and until you hav casd to lov th woman of your choic and hav sn
hr plainly as sh is, or ls you will mak a crul and irrvocabl
mistak. Marry whn you ar old and good for nothing—or all that is
good and nobl in you will b lost. It will all b wastd on trifls.
Ys! Ys! Ys! Don’t look at m with such surpris. If you marry
xpcting anything from yourslf in th futur, you will fl at vry
stp that for you all is ndd, all is closd xcpt th drawing
room, whr you will b rangd sid by sid with a court lacky and an
idiot!... But what’s th good?...” and h wavd his arm.
Pirr took off his spctacls, which mad his fac sm diffrnt and
th good-naturd xprssion still mor apparnt, and gazd at his frind
in amazmnt.
“My wif,” continud Princ Andrw, “is an xcllnt woman, on
of thos rar womn with whom a man’s honor is saf; but, O God, what
would I not giv now to b unmarrid! You ar th first and only on to
whom I mntion this, bcaus I lik you.”
As h said this Princ Andrw was lss than vr lik that Bolkónski
who had lolld in Anna Pávlovna’s asy chairs and with half-closd
ys had uttrd Frnch phrass btwn his tth. vry muscl of his
thin fac was now quivring with nrvous xcitmnt; his ys, in which
th fir of lif had smd xtinguishd, now flashd with brilliant
light. It was vidnt that th mor liflss h smd at ordinary
tims, th mor impassiond h bcam in ths momnts of almost morbid
irritation.
“You don’t undrstand why I say this,” h continud, “but it is
th whol story of lif. You talk of Bonapart and his carr,” said
h (though Pirr had not mntiond Bonapart), “but Bonapart whn
h workd wnt stp by stp toward his goal. H was fr, h had nothing
but his aim to considr, and h rachd it. But ti yourslf up with
a woman and, lik a chaind convict, you los all frdom! And all you
hav of hop and strngth mrly wighs you down and tormnts you with
rgrt. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality—ths ar
th nchantd circl I cannot scap from. I am now going to th war,
th gratst war thr vr was, and I know nothing and am fit for
nothing. I am vry amiabl and hav a caustic wit,” continud Princ
Andrw, “and at Anna Pávlovna’s thy listn to m. And that stupid
st without whom my wif cannot xist, and thos womn.... If you only
knw what thos socity womn ar, and womn in gnral! My fathr is
right. Slfish, vain, stupid, trivial in vrything—that’s what
womn ar whn you s thm in thir tru colors! Whn you mt thm
in socity it sms as if thr wr somthing in thm, but thr’s
nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don’t marry, my dar fllow; don’t
marry!” concludd Princ Andrw.
“It sms funny to m,” said Pirr, “that you, you should
considr yourslf incapabl and your lif a spoild lif. You hav
vrything bfor you, vrything. And you....”
H did not finish his sntnc, but his ton showd how highly h
thought of his frind and how much h xpctd of him in th futur.
“How can h talk lik that?” thought Pirr. H considrd his
frind a modl of prfction bcaus Princ Andrw possssd in th
highst dgr just th vry qualitis Pirr lackd, and which might
b bst dscribd as strngth of will. Pirr was always astonishd at
Princ Andrw’s calm mannr of trating vrybody, his xtraordinary
mmory, his xtnsiv rading (h had rad vrything, knw vrything,
and had an opinion about vrything), but abov all at his capacity for
work and study. And if Pirr was oftn struck by Andrw’s lack
of capacity for philosophical mditation (to which h himslf was
particularly addictd), h rgardd vn this not as a dfct but as a
sign of strngth.
vn in th bst, most frindly and simplst rlations of lif, prais
and commndation ar ssntial, just as gras is ncssary to whls
that thy may run smoothly.
“My part is playd out,” said Princ Andrw. “What’s th us of
talking about m? Lt us talk about you,” h addd aftr a silnc,
smiling at his rassuring thoughts.
That smil was immdiatly rflctd on Pirr’s fac.
“But what is thr to say about m?” said Pirr, his fac rlaxing
into a carlss, mrry smil. “What am I? An illgitimat son!”
H suddnly blushd crimson, and it was plain that h had mad a grat
ffort to say this. “Without a nam and without mans... And it
rally...” But h did not say what “it rally” was. “For th
prsnt I am fr and am all right. Only I havn’t th last ida what
I am to do; I wantd to consult you sriously.”
Princ Andrw lookd kindly at him, yt his glanc—frindly and
affctionat as it was—xprssd a sns of his own supriority.
“I am fond of you, spcially as you ar th on liv man among our
whol st. Ys, you’r all right! Choos what you will; it’s all th
sam. You’ll b all right anywhr. But look hr: giv up visiting
thos Kurágins and lading that sort of lif. It suits you so
badly—all this dbauchry, dissipation, and th rst of it!”
“What would you hav, my dar fllow?” answrd Pirr, shrugging
his shouldrs. “Womn, my dar fllow; womn!”
“I don’t undrstand it,” rplid Princ Andrw. “Womn who ar
comm il faut, that’s a diffrnt mattr; but th Kurágins’ st of
womn, ‘womn and win’ I don’t undrstand!”
Pirr was staying at Princ Vasíli Kurágin’s and sharing th
dissipatd lif of his son Anatol, th son whom thy wr planning to
rform by marrying him to Princ Andrw’s sistr.
“Do you know?” said Pirr, as if suddnly struck by a happy
thought, “sriously, I hav long bn thinking of it.... Lading such
a lif I can’t dcid or think proprly about anything. On’s had
achs, and on spnds all on’s mony. H askd m for tonight, but I
won’t go.”
“You giv m your word of honor not to go?”
“On my honor!”
CHAPTR IX
It was past on o’clock whn Pirr lft his frind. It was a
cloudlss, northrn, summr night. Pirr took an opn cab intnding
to driv straight hom. But th narr h drw to th hous th mor h
flt th impossibility of going to slp on such a night. It was light
nough to s a long way in th dsrtd strt and it smd mor lik
morning or vning than night. On th way Pirr rmmbrd that Anatol
Kurágin was xpcting th usual st for cards that vning, aftr which
thr was gnrally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind
Pirr was vry fond of.
“I should lik to go to Kurágin’s,” thought h.
But h immdiatly rcalld his promis to Princ Andrw not to go
thr. Thn, as happns to popl of wak charactr, h dsird so
passionatly onc mor to njoy that dissipation h was so accustomd to
that h dcidd to go. Th thought immdiatly occurrd to him that his
promis to Princ Andrw was of no account, bcaus bfor h gav it
h had alrady promisd Princ Anatol to com to his gathring;
“bsids,” thought h, “all such ‘words of honor’ ar
convntional things with no dfinit maning, spcially if
on considrs that by tomorrow on may b dad, or somthing so
xtraordinary may happn to on that honor and dishonor will b all th
sam!” Pirr oftn indulgd in rflctions of this sort, nullifying
all his dcisions and intntions. H wnt to Kurágin’s.
Raching th larg hous nar th Hors Guards’ barracks, in which
Anatol livd, Pirr ntrd th lightd porch, ascndd th stairs,
and wnt in at th opn door. Thr was no on in th antroom; mpty
bottls, cloaks, and ovrshos wr lying about; thr was a smll of
alcohol, and sounds of voics and shouting in th distanc.
Cards and suppr wr ovr, but th visitors had not yt disprsd.
Pirr thrw off his cloak and ntrd th first room, in which wr th
rmains of suppr. A footman, thinking no on saw him, was drinking on
th sly what was lft in th glasss. From th third room cam sounds of
laughtr, th shouting of familiar voics, th growling of a bar, and
gnral commotion. Som ight or nin young mn wr crowding anxiously
round an opn window. Thr othrs wr romping with a young bar, on
pulling him by th chain and trying to st him at th othrs.
“I bt a hundrd on Stvns!” shoutd on.
“Mind, no holding on!” crid anothr.
“I bt on Dólokhov!” crid a third. “Kurágin, you part our
hands.”
“Thr, lav Bruin alon; hr’s a bt on.”
“At on draught, or h loss!” shoutd a fourth.
“Jacob, bring a bottl!” shoutd th host, a tall, handsom fllow
who stood in th midst of th group, without a coat, and with his fin
linn shirt unfastnd in front. “Wait a bit, you fllows.... Hr is
Ptya! Good man!” crid h, addrssing Pirr.
Anothr voic, from a man of mdium hight with clar blu ys,
particularly striking among all ths drunkn voics by its sobr
ring, crid from th window: “Com hr; part th bts!” This was
Dólokhov, an officr of th Smënov rgimnt, a notorious gamblr and
dulist, who was living with Anatol. Pirr smild, looking about him
mrrily.
“I don’t undrstand. What’s it all about?”
“Wait a bit, h is not drunk yt! A bottl hr,” said Anatol, and
taking a glass from th tabl h wnt up to Pirr.
“First of all you must drink!”
Pirr drank on glass aftr anothr, looking from undr his brows at
th tipsy gusts who wr again crowding round th window, and listning
to thir chattr. Anatol kpt on rfilling Pirr’s glass whil
xplaining that Dólokhov was btting with Stvns, an nglish naval
officr, that h would drink a bottl of rum sitting on th outr ldg
of th third floor window with his lgs hanging out.
“Go on, you must drink it all,” said Anatol, giving Pirr th last
glass, “or I won’t lt you go!”
“No, I won’t,” said Pirr, pushing Anatol asid, and h wnt up
to th window.
Dólokhov was holding th nglishman’s hand and clarly and distinctly
rpating th trms of th bt, addrssing himslf particularly to
Anatol and Pirr.
Dólokhov was of mdium hight, with curly hair and light-blu ys. H
was about twnty-fiv. Lik all infantry officrs h wor no mustach,
so that his mouth, th most striking fatur of his fac, was clarly
sn. Th lins of that mouth wr rmarkably finly curvd. Th middl
of th uppr lip formd a sharp wdg and closd firmly on th firm
lowr on, and somthing lik two distinct smils playd continually
round th two cornrs of th mouth; this, togthr with th rsolut,
insolnt intllignc of his ys, producd an ffct which mad it
impossibl not to notic his fac. Dólokhov was a man of small mans
and no connctions. Yt, though Anatol spnt tns of thousands of
rubls, Dólokhov livd with him and had placd himslf on such a
footing that all who knw thm, including Anatol himslf, rspctd him
mor than thy did Anatol. Dólokhov could play all gams and narly
always won. Howvr much h drank, h nvr lost his clarhaddnss.
Both Kurágin and Dólokhov wr at that tim notorious among th raks
and scapgracs of Ptrsburg.
Th bottl of rum was brought. Th window fram which prvntd anyon
from sitting on th outr sill was bing forcd out by two footmn, who
wr vidntly flurrid and intimidatd by th dirctions and shouts of
th gntlmn around.
Anatol with his swaggring air strod up to th window. H wantd to
smash somthing. Pushing away th footmn h tuggd at th fram, but
could not mov it. H smashd a pan.
“You hav a try, Hrculs,” said h, turning to Pirr.
Pirr sizd th crossbam, tuggd, and wrnchd th oak fram out with
a crash.
“Tak it right out, or thy’ll think I’m holding on,” said
Dólokhov.
“Is th nglishman bragging?... h? Is it all right?” said Anatol.
“First-rat,” said Pirr, looking at Dólokhov, who with a bottl
of rum in his hand was approaching th window, from which th light of
th sky, th dawn mrging with th aftrglow of sunst, was visibl.
Dólokhov, th bottl of rum still in his hand, jumpd onto th window
sill. “Listn!” crid h, standing thr and addrssing thos in th
room. All wr silnt.
“I bt fifty imprials”—h spok Frnch that th nglishman might
undrstand him, but h did not spak it vry wll—“I bt fifty
imprials ... or do you wish to mak it a hundrd?” addd h,
addrssing th nglishman.
“No, fifty,” rplid th lattr.
“All right. Fifty imprials ... that I will drink a whol bottl of
rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outsid th window on this
spot” (h stoopd and pointd to th sloping ldg outsid th window)
“and without holding on to anything. Is that right?”
“Quit right,” said th nglishman.
Anatol turnd to th nglishman and taking him by on of th buttons
of his coat and looking down at him—th nglishman was short—bgan
rpating th trms of th wagr to him in nglish.
“Wait!” crid Dólokhov, hammring with th bottl on th window
sill to attract attntion. “Wait a bit, Kurágin. Listn! If
anyon ls dos th sam, I will pay him a hundrd imprials. Do you
undrstand?”
Th nglishman noddd, but gav no indication whthr h intndd to
accpt this challng or not. Anatol did not rlas him, and though
h kpt nodding to show that h undrstood, Anatol wnt on translating
Dólokhov’s words into nglish. A thin young lad, an hussar of th
Lif Guards, who had bn losing that vning, climbd on th window
sill, land ovr, and lookd down.
“Oh! Oh! Oh!” h muttrd, looking down from th window at th
stons of th pavmnt.
“Shut up!” crid Dólokhov, pushing him away from th window. Th
lad jumpd awkwardly back into th room, tripping ovr his spurs.
Placing th bottl on th window sill whr h could rach it asily,
Dólokhov climbd carfully and slowly through th window and lowrd
his lgs. Prssing against both sids of th window, h adjustd himslf
on his sat, lowrd his hands, movd a littl to th right and thn to
th lft, and took up th bottl. Anatol brought two candls and
placd thm on th window sill, though it was alrady quit light.
Dólokhov’s back in his whit shirt, and his curly had, wr lit
up from both sids. vryon crowdd to th window, th nglishman in
front. Pirr stood smiling but silnt. On man, oldr than th othrs
prsnt, suddnly pushd forward with a scard and angry look and wantd
to siz hold of Dólokhov’s shirt.
“I say, this is folly! H’ll b killd,” said this mor snsibl
man.
Anatol stoppd him.
“Don’t touch him! You’ll startl him and thn h’ll b killd.
h?... What thn?... h?”
Dólokhov turnd round and, again holding on with both hands, arrangd
himslf on his sat.
“If anyon coms mddling again,” said h, mitting th words
sparatly through his thin comprssd lips, “I will throw him down
thr. Now thn!”
Saying this h again turnd round, droppd his hands, took th bottl
and liftd it to his lips, thrw back his had, and raisd his fr hand
to balanc himslf. On of th footmn who had stoopd to pick up som
brokn glass rmaind in that position without taking his ys from th
window and from Dólokhov’s back. Anatol stood rct with staring
ys. Th nglishman lookd on sidways, pursing up his lips. Th man
who had wishd to stop th affair ran to a cornr of th room and thrw
himslf on a sofa with his fac to th wall. Pirr hid his fac, from
which a faint smil forgot to fad though his faturs now xprssd
horror and far. All wr still. Pirr took his hands from his ys.
Dólokhov still sat in th sam position, only his had was thrown
furthr back till his curly hair touchd his shirt collar, and th hand
holding th bottl was liftd highr and highr and trmbld with th
ffort. Th bottl was mptying prcptibly and rising still highr
and his had tilting yt furthr back. “Why is it so long?” thought
Pirr. It smd to him that mor than half an hour had lapsd.
Suddnly Dólokhov mad a backward movmnt with his spin, and his arm
trmbld nrvously; this was sufficint to caus his whol body to slip
as h sat on th sloping ldg. As h bgan slipping down, his had and
arm wavrd still mor with th strain. On hand movd as if to clutch
th window sill, but rfraind from touching it. Pirr again covrd
his ys and thought h would nvr opn thm again. Suddnly h was
awar of a stir all around. H lookd up: Dólokhov was standing on th
window sill, with a pal but radiant fac.
“It’s mpty.”
H thrw th bottl to th nglishman, who caught it natly. Dólokhov
jumpd down. H smlt strongly of rum.
“Wll don!... Fin fllow!... Thr’s a bt for you!... Dvil tak
you!” cam from diffrnt sids.
Th nglishman took out his purs and bgan counting out th mony.
Dólokhov stood frowning and did not spak. Pirr jumpd upon th
window sill.
“Gntlmn, who wishs to bt with m? I’ll do th sam thing!”
h suddnly crid. “vn without a bt, thr! Tll thm to bring m a
bottl. I’ll do it.... Bring a bottl!”
“Lt him do it, lt him do it,” said Dólokhov, smiling.
“What nxt? Hav you gon mad?... No on would lt you!... Why, you go
giddy vn on a staircas,” xclaimd svral voics.
“I’ll drink it! Lt’s hav a bottl of rum!” shoutd Pirr,
banging th tabl with a dtrmind and drunkn gstur and prparing to
climb out of th window.
Thy sizd him by his arms; but h was so strong that vryon who
touchd him was snt flying.
“No, you’ll nvr manag him that way,” said Anatol. “Wait a
bit and I’ll gt round him.... Listn! I’ll tak your bt tomorrow,
but now w ar all going to ——’s.”
“Com on thn,” crid Pirr. “Com on!... And w’ll tak Bruin
with us.”
And h caught th bar, took it in his arms, liftd it from th ground,
and bgan dancing round th room with it.
CHAPTR X
Princ Vasíli kpt th promis h had givn to Princss Drubtskáya
who had spokn to him on bhalf of hr only son Borís on th vning of
Anna Pávlovna’s soir. Th mattr was mntiond to th mpror, an
xcption mad, and Borís transfrrd into th rgimnt of Smënov
Guards with th rank of cornt. H rcivd, howvr, no appointmnt
to Kutúzov’s staff dspit all Anna Mikháylovna’s ndavors and
ntratis. Soon aftr Anna Pávlovna’s rcption Anna Mikháylovna
rturnd to Moscow and wnt straight to hr rich rlations, th
Rostóvs, with whom sh stayd whn in th town and whr hr darling
Bóry, who had only just ntrd a rgimnt of th lin and was bing
at onc transfrrd to th Guards as a cornt, had bn ducatd from
childhood and livd for yars at a tim. Th Guards had alrady lft
Ptrsburg on th tnth of August, and hr son, who had rmaind in
Moscow for his quipmnt, was to join thm on th march to Radzivílov.
It was St. Natalia’s day and th nam day of two of th Rostóvs—th
mothr and th youngst daughtr—both namd Nataly. vr sinc
th morning, carriags with six horss had bn coming and going
continually, bringing visitors to th Countss Rostóva’s big hous on
th Povarskáya, so wll known to all Moscow. Th countss hrslf and
hr handsom ldst daughtr wr in th drawing room with th visitors
who cam to congratulat, and who constantly succdd on anothr in
rlays.
Th countss was a woman of about forty-fiv, with a thin Orintal typ
of fac, vidntly worn out with childbaring—sh had had twlv.
A languor of motion and spch, rsulting from waknss, gav hr a
distinguishd air which inspird rspct. Princss Anna Mikháylovna
Drubtskáya, who as a mmbr of th houshold was also satd in th
drawing room, hlpd to rciv and ntrtain th visitors. Th young
popl wr in on of th innr rooms, not considring it ncssary to
tak part in rciving th visitors. Th count mt th gusts and saw
thm off, inviting thm all to dinnr.
“I am vry, vry gratful to you, mon chr,” or “ma chèr”—h
calld vryon without xcption and without th slightst variation
in his ton, “my dar,” whthr thy wr abov or blow him in
rank—“I thank you for myslf and for our two dar ons whos nam
day w ar kping. But mind you com to dinnr or I shall b offndd,
ma chèr! On bhalf of th whol family I bg you to com, mon chr!”
Ths words h rpatd to vryon without xcption or variation, and
with th sam xprssion on his full, chrful, clan-shavn fac, th
sam firm prssur of th hand and th sam quick, rpatd bows. As
soon as h had sn a visitor off h rturnd to on of thos who wr
still in th drawing room, drw a chair toward him or hr, and jauntily
sprading out his lgs and putting his hands on his kns with th air
of a man who njoys lif and knows how to liv, h swayd to and
fro with dignity, offrd surmiss about th wathr, or touchd on
qustions of halth, somtims in Russian and somtims in vry bad but
slf-confidnt Frnch; thn again, lik a man wary but unflinching in
th fulfillmnt of duty, h ros to s som visitors off and, stroking
his scanty gray hairs ovr his bald patch, also askd thm to dinnr.
Somtims on his way back from th antroom h would pass through th
consrvatory and pantry into th larg marbl dining hall, whr tabls
wr bing st out for ighty popl; and looking at th footmn, who
wr bringing in silvr and china, moving tabls, and unfolding damask
tabl linn, h would call Dmítri Vasílvich, a man of good family and
th managr of all his affairs, and whil looking with plasur at th
normous tabl would say: “Wll, Dmítri, you’ll s that things ar
all as thy should b? That’s right! Th grat thing is th srving,
that’s it.” And with a complacnt sigh h would rturn to th
drawing room.
“Márya Lvóvna Karágina and hr daughtr!” announcd th
countss’ gigantic footman in his bass voic, ntring th drawing
room. Th countss rflctd a momnt and took a pinch from a gold
snuffbox with hr husband’s portrait on it.
“I’m quit worn out by ths callrs. Howvr, I’ll s hr and
no mor. Sh is so affctd. Ask hr in,” sh said to th footman in a
sad voic, as if saying: “Vry wll, finish m off.”
A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-facd smiling
daughtr, ntrd th drawing room, thir drsss rustling.
“Dar Countss, what an ag... Sh has bn laid up, poor child ...
at th Razumóvski’s ball ... and Countss Apráksina ... I was
so dlightd...” cam th sounds of animatd fminin voics,
intrrupting on anothr and mingling with th rustling of drsss and
th scraping of chairs. Thn on of thos convrsations bgan which last
out until, at th first paus, th gusts ris with a rustl of drsss
and say, “I am so dlightd... Mamma’s halth... and Countss
Apráksina...” and thn, again rustling, pass into th antroom, put
on cloaks or mantls, and driv away. Th convrsation was on th chif
topic of th day: th illnss of th walthy and clbratd bau of
Cathrin’s day, Count Bzúkhov, and about his illgitimat son
Pirr, th on who had bhavd so improprly at Anna Pávlovna’s
rcption.
“I am so sorry for th poor count,” said th visitor. “H is in
such bad halth, and now this vxation about his son is nough to kill
him!”
“What is that?” askd th countss as if sh did not know what th
visitor alludd to, though sh had alrady hard about th caus of
Count Bzúkhov’s distrss som fiftn tims.
“That’s what coms of a modrn ducation,” xclaimd th visitor.
“It sms that whil h was abroad this young man was allowd to do
as h likd, now in Ptrsburg I har h has bn doing such trribl
things that h has bn xplld by th polic.”
“You don’t say so!” rplid th countss.
“H chos his frinds badly,” intrposd Anna Mikháylovna.
“Princ Vasíli’s son, h, and a crtain Dólokhov hav, it is said,
bn up to havn only knows what! And thy hav had to suffr for it.
Dólokhov has bn dgradd to th ranks and Bzúkhov’s son snt
back to Moscow. Anatol Kurágin’s fathr managd somhow to gt his
son’s affair hushd up, but vn h was ordrd out of Ptrsburg.”
“But what hav thy bn up to?” askd th countss.
“Thy ar rgular brigands, spcially Dólokhov,” rplid th
visitor. “H is a son of Márya Ivánovna Dólokhova, such a worthy
woman, but thr, just fancy! Thos thr got hold of a bar somwhr,
put it in a carriag, and st off with it to visit som actrsss! Th
polic trid to intrfr, and what did th young mn do? Thy tid
a policman and th bar back to back and put th bar into th Moyka
Canal. And thr was th bar swimming about with th policman on his
back!”
“What a nic figur th policman must hav cut, my dar!” shoutd
th count, dying with laughtr.
“Oh, how dradful! How can you laugh at it, Count?”
Yt th ladis thmslvs could not hlp laughing.
“It was all thy could do to rscu th poor man,” continud th
visitor. “And to think it is Cyril Vladímirovich Bzúkhov’s son
who amuss himslf in this snsibl mannr! And h was said to b so
wll ducatd and clvr. This is all that his forign ducation has
don for him! I hop that hr in Moscow no on will rciv him, in
spit of his mony. Thy wantd to introduc him to m, but I quit
dclind: I hav my daughtrs to considr.”
“Why do you say this young man is so rich?” askd th countss,
turning away from th girls, who at onc assumd an air of inattntion.
“His childrn ar all illgitimat. I think Pirr also is
illgitimat.”
Th visitor mad a gstur with hr hand.
“I should think h has a scor of thm.”
Princss Anna Mikháylovna intrvnd in th convrsation, vidntly
wishing to show hr connctions and knowldg of what wnt on in
socity.
“Th fact of th mattr is,” said sh significantly, and also in a
half whispr, “vryon knows Count Cyril’s rputation.... H has
lost count of his childrn, but this Pirr was his favorit.”
“How handsom th old man still was only a yar ago!” rmarkd th
countss. “I hav nvr sn a handsomr man.”
“H is vry much altrd now,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Wll, as
I was saying, Princ Vasíli is th nxt hir through his wif, but th
count is vry fond of Pirr, lookd aftr his ducation, and wrot to
th mpror about him; so that in th cas of his dath—and h is
so ill that h may di at any momnt, and Dr. Lorrain has com from
Ptrsburg—no on knows who will inhrit his immns fortun, Pirr
or Princ Vasíli. Forty thousand srfs and millions of rubls! I know
it all vry wll for Princ Vasíli told m himslf. Bsids, Cyril
Vladímirovich is my mothr’s scond cousin. H’s also my Bóry’s
godfathr,” sh addd, as if sh attachd no importanc at all to th
fact.
“Princ Vasíli arrivd in Moscow ystrday. I har h has com on
som inspction businss,” rmarkd th visitor.
“Ys, but btwn ourslvs,” said th princss, “that is a
prtxt. Th fact is h has com to s Count Cyril Vladímirovich,
haring how ill h is.”
“But do you know, my dar, that was a capital jok,” said th count;
and sing that th ldr visitor was not listning, h turnd to th
young ladis. “I can just imagin what a funny figur that policman
cut!”
And as h wavd his arms to imprsonat th policman, his portly form
again shook with a dp ringing laugh, th laugh of on who always ats
wll and, in particular, drinks wll. “So do com and din with us!”
h said.
CHAPTR XI
Silnc nsud. Th countss lookd at hr callrs, smiling affably,
but not concaling th fact that sh would not b distrssd if thy
now ros and took thir lav. Th visitor’s daughtr was alrady
smoothing down hr drss with an inquiring look at hr mothr, whn
suddnly from th nxt room wr hard th footstps of boys and girls
running to th door and th nois of a chair falling ovr, and a girl
of thirtn, hiding somthing in th folds of hr short muslin frock,
dartd in and stoppd short in th middl of th room. It was vidnt
that sh had not intndd hr flight to bring hr so far. Bhind hr in
th doorway appard a studnt with a crimson coat collar, an officr
of th Guards, a girl of fiftn, and a plump rosy-facd boy in a short
jackt.
Th count jumpd up and, swaying from sid to sid, sprad his arms wid
and thrw thm round th littl girl who had run in.
“Ah, hr sh is!” h xclaimd laughing. “My pt, whos nam day
it is. My dar pt!”
“Ma chèr, thr is a tim for vrything,” said th countss with
fignd svrity. “You spoil hr, Ilyá,” sh addd, turning to hr
husband.
“How do you do, my dar? I wish you many happy rturns of your nam
day,” said th visitor. “What a charming child,” sh addd,
addrssing th mothr.
This black-yd, wid-mouthd girl, not prtty but full of lif—with
childish bar shouldrs which aftr hr run havd and shook hr
bodic, with black curls tossd backward, thin bar arms, littl lgs
in lac-frilld drawrs, and ft in low slipprs—was just at that
charming ag whn a girl is no longr a child, though th child is not
yt a young woman. scaping from hr fathr sh ran to hid hr flushd
fac in th lac of hr mothr’s mantilla—not paying th last
attntion to hr svr rmark—and bgan to laugh. Sh laughd, and in
fragmntary sntncs trid to xplain about a doll which sh producd
from th folds of hr frock.
“Do you s?... My doll... Mimi... You s...” was all Natásha
managd to uttr (to hr vrything smd funny). Sh land against
hr mothr and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughtr that vn
th prim visitor could not hlp joining in.
“Now thn, go away and tak your monstrosity with you,” said th
mothr, pushing away hr daughtr with prtndd strnnss, and turning
to th visitor sh addd: “Sh is my youngst girl.”
Natásha, raising hr fac for a momnt from hr mothr’s mantilla,
glancd up at hr through tars of laughtr, and again hid hr fac.
Th visitor, complld to look on at this family scn, thought it
ncssary to tak som part in it.
“Tll m, my dar,” said sh to Natásha, “is Mimi a rlation of
yours? A daughtr, I suppos?”
Natásha did not lik th visitor’s ton of condscnsion to childish
things. Sh did not rply, but lookd at hr sriously.
Manwhil th youngr gnration: Borís, th officr, Anna
Mikháylovna’s son; Nicholas, th undrgraduat, th count’s ldst
son; Sónya, th count’s fiftn-yar-old nic, and littl Ptya,
his youngst boy, had all sttld down in th drawing room and wr
obviously trying to rstrain within th bounds of dcorum th xcitmnt
and mirth that shon in all thir facs. vidntly in th back rooms,
from which thy had dashd out so imptuously, th convrsation had
bn mor amusing than th drawing room talk of socity scandals, th
wathr, and Countss Apráksina. Now and thn thy glancd at on
anothr, hardly abl to supprss thir laughtr.
Th two young mn, th studnt and th officr, frinds from childhood,
wr of th sam ag and both handsom fllows, though not alik. Borís
was tall and fair, and his calm and handsom fac had rgular, dlicat
faturs. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an opn xprssion.
Dark hairs wr alrady showing on his uppr lip, and his whol fac
xprssd imptuosity and nthusiasm. Nicholas blushd whn h ntrd
th drawing room. H vidntly trid to find somthing to say, but
faild. Borís on th contrary at onc found his footing, and rlatd
quitly and humorously how h had known that doll Mimi whn sh was
still quit a young lady, bfor hr nos was brokn; how sh had agd
during th fiv yars h had known hr, and how hr had had crackd
right across th skull. Having said this h glancd at Natásha.
Sh turnd away from him and glancd at hr youngr brothr, who was
scrwing up his ys and shaking with supprssd laughtr, and unabl
to control hrslf any longr, sh jumpd up and rushd from th room as
fast as hr nimbl littl ft would carry hr. Borís did not laugh.
“You wr maning to go out, wrn’t you, Mamma? Do you want th
carriag?” h askd his mothr with a smil.
“Ys, ys, go and tll thm to gt it rady,” sh answrd,
rturning his smil.
Borís quitly lft th room and wnt in sarch of Natásha. Th plump
boy ran aftr thm angrily, as if vxd that thir program had bn
disturbd.
CHAPTR XII
Th only young popl rmaining in th drawing room, not counting th
young lady visitor and th countss’ ldst daughtr (who was four
yars oldr than hr sistr and bhavd alrady lik a grown-up prson),
wr Nicholas and Sónya, th nic. Sónya was a slndr littl
bruntt with a tndr look in hr ys which wr vild by long
lashs, thick black plaits coiling twic round hr had, and a tawny
tint in hr complxion and spcially in th color of hr slndr but
gracful and muscular arms and nck. By th grac of hr movmnts,
by th softnss and flxibility of hr small limbs, and by a crtain
coynss and rsrv of mannr, sh rmindd on of a prtty, half-grown
kittn which promiss to bcom a bautiful littl cat. Sh vidntly
considrd it propr to show an intrst in th gnral convrsation by
smiling, but in spit of hrslf hr ys undr thir thick long lashs
watchd hr cousin who was going to join th army, with such passionat
girlish adoration that hr smil could not for a singl instant impos
upon anyon, and it was clar that th kittn had sttld down only to
spring up with mor nrgy and again play with hr cousin as soon as
thy too could, lik Natásha and Borís, scap from th drawing room.
“Ah ys, my dar,” said th count, addrssing th visitor and
pointing to Nicholas, “his frind Borís has bcom an officr, and
so for frindship’s sak h is laving th univrsity and m, his
old fathr, and ntring th military srvic, my dar. And thr was a
plac and vrything waiting for him in th Archivs Dpartmnt! Isn’t
that frindship?” rmarkd th count in an inquiring ton.
“But thy say that war has bn dclard,” rplid th visitor.
“Thy’v bn saying so a long whil,” said th count, “and
thy’ll say so again and again, and that will b th nd of it. My
dar, thr’s frindship for you,” h rpatd. “H’s joining
th hussars.”
Th visitor, not knowing what to say, shook hr had.
“It’s not at all from frindship,” dclard Nicholas, flaring
up and turning away as if from a shamful asprsion. “It is not from
frindship at all; I simply fl that th army is my vocation.”
H glancd at his cousin and th young lady visitor; and thy wr both
rgarding him with a smil of approbation.
“Schubrt, th colonl of th Pávlograd Hussars, is dining with us
today. H has bn hr on lav and is taking Nicholas back with him.
It can’t b hlpd!” said th count, shrugging his shouldrs and
spaking playfully of a mattr that vidntly distrssd him.
“I hav alrady told you, Papa,” said his son, “that if you
don’t wish to lt m go, I’ll stay. But I know I am no us anywhr
xcpt in th army; I am not a diplomat or a govrnmnt clrk.—I
don’t know how to hid what I fl.” As h spok h kpt glancing
with th flirtatiousnss of a handsom youth at Sónya and th young
lady visitor.
Th littl kittn, fasting hr ys on him, smd rady at any momnt
to start hr gambols again and display hr kittnish natur.
“All right, all right!” said th old count. “H always flars up!
This Buonapart has turnd all thir hads; thy all think of how h
ros from an nsign and bcam mpror. Wll, wll, God grant it,” h
addd, not noticing his visitor’s sarcastic smil.
Th ldrs bgan talking about Bonapart. Juli Karágina turnd to
young Rostóv.
“What a pity you wrn’t at th Arkhárovs’ on Thursday. It was so
dull without you,” said sh, giving him a tndr smil.
Th young man, flattrd, sat down narr to hr with a coquttish
smil, and ngagd th smiling Juli in a confidntial convrsation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smil had stabbd th hart
of Sónya, who blushd and smild unnaturally. In th midst of his talk
h glancd round at hr. Sh gav him a passionatly angry glanc, and
hardly abl to rstrain hr tars and maintain th artificial smil
on hr lips, sh got up and lft th room. All Nicholas’ animation
vanishd. H waitd for th first paus in th convrsation, and thn
with a distrssd fac lft th room to find Sónya.
“How plainly all ths young popl war thir harts on thir
slvs!” said Anna Mikháylovna, pointing to Nicholas as h wnt out.
“Cousinag—dangrux voisinag,” * sh addd.
     * Cousinhood is a dangrous nighborhood.
“Ys,” said th countss whn th brightnss ths young popl had
brought into th room had vanishd; and as if answring a qustion no
on had put but which was always in hr mind, “and how much suffring,
how much anxity on has had to go through that w might rjoic in
thm now! And yt rally th anxity is gratr now than th joy. On is
always, always anxious! spcially just at this ag, so dangrous both
for girls and boys.”
“It all dpnds on th bringing up,” rmarkd th visitor.
“Ys, you’r quit right,” continud th countss. “Till now I
hav always, thank God, bn my childrn’s frind and had thir full
confidnc,” said sh, rpating th mistak of so many parnts who
imagin that thir childrn hav no scrts from thm. “I know I shall
always b my daughtrs’ first confidant, and that if Nicholas, with
his impulsiv natur, dos gt into mischif (a boy can’t hlp it), h
will all th sam nvr b lik thos Ptrsburg young mn.”
“Ys, thy ar splndid, splndid youngstrs,” chimd in th count,
who always solvd qustions that smd to him prplxing by dciding
that vrything was splndid. “Just fancy: wants to b an hussar.
What’s on to do, my dar?”
“What a charming cratur your youngr girl is,” said th visitor;
“a littl volcano!”
“Ys, a rgular volcano,” said th count. “Taks aftr m! And
what a voic sh has; though sh’s my daughtr, I tll th truth
whn I say sh’ll b a singr, a scond Salomoni! W hav ngagd an
Italian to giv hr lssons.”
“Isn’t sh too young? I hav hard that it harms th voic to train
it at that ag.”
“Oh no, not at all too young!” rplid th count. “Why, our
mothrs usd to b marrid at twlv or thirtn.”
“And sh’s in lov with Borís alrady. Just fancy!” said th
countss with a gntl smil, looking at Borís and wnt on, vidntly
concrnd with a thought that always occupid hr: “Now you s if I
wr to b svr with hr and to forbid it ... goodnss knows what thy
might b up to on th sly” (sh mant that thy would b kissing),
“but as it is, I know vry word sh uttrs. Sh will com running to
m of hr own accord in th vning and tll m vrything. Prhaps I
spoil hr, but rally that sms th bst plan. With hr ldr sistr I
was strictr.”
“Ys, I was brought up quit diffrntly,” rmarkd th handsom
ldr daughtr, Countss Vra, with a smil.
But th smil did not nhanc Vra’s bauty as smils gnrally do;
on th contrary it gav hr an unnatural, and thrfor unplasant,
xprssion. Vra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at
larning, was wll brought up, and had a plasant voic; what sh said
was tru and appropriat, yt, strang to say, vryon—th visitors
and countss alik—turnd to look at hr as if wondring why sh had
said it, and thy all flt awkward.
“Popl ar always too clvr with thir ldst childrn and try to
mak somthing xcptional of thm,” said th visitor.
“What’s th good of dnying it, my dar? Our dar countss was too
clvr with Vra,” said th count. “Wll, what of that? Sh’s
turnd out splndidly all th sam,” h addd, winking at Vra.
Th gusts got up and took thir lav, promising to rturn to dinnr.
“What mannrs! I thought thy would nvr go,” said th countss,
whn sh had sn hr gusts out.
CHAPTR XIII
Whn Natásha ran out of th drawing room sh only wnt as far as th
consrvatory. Thr sh pausd and stood listning to th convrsation
in th drawing room, waiting for Borís to com out. Sh was alrady
growing impatint, and stampd hr foot, rady to cry at his not coming
at onc, whn sh hard th young man’s discrt stps approaching
nithr quickly nor slowly. At this Natásha dashd swiftly among th
flowr tubs and hid thr.
Borís pausd in th middl of th room, lookd round, brushd a littl
dust from th slv of his uniform, and going up to a mirror xamind
his handsom fac. Natásha, vry still, prd out from hr ambush,
waiting to s what h would do. H stood a littl whil bfor th
glass, smild, and walkd toward th othr door. Natásha was about to
call him but changd hr mind. “Lt him look for m,” thought sh.
Hardly had Borís gon than Sónya, flushd, in tars, and muttring
angrily, cam in at th othr door. Natásha chckd hr first impuls
to run out to hr, and rmaind in hr hiding plac, watching—as
undr an invisibl cap—to s what wnt on in th world. Sh was
xprincing a nw and pculiar plasur. Sónya, muttring to hrslf,
kpt looking round toward th drawing room door. It opnd and Nicholas
cam in.
“Sónya, what is th mattr with you? How can you?” said h, running
up to hr.
“It’s nothing, nothing; lav m alon!” sobbd Sónya.
“Ah, I know what it is.”
“Wll, if you do, so much th bttr, and you can go back to hr!”
“Só-o-onya! Look hr! How can you tortur m and yourslf lik that,
for a mr fancy?” said Nicholas taking hr hand.
Sónya did not pull it away, and lft off crying. Natásha, not stirring
and scarcly brathing, watchd from hr ambush with sparkling ys.
“What will happn now?” thought sh.
“Sónya! What is anyon in th world to m? You alon ar
vrything!” said Nicholas. “And I will prov it to you.”
“I don’t lik you to talk lik that.”
“Wll, thn, I won’t; only forgiv m, Sónya!” H drw hr to him
and kissd hr.
“Oh, how nic,” thought Natásha; and whn Sónya and Nicholas had
gon out of th consrvatory sh followd and calld Borís to hr.
“Borís, com hr,” said sh with a sly and significant look. “I
hav somthing to tll you. Hr, hr!” and sh ld him into th
consrvatory to th plac among th tubs whr sh had bn hiding.
Borís followd hr, smiling.
“What is th somthing?” askd h.
Sh grw confusd, glancd round, and, sing th doll sh had thrown
down on on of th tubs, pickd it up.
“Kiss th doll,” said sh.
Borís lookd attntivly and kindly at hr agr fac, but did not
rply.
“Don’t you want to? Wll, thn, com hr,” said sh, and
wnt furthr in among th plants and thrw down th doll. “Closr,
closr!” sh whisprd.
Sh caught th young officr by his cuffs, and a look of solmnity and
far appard on hr flushd fac.
“And m? Would you lik to kiss m?” sh whisprd almost inaudibly,
glancing up at him from undr hr brows, smiling, and almost crying from
xcitmnt.
Borís blushd.
“How funny you ar!” h said, bnding down to hr and blushing still
mor, but h waitd and did nothing.
Suddnly sh jumpd up onto a tub to b highr than h, mbracd him so
that both hr slndr bar arms claspd him abov his nck, and, tossing
back hr hair, kissd him full on th lips.
Thn sh slippd down among th flowrpots on th othr sid of th tubs
and stood, hanging hr had.
“Natásha,” h said, “you know that I lov you, but....”
“You ar in lov with m?” Natásha brok in.
“Ys, I am, but plas don’t lt us do lik that.... In anothr four
yars ... thn I will ask for your hand.”
Natásha considrd.
“Thirtn, fourtn, fiftn, sixtn,” sh countd on hr slndr
littl fingrs. “All right! Thn it’s sttld?”
A smil of joy and satisfaction lit up hr agr fac.
“Sttld!” rplid Borís.
“Forvr?” said th littl girl. “Till dath itslf?”
Sh took his arm and with a happy fac wnt with him into th adjoining
sitting room.
CHAPTR XIV
Aftr rciving hr visitors, th countss was so tird that sh gav
ordrs to admit no mor, but th portr was told to b sur to invit to
dinnr all who cam “to congratulat.” Th countss wishd to hav
a têt-à-têt talk with th frind of hr childhood, Princss Anna
Mikháylovna, whom sh had not sn proprly sinc sh rturnd from
Ptrsburg. Anna Mikháylovna, with hr tar-worn but plasant fac,
drw hr chair narr to that of th countss.
“With you I will b quit frank,” said Anna Mikháylovna. “Thr
ar not many lft of us old frinds! That’s why I so valu your
frindship.”
Anna Mikháylovna lookd at Vra and pausd. Th countss prssd hr
frind’s hand.
“Vra,” sh said to hr ldst daughtr who was vidntly not a
favorit, “how is it you hav so littl tact? Don’t you s you ar
not wantd hr? Go to th othr girls, or...”
Th handsom Vra smild contmptuously but did not sm at all hurt.
“If you had told m soonr, Mamma, I would hav gon,” sh rplid
as sh ros to go to hr own room.
But as sh passd th sitting room sh noticd two coupls sitting,
on pair at ach window. Sh stoppd and smild scornfully. Sónya was
sitting clos to Nicholas who was copying out som vrss for hr, th
first h had vr writtn. Borís and Natásha wr at th othr window
and casd talking whn Vra ntrd. Sónya and Natásha lookd at
Vra with guilty, happy facs.
It was plasant and touching to s ths littl girls in lov; but
apparntly th sight of thm rousd no plasant fling in Vra.
“How oftn hav I askd you not to tak my things?” sh said. “You
hav a room of your own,” and sh took th inkstand from Nicholas.
“In a minut, in a minut,” h said, dipping his pn.
“You always manag to do things at th wrong tim,” continud Vra.
“You cam rushing into th drawing room so that vryon flt ashamd
of you.”
Though what sh said was quit just, prhaps for that vry rason no on
rplid, and th four simply lookd at on anothr. Sh lingrd in th
room with th inkstand in hr hand.
“And at your ag what scrts can thr b btwn Natásha and
Borís, or btwn you two? It’s all nonsns!”
“Now, Vra, what dos it mattr to you?” said Natásha in dfns,
spaking vry gntly.
Sh smd that day to b mor than vr kind and affctionat to
vryon.
“Vry silly,” said Vra. “I am ashamd of you. Scrts indd!”
“All hav scrts of thir own,” answrd Natásha, gtting warmr.
“W don’t intrfr with you and Brg.”
“I should think not,” said Vra, “bcaus thr can nvr b
anything wrong in my bhavior. But I’ll just tll Mamma how you ar
bhaving with Borís.”
“Natálya Ilyníchna bhavs vry wll to m,” rmarkd Borís. “I
hav nothing to complain of.”
“Don’t, Borís! You ar such a diplomat that it is rally
tirsom,” said Natásha in a mortifid voic that trmbld slightly.
(Sh usd th word “diplomat,” which was just thn much in vogu
among th childrn, in th spcial sns thy attachd to it.) “Why
dos sh bothr m?” And sh addd, turning to Vra, “You’ll
nvr undrstand it, bcaus you’v nvr lovd anyon. You hav no
hart! You ar a Madam d Gnlis and nothing mor” (this nicknam,
bstowd on Vra by Nicholas, was considrd vry stinging), “and
your gratst plasur is to b unplasant to popl! Go and flirt with
Brg as much as you plas,” sh finishd quickly.
“I shall at any rat not run aftr a young man bfor visitors...”
“Wll, now you’v don what you wantd,” put in Nicholas—“said
unplasant things to vryon and upst thm. Lt’s go to th
nursry.”
All four, lik a flock of scard birds, got up and lft th room.
“Th unplasant things wr said to m,” rmarkd Vra, “I said
non to anyon.”
“Madam d Gnlis! Madam d Gnlis!” shoutd laughing voics
through th door.
Th handsom Vra, who producd such an irritating and unplasant
ffct on vryon, smild and, vidntly unmovd by what had bn
said to hr, wnt to th looking glass and arrangd hr hair and scarf.
Looking at hr own handsom fac sh smd to bcom still coldr and
calmr.
In th drawing room th convrsation was still going on.
“Ah, my dar,” said th countss, “my lif is not all ross
ithr. Don’t I know that at th rat w ar living our mans won’t
last long? It’s all th Club and his asygoing natur. vn in th
country do w gt any rst? Thatricals, hunting, and havn knows what
bsids! But don’t lt’s talk about m; tll m how you managd
vrything. I oftn wondr at you, Anntt—how at your ag you
can rush off alon in a carriag to Moscow, to Ptrsburg, to thos
ministrs and grat popl, and know how to dal with thm all! It’s
quit astonishing. How did you gt things sttld? I couldn’t possibly
do it.”
“Ah, my lov,” answrd Anna Mikháylovna, “God grant you nvr
know what it is to b lft a widow without mans and with a son you lov
to distraction! On larns many things thn,” sh addd with a crtain
prid. “That lawsuit taught m much. Whn I want to s on of thos
big popl I writ a not: ‘Princss So-and-So dsirs an intrviw
with So and-So,’ and thn I tak a cab and go myslf two, thr, or
four tims—till I gt what I want. I don’t mind what thy think of
m.”
“Wll, and to whom did you apply about Bóry?” askd th countss.
“You s yours is alrady an officr in th Guards, whil my Nicholas
is going as a cadt. Thr’s no on to intrst himslf for him. To
whom did you apply?”
“To Princ Vasíli. H was so kind. H at onc agrd to vrything,
and put th mattr bfor th mpror,” said Princss Anna
Mikháylovna nthusiastically, quit forgtting all th humiliation sh
had ndurd to gain hr nd.
“Has Princ Vasíli agd much?” askd th countss. “I hav not
sn him sinc w actd togthr at th Rumyántsovs’ thatricals. I
xpct h has forgottn m. H paid m attntions in thos days,” said
th countss, with a smil.
“H is just th sam as vr,” rplid Anna Mikháylovna,
“ovrflowing with amiability. His position has not turnd his had
at all. H said to m, ‘I am sorry I can do so littl for you, dar
Princss. I am at your command.’ Ys, h is a fin fllow and a vry
kind rlation. But, Nataly, you know my lov for my son: I would do
anything for his happinss! And my affairs ar in such a bad way that my
position is now a trribl on,” continud Anna Mikháylovna, sadly,
dropping hr voic. “My wrtchd lawsuit taks all I hav and maks no
progrss. Would you bliv it, I hav litrally not a pnny and don’t
know how to quip Borís.” Sh took out hr handkrchif and bgan to
cry. “I nd fiv hundrd rubls, and hav only on twnty-fiv-rubl
not. I am in such a stat.... My only hop now is in Count Cyril
Vladímirovich Bzúkhov. If h will not assist his godson—you know
h is Bóry’s godfathr—and allow him somthing for his maintnanc,
all my troubl will hav bn thrown away.... I shall not b abl to
quip him.”
Th countss’ ys filld with tars and sh pondrd in silnc.
“I oftn think, though, prhaps it’s a sin,” said th princss,
“that hr livs Count Cyril Vladímirovich Bzúkhov so rich, all
alon... that trmndous fortun... and what is his lif worth? It’s a
burdn to him, and Bóry’s lif is only just bginning....”
“Surly h will lav somthing to Borís,” said th countss.
“Havn only knows, my dar! Ths rich grands ar so slfish.
Still, I will tak Borís and go to s him at onc, and I shall spak
to him straight out. Lt popl think what thy will of m, it’s
rally all th sam to m whn my son’s fat is at stak.” Th
princss ros. “It’s now two o’clock and you din at four. Thr
will just b tim.”
And lik a practical Ptrsburg lady who knows how to mak th most of
tim, Anna Mikháylovna snt somon to call hr son, and wnt into th
antroom with him.
“Good-by, my dar,” said sh to th countss who saw hr to th
door, and addd in a whispr so that hr son should not har, “Wish m
good luck.”
“Ar you going to Count Cyril Vladímirovich, my dar?” said th
count coming out from th dining hall into th antroom, and h addd:
“If h is bttr, ask Pirr to din with us. H has bn to th
hous, you know, and dancd with th childrn. B sur to invit him, my
dar. W will s how Tarás distinguishs himslf today. H says Count
Orlóv nvr gav such a dinnr as ours will b!”
CHAPTR XV
“My dar Borís,” said Princss Anna Mikháylovna to hr son as
Countss Rostóva’s carriag in which thy wr satd drov ovr th
straw covrd strt and turnd into th wid courtyard of Count Cyril
Vladímirovich Bzúkhov’s hous. “My dar Borís,” said th
mothr, drawing hr hand from bnath hr old mantl and laying
it timidly and tndrly on hr son’s arm, “b affctionat and
attntiv to him. Count Cyril Vladímirovich is your godfathr aftr
all, and your futur dpnds on him. Rmmbr that, my dar, and b nic
to him, as you so wll know how to b.”
“If only I knw that anything bsids humiliation would com of
it...” answrd hr son coldly. “But I hav promisd and will do it
for your sak.”
Although th hall portr saw somon’s carriag standing at th
ntranc, aftr scrutinizing th mothr and son (who without asking to
b announcd had passd straight through th glass porch btwn th
rows of status in nichs) and looking significantly at th lady’s old
cloak, h askd whthr thy wantd th count or th princsss, and,
haring that thy wishd to s th count, said his xcllncy was wors
today, and that his xcllncy was not rciving anyon.
“W may as wll go back,” said th son in Frnch.
“My dar!” xclaimd his mothr imploringly, again laying hr hand
on his arm as if that touch might sooth or rous him.
Borís said no mor, but lookd inquiringly at his mothr without taking
off his cloak.
“My frind,” said Anna Mikháylovna in gntl tons, addrssing
th hall portr, “I know Count Cyril Vladímirovich is vry ill...
that’s why I hav com... I am a rlation. I shall not disturb him,
my frind... I only nd s Princ Vasíli Srgvich: h is staying
hr, is h not? Plas announc m.”
Th hall portr sullnly pulld a bll that rang upstairs, and turnd
away.
“Princss Drubtskáya to s Princ Vasíli Srgvich,” h calld
to a footman drssd in kn brchs, shos, and a swallow-tail coat,
who ran downstairs and lookd ovr from th halfway landing.
Th mothr smoothd th folds of hr dyd silk drss bfor a larg
Vntian mirror in th wall, and in hr troddn-down shos briskly
ascndd th carptd stairs.
“My dar,” sh said to hr son, onc mor stimulating him by a
touch, “you promisd m!”
Th son, lowring his ys, followd hr quitly.
Thy ntrd th larg hall, from which on of th doors ld to th
apartmnts assignd to Princ Vasíli.
Just as th mothr and son, having rachd th middl of th hall, wr
about to ask thir way of an ldrly footman who had sprung up as thy
ntrd, th bronz handl of on of th doors turnd and Princ Vasíli
cam out—waring a vlvt coat with a singl star on his brast,
as was his custom whn at hom—taking lav of a good-looking,
dark-haird man. This was th clbratd Ptrsburg doctor, Lorrain.
“Thn it is crtain?” said th princ.
“Princ, humanum st rrar, * but...” rplid th doctor,
swallowing his r’s, and pronouncing th Latin words with a Frnch
accnt.
     * To rr is human.
“Vry wll, vry wll...”
Sing Anna Mikháylovna and hr son, Princ Vasíli dismissd th
doctor with a bow and approachd thm silntly and with a look of
inquiry. Th son noticd that an xprssion of profound sorrow suddnly
cloudd his mothr’s fac, and h smild slightly.
“Ah, Princ! In what sad circumstancs w mt again! And how is our
dar invalid?” said sh, as though unawar of th cold offnsiv look
fixd on hr.
Princ Vasíli stard at hr and at Borís qustioningly and prplxd.
Borís bowd politly. Princ Vasíli without acknowldging th bow
turnd to Anna Mikháylovna, answring hr qury by a movmnt of th
had and lips indicating vry littl hop for th patint.
“Is it possibl?” xclaimd Anna Mikháylovna. “Oh, how awful!
It is trribl to think.... This is my son,” sh addd, indicating
Borís. “H wantd to thank you himslf.”
Borís bowd again politly.
“Bliv m, Princ, a mothr’s hart will nvr forgt what you
hav don for us.”
“I am glad I was abl to do you a srvic, my dar Anna
Mikháylovna,” said Princ Vasíli, arranging his lac frill, and in
ton and mannr, hr in Moscow to Anna Mikháylovna whom h had placd
undr an obligation, assuming an air of much gratr importanc than h
had don in Ptrsburg at Anna Schrr’s rcption.
“Try to srv wll and show yourslf worthy,” addd h, addrssing
Borís with svrity. “I am glad.... Ar you hr on lav?” h wnt
on in his usual ton of indiffrnc.
“I am awaiting ordrs to join my nw rgimnt, your xcllncy,”
rplid Borís, btraying nithr annoyanc at th princ’s brusqu
mannr nor a dsir to ntr into convrsation, but spaking so quitly
and rspctfully that th princ gav him a sarching glanc.
“Ar you living with your mothr?”
“I am living at Countss Rostóva’s,” rplid Borís, again
adding, “your xcllncy.”
“That is, with Ilyá Rostóv who marrid Nataly Shinshiná,” said
Anna Mikháylovna.
“I know, I know,” answrd Princ Vasíli in his monotonous voic.
“I nvr could undrstand how Nataly mad up hr mind to marry that
unlickd bar! A prfctly absurd and stupid fllow, and a gamblr too,
I am told.”
“But a vry kind man, Princ,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a
pathtic smil, as though sh too knw that Count Rostóv dsrvd this
cnsur, but askd him not to b too hard on th poor old man. “What
do th doctors say?” askd th princss aftr a paus, hr worn fac
again xprssing dp sorrow.
“Thy giv littl hop,” rplid th princ.
“And I should so lik to thank Uncl onc for all his kindnss to m
and Borís. H is his godson,” sh addd, hr ton suggsting that
this fact ought to giv Princ Vasíli much satisfaction.
Princ Vasíli bcam thoughtful and frownd. Anna Mikháylovna saw that
h was afraid of finding in hr a rival for Count Bzúkhov’s fortun,
and hastnd to rassur him.
“If it wr not for my sincr affction and dvotion to Uncl,”
said sh, uttring th word with pculiar assuranc and unconcrn, “I
know his charactr: nobl, upright ... but you s h has no on with
him xcpt th young princsss.... Thy ar still young....” Sh bnt
hr had and continud in a whispr: “Has h prformd his final duty,
Princ? How priclss ar thos last momnts! It can mak things no
wors, and it is absolutly ncssary to prpar him if h is so ill.
W womn, Princ,” and sh smild tndrly, “always know how to say
ths things. I absolutly must s him, howvr painful it may b for
m. I am usd to suffring.”
vidntly th princ undrstood hr, and also undrstood, as h had don
at Anna Pávlovna’s, that it would b difficult to gt rid of Anna
Mikháylovna.
“Would not such a mting b too trying for him, dar Anna
Mikháylovna?” said h. “Lt us wait until vning. Th doctors ar
xpcting a crisis.”
“But on cannot dlay, Princ, at such a momnt! Considr that th
wlfar of his soul is at stak. Ah, it is awful: th dutis of a
Christian...”
A door of on of th innr rooms opnd and on of th princsss, th
count’s nic, ntrd with a cold, strn fac. Th lngth of hr
body was strikingly out of proportion to hr short lgs. Princ Vasíli
turnd to hr.
“Wll, how is h?”
“Still th sam; but what can you xpct, this nois...” said th
princss, looking at Anna Mikháylovna as at a strangr.
“Ah, my dar, I hardly knw you,” said Anna Mikháylovna with a
happy smil, ambling lightly up to th count’s nic. “I hav com,
and am at your srvic to hlp you nurs my uncl. I imagin what you
hav gon through,” and sh sympathtically turnd up hr ys.
Th princss gav no rply and did not vn smil, but lft th room as
Anna Mikháylovna took off hr glovs and, occupying th position sh
had conqurd, sttld down in an armchair, inviting Princ Vasíli to
tak a sat bsid hr.
“Borís,” sh said to hr son with a smil, “I shall go in to s
th count, my uncl; but you, my dar, had bttr go to Pirr manwhil
and don’t forgt to giv him th Rostóvs’ invitation. Thy ask him
to dinnr. I suppos h won’t go?” sh continud, turning to th
princ.
“On th contrary,” rplid th princ, who had plainly bcom
dprssd, “I shall b only too glad if you rliv m of that young
man.... Hr h is, and th count has not onc askd for him.”
H shruggd his shouldrs. A footman conductd Borís down on flight of
stairs and up anothr, to Pirr’s rooms.
CHAPTR XVI
Pirr, aftr all, had not managd to choos a carr for himslf in
Ptrsburg, and had bn xplld from thr for riotous conduct and
snt to Moscow. Th story told about him at Count Rostóv’s was tru.
Pirr had takn part in tying a policman to a bar. H had now bn
for som days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fathr’s
hous. Though h xpctd that th story of his scapad would b
alrady known in Moscow and that th ladis about his fathr—who wr
nvr favorably disposd toward him—would hav usd it to turn th
count against him, h nvrthlss on th day of his arrival wnt to
his fathr’s part of th hous. ntring th drawing room, whr th
princsss spnt most of thir tim, h grtd th ladis, two of whom
wr sitting at mbroidry frams whil a third rad aloud. It was th
ldst who was rading—th on who had mt Anna Mikháylovna. Th
two youngr ons wr mbroidring: both wr rosy and prtty and thy
diffrd only in that on had a littl mol on hr lip which mad hr
much prttir. Pirr was rcivd as if h wr a corps or a lpr.
Th ldst princss pausd in hr rading and silntly stard at him
with frightnd ys; th scond assumd prcisly th sam xprssion;
whil th youngst, th on with th mol, who was of a chrful and
livly disposition, bnt ovr hr fram to hid a smil probably vokd
by th amusing scn sh forsaw. Sh drw hr wool down through th
canvas and, scarcly abl to rfrain from laughing, stoopd as if trying
to mak out th pattrn.
“How do you do, cousin?” said Pirr. “You don’t rcogniz
m?”
“I rcogniz you only too wll, too wll.”
“How is th count? Can I s him?” askd Pirr, awkwardly as usual,
but unabashd.
“Th count is suffring physically and mntally, and apparntly you
hav don your bst to incras his mntal suffrings.”
“Can I s th count?” Pirr again askd.
“Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can s
him... Olga, go and s whthr Uncl’s bf ta is rady—it is
almost tim,” sh addd, giving Pirr to undrstand that thy wr
busy, and busy making his fathr comfortabl, whil vidntly h,
Pirr, was only busy causing him annoyanc.
Olga wnt out. Pirr stood looking at th sistrs; thn h bowd and
said: “Thn I will go to my rooms. You will lt m know whn I can s
him.”
And h lft th room, followd by th low but ringing laughtr of th
sistr with th mol.
Nxt day Princ Vasíli had arrivd and sttld in th count’s hous.
H snt for Pirr and said to him: “My dar fllow, if you ar going
to bhav hr as you did in Ptrsburg, you will nd vry badly; that
is all I hav to say to you. Th count is vry, vry ill, and you must
not s him at all.”
Sinc thn Pirr had not bn disturbd and had spnt th whol tim in
his rooms upstairs.
Whn Borís appard at his door Pirr was pacing up and down his room,
stopping occasionally at a cornr to mak mnacing gsturs at th wall,
as if running a sword through an invisibl fo, and glaring savagly
ovr his spctacls, and thn again rsuming his walk, muttring
indistinct words, shrugging his shouldrs and gsticulating.
“ngland is don for,” said h, scowling and pointing his fingr
at somon unsn. “Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to th nation and to th
rights of man, is sntncd to...” But bfor Pirr—who at that
momnt imagind himslf to b Napolon in prson and to hav just
ffctd th dangrous crossing of th Straits of Dovr and capturd
London—could pronounc Pitt’s sntnc, h saw a wll-built and
handsom young officr ntring his room. Pirr pausd. H had lft
Moscow whn Borís was a boy of fourtn, and had quit forgottn him,
but in his usual impulsiv and harty way h took Borís by th hand
with a frindly smil.
“Do you rmmbr m?” askd Borís quitly with a plasant smil.
“I hav com with my mothr to s th count, but it sms h is not
wll.”
“Ys, it sms h is ill. Popl ar always disturbing him,”
answrd Pirr, trying to rmmbr who this young man was.
Borís flt that Pirr did not rcogniz him but did not considr
it ncssary to introduc himslf, and without xprincing th last
mbarrassmnt lookd Pirr straight in th fac.
“Count Rostóv asks you to com to dinnr today,” said h, aftr a
considrabl paus which mad Pirr fl uncomfortabl.
“Ah, Count Rostóv!” xclaimd Pirr joyfully. “Thn you ar his
son, Ilyá? Only fancy, I didn’t know you at first. Do you rmmbr
how w wnt to th Sparrow Hills with Madam Jacquot?... It’s such an
ag...”
“You ar mistakn,” said Borís dlibratly, with a bold and
slightly sarcastic smil. “I am Borís, son of Princss Anna
Mikháylovna Drubtskáya. Rostóv, th fathr, is Ilyá, and his son is
Nicholas. I nvr knw any Madam Jacquot.”
Pirr shook his had and arms as if attackd by mosquitos or bs.
“Oh dar, what am I thinking about? I’v mixd vrything up. On
has so many rlativs in Moscow! So you ar Borís? Of cours. Wll, now
w know whr w ar. And what do you think of th Boulogn xpdition?
Th nglish will com off badly, you know, if Napolon gts across th
Channl. I think th xpdition is quit fasibl. If only Villnuv
dosn’t mak a mss of things!”
Borís knw nothing about th Boulogn xpdition; h did not rad th
paprs and it was th first tim h had hard Villnuv’s nam.
“W hr in Moscow ar mor occupid with dinnr partis and scandal
than with politics,” said h in his quit ironical ton. “I know
nothing about it and hav not thought about it. Moscow is chifly busy
with gossip,” h continud. “Just now thy ar talking about you and
your fathr.”
Pirr smild in his good-naturd way as if afraid for his companion’s
sak that th lattr might say somthing h would aftrwards rgrt.
But Borís spok distinctly, clarly, and dryly, looking straight into
Pirr’s ys.
“Moscow has nothing ls to do but gossip,” Borís wnt on.
“vrybody is wondring to whom th count will lav his fortun,
though h may prhaps outliv us all, as I sincrly hop h will...”
“Ys, it is all vry horrid,” intrruptd Pirr, “vry horrid.”
Pirr was still afraid that this officr might inadvrtntly say
somthing disconcrting to himslf.
“And it must sm to you,” said Borís flushing slightly, but not
changing his ton or attitud, “it must sm to you that vryon is
trying to gt somthing out of th rich man?”
“So it dos,” thought Pirr.
“But I just wish to say, to avoid misundrstandings, that you ar
quit mistakn if you rckon m or my mothr among such popl. W ar
vry poor, but for my own part at any rat, for th vry rason that
your fathr is rich, I don’t rgard myslf as a rlation of his, and
nithr I nor my mothr would vr ask or tak anything from him.”
For a long tim Pirr could not undrstand, but whn h did, h jumpd
up from th sofa, sizd Borís undr th lbow in his quick, clumsy
way, and, blushing far mor than Borís, bgan to spak with a fling
of mingld sham and vxation.
“Wll, this is strang! Do you suppos I... who could think?... I know
vry wll...”
But Borís again intrruptd him.
“I am glad I hav spokn out fully. Prhaps you did not lik it? You
must xcus m,” said h, putting Pirr at as instad of bing put
at as by him, “but I hop I hav not offndd you. I always mak it
a rul to spak out... Wll, what answr am I to tak? Will you com to
dinnr at th Rostóvs’?”
And Borís, having apparntly rlivd himslf of an onrous duty and
xtricatd himslf from an awkward situation and placd anothr in it,
bcam quit plasant again.
“No, but I say,” said Pirr, calming down, “you ar a wondrful
fllow! What you hav just said is good, vry good. Of cours you
don’t know m. W hav not mt for such a long tim... not sinc w
wr childrn. You might think that I... I undrstand, quit undrstand.
I could not hav don it myslf, I should not hav had th courag, but
it’s splndid. I am vry glad to hav mad your acquaintanc. It’s
qur,” h addd aftr a paus, “that you should hav suspctd
m!” H bgan to laugh. “Wll, what of it! I hop w’ll gt bttr
acquaintd,” and h prssd Borís’ hand. “Do you know, I hav not
onc bn in to s th count. H has not snt for m.... I am sorry for
him as a man, but what can on do?”
“And so you think Napolon will manag to gt an army across?” askd
Borís with a smil.
Pirr saw that Borís wishd to chang th subjct, and bing of th
sam mind h bgan xplaining th advantags and disadvantags of th
Boulogn xpdition.
A footman cam in to summon Borís—th princss was going. Pirr, in
ordr to mak Borís’ bttr acquaintanc, promisd to com to dinnr,
and warmly prssing his hand lookd affctionatly ovr his spctacls
into Borís’ ys. Aftr h had gon Pirr continud pacing up and
down th room for a long tim, no longr pircing an imaginary fo with
his imaginary sword, but smiling at th rmmbranc of that plasant,
intllignt, and rsolut young man.
As oftn happns in arly youth, spcially to on who lads a lonly
lif, h flt an unaccountabl tndrnss for this young man and mad up
his mind that thy would b frinds.
Princ Vasíli saw th princss off. Sh hld a handkrchif to hr ys
and hr fac was tarful.
“It is dradful, dradful!” sh was saying, “but cost m what it
may I shall do my duty. I will com and spnd th night. H must not b
lft lik this. vry momnt is prcious. I can’t think why his nics
put it off. Prhaps God will hlp m to find a way to prpar him!...
Adiu, Princ! May God support you...”
“Adiu, ma bonn,” answrd Princ Vasíli turning away from hr.
“Oh, h is in a dradful stat,” said th mothr to hr son whn
thy wr in th carriag. “H hardly rcognizs anybody.”
“I don’t undrstand, Mamma—what is his attitud to Pirr?”
askd th son.
“Th will will show that, my dar; our fat also dpnds on it.”
“But why do you xpct that h will lav us anything?”
“Ah, my dar! H is so rich, and w ar so poor!”
“Wll, that is hardly a sufficint rason, Mamma...”
“Oh, Havn! How ill h is!” xclaimd th mothr.
CHAPTR XVII
Aftr Anna Mikháylovna had drivn off with hr son to visit Count Cyril
Vladímirovich Bzúkhov, Countss Rostóva sat for a long tim all
alon applying hr handkrchif to hr ys. At last sh rang.
“What is th mattr with you, my dar?” sh said crossly to th maid
who kpt hr waiting som minuts. “Don’t you wish to srv m? Thn
I’ll find you anothr plac.”
Th countss was upst by hr frind’s sorrow and humiliating povrty,
and was thrfor out of sorts, a stat of mind which with hr always
found xprssion in calling hr maid “my dar” and spaking to hr
with xaggratd politnss.
“I am vry sorry, ma’am,” answrd th maid.
“Ask th count to com to m.”
Th count cam waddling in to s his wif with a rathr guilty look as
usual.
“Wll, littl countss? What a saut of gam au madèr w ar to
hav, my dar! I tastd it. Th thousand rubls I paid for Tarás wr
not ill-spnt. H is worth it!”
H sat down by his wif, his lbows on his kns and his hands ruffling
his gray hair.
“What ar your commands, littl countss?”
“You s, my dar... What’s that mss?” sh said, pointing to his
waistcoat. “It’s th saut, most likly,” sh addd with a smil.
“Wll, you s, Count, I want som mony.”
Hr fac bcam sad.
“Oh, littl countss!” ... and th count bgan bustling to gt out
his pocktbook.
“I want a grat dal, Count! I want fiv hundrd rubls,” and taking
out hr cambric handkrchif sh bgan wiping hr husband’s waistcoat.
“Ys, immdiatly, immdiatly! Hy, who’s thr?” h calld out
in a ton only usd by prsons who ar crtain that thos thy call will
rush to oby th summons. “Snd Dmítri to m!”
Dmítri, a man of good family who had bn brought up in th count’s
hous and now managd all his affairs, stppd softly into th room.
“This is what I want, my dar fllow,” said th count to th
dfrntial young man who had ntrd. “Bring m...” h rflctd
a momnt, “ys, bring m svn hundrd rubls, ys! But mind, don’t
bring m such tattrd and dirty nots as last tim, but nic clan ons
for th countss.”
“Ys, Dmítri, clan ons, plas,” said th countss, sighing
dply.
“Whn would you lik thm, your xcllncy?” askd Dmítri. “Allow
m to inform you... But, don’t b unasy,” h addd, noticing that
th count was bginning to brath havily and quickly which was always
a sign of approaching angr. “I was forgtting... Do you wish it
brought at onc?”
“Ys, ys; just so! Bring it. Giv it to th countss.”
“What a trasur that Dmítri is,” addd th count with a smil whn
th young man had dpartd. “Thr is nvr any ‘impossibl’ with
him. That’s a thing I hat! vrything is possibl.”
“Ah, mony, Count, mony! How much sorrow it causs in th world,”
said th countss. “But I am in grat nd of this sum.”
“You, my littl countss, ar a notorious spndthrift,” said th
count, and having kissd his wif’s hand h wnt back to his study.
Whn Anna Mikháylovna rturnd from Count Bzúkhov’s th mony, all
in clan nots, was lying rady undr a handkrchif on th countss’
littl tabl, and Anna Mikháylovna noticd that somthing was agitating
hr.
“Wll, my dar?” askd th countss.
“Oh, what a trribl stat h is in! On would not know him, h is so
ill! I was only thr a fw momnts and hardly said a word...”
“Anntt, for havn’s sak don’t rfus m,” th countss
bgan, with a blush that lookd vry strang on hr thin, dignifid,
ldrly fac, and sh took th mony from undr th handkrchif.
Anna Mikháylovna instantly gussd hr intntion and stoopd to b
rady to mbrac th countss at th appropriat momnt.
“This is for Borís from m, for his outfit.”
Anna Mikháylovna was alrady mbracing hr and wping. Th countss
wpt too. Thy wpt bcaus thy wr frinds, and bcaus thy wr
kindhartd, and bcaus thy—frinds from childhood—had to think
about such a bas thing as mony, and bcaus thir youth was ovr....
But thos tars wr plasant to thm both.
CHAPTR XVIII
Countss Rostóva, with hr daughtrs and a larg numbr of gusts, was
alrady satd in th drawing room. Th count took th gntlmn into
his study and showd thm his choic collction of Turkish pips. From
tim to tim h wnt out to ask: “Hasn’t sh com yt?” Thy
wr xpcting Márya Dmítrivna Akhrosímova, known in socity as l
trribl dragon, a lady distinguishd not for walth or rank, but for
common sns and frank plainnss of spch. Márya Dmítrivna was known
to th Imprial family as wll as to all Moscow and Ptrsburg, and both
citis wondrd at hr, laughd privatly at hr rudnsss, and told
good storis about hr, whil non th lss all without xcption
rspctd and fard hr.
In th count’s room, which was full of tobacco smok, thy talkd
of th war that had bn announcd in a manifsto, and about th
rcruiting. Non of thm had yt sn th manifsto, but thy all knw
it had appard. Th count sat on th sofa btwn two gusts who wr
smoking and talking. H nithr smokd nor talkd, but bnding his had
first to on sid and thn to th othr watchd th smokrs with vidnt
plasur and listnd to th convrsation of his two nighbors, whom h
ggd on against ach othr.
On of thm was a sallow, clan-shavn civilian with a thin and wrinkld
fac, alrady growing old, though h was drssd lik a most fashionabl
young man. H sat with his lgs up on th sofa as if quit at hom and,
having stuck an ambr mouthpic far into his mouth, was inhaling th
smok spasmodically and scrwing up his ys. This was an old bachlor,
Shinshín, a cousin of th countss’, a man with “a sharp tongu”
as thy said in Moscow socity. H smd to b condscnding to
his companion. Th lattr, a frsh, rosy officr of th Guards,
irrproachably washd, brushd, and buttond, hld his pip in th
middl of his mouth and with rd lips gntly inhald th smok, ltting
it scap from his handsom mouth in rings. This was Liutnant Brg, an
officr in th Smënov rgimnt with whom Borís was to travl to join
th army, and about whom Natásha had tasd hr ldr sistr Vra,
spaking of Brg as hr “intndd.” Th count sat btwn thm and
listnd attntivly. His favorit occupation whn not playing boston, a
card gam h was vry fond of, was that of listnr, spcially whn h
succdd in stting two loquacious talkrs at on anothr.
“Wll, thn, old chap, mon très honorabl Alphons Kárlovich,”
said Shinshín, laughing ironically and mixing th most ordinary Russian
xprssions with th choicst Frnch phrass—which was a pculiarity
of his spch. “Vous comptz vous fair ds rnts sur l’tat; *
you want to mak somthing out of your company?”
     * You xpct to mak an incom out of th govrnmnt.
“No, Ptr Nikolávich; I only want to show that in th cavalry
th advantags ar far lss than in th infantry. Just considr my own
position now, Ptr Nikolávich...”
Brg always spok quitly, politly, and with grat prcision. His
convrsation always rlatd ntirly to himslf; h would rmain calm
and silnt whn th talk rlatd to any topic that had no dirct baring
on himslf. H could rmain silnt for hours without bing at all put
out of countnanc himslf or making othrs uncomfortabl, but as
soon as th convrsation concrnd himslf h would bgin to talk
circumstantially and with vidnt satisfaction.
“Considr my position, Ptr Nikolávich. Wr I in th cavalry I
should gt not mor than two hundrd rubls vry four months, vn
with th rank of liutnant; but as it is I rciv two hundrd and
thirty,” said h, looking at Shinshín and th count with a joyful,
plasant smil, as if it wr obvious to him that his succss must
always b th chif dsir of vryon ls.
“Bsids that, Ptr Nikolávich, by xchanging into th Guards
I shall b in a mor prominnt position,” continud Brg, “and
vacancis occur much mor frquntly in th Foot Guards. Thn just think
what can b don with two hundrd and thirty rubls! I vn manag to
put a littl asid and to snd somthing to my fathr,” h wnt on,
mitting a smok ring.
“La balanc y st... * A Grman knows how to skin a flint, as th
provrb says,” rmarkd Shinshín, moving his pip to th othr sid
of his mouth and winking at th count.
      * So that squars mattrs.
Th count burst out laughing. Th othr gusts sing that Shinshín
was talking cam up to listn. Brg, oblivious of irony or indiffrnc,
continud to xplain how by xchanging into th Guards h had alrady
gaind a stp on his old comrads of th Cadt Corps; how in wartim
th company commandr might gt killd and h, as snior in th company,
might asily succd to th post; how popular h was with vryon in
th rgimnt, and how satisfid his fathr was with him. Brg vidntly
njoyd narrating all this, and did not sm to suspct that othrs,
too, might hav thir own intrsts. But all h said was so prttily
sdat, and th naïvt of his youthful gotism was so obvious, that
h disarmd his harrs.
“Wll, my boy, you’ll gt along whrvr you go—foot or
hors—that I’ll warrant,” said Shinshín, patting him on th
shouldr and taking his ft off th sofa.
Brg smild joyously. Th count, followd by his gusts, wnt into th
drawing room.
It was just th momnt bfor a big dinnr whn th assmbld gusts,
xpcting th summons to zakúska, * avoid ngaging in any long
convrsation but think it ncssary to mov about and talk, in ordr
to show that thy ar not at all impatint for thir food. Th host and
hostss look toward th door, and now and thn glanc at on anothr,
and th visitors try to guss from ths glancs who, or what, thy ar
waiting for—som important rlation who has not yt arrivd, or a dish
that is not yt rady.
     * Hors d’ouvrs.
Pirr had com just at dinnrtim and was sitting awkwardly in th
middl of th drawing room on th first chair h had com across,
blocking th way for vryon. Th countss trid to mak him talk,
but h wnt on naïvly looking around through his spctacls as if in
sarch of sombody and answrd all hr qustions in monosyllabls. H
was in th way and was th only on who did not notic th fact. Most of
th gusts, knowing of th affair with th bar, lookd with curiosity
at this big, stout, quit man, wondring how such a clumsy, modst
fllow could hav playd such a prank on a policman.
“You hav only latly arrivd?” th countss askd him.
“Oui, madam,” rplid h, looking around him.
“You hav not yt sn my husband?”
“Non, madam.” H smild quit inappropriatly.
“You hav bn in Paris rcntly, I bliv? I suppos it’s vry
intrsting.”
“Vry intrsting.”
Th countss xchangd glancs with Anna Mikháylovna. Th lattr
undrstood that sh was bing askd to ntrtain this young man, and
sitting down bsid him sh bgan to spak about his fathr; but h
answrd hr, as h had th countss, only in monosyllabls. Th othr
gusts wr all convrsing with on anothr. “Th Razumóvskis... It
was charming... You ar vry kind... Countss Apráksina...” was hard
on all sids. Th countss ros and wnt into th ballroom.
“Márya Dmítrivna?” cam hr voic from thr.
“Hrslf,” cam th answr in a rough voic, and Márya Dmítrivna
ntrd th room.
All th unmarrid ladis and vn th marrid ons xcpt th vry
oldst ros. Márya Dmítrivna pausd at th door. Tall and stout,
holding high hr fifty-yar-old had with its gray curls, sh stood
survying th gusts, and lisurly arrangd hr wid slvs as if
rolling thm up. Márya Dmítrivna always spok in Russian.
“Halth and happinss to hr whos nam day w ar kping and to hr
childrn,” sh said, in hr loud, full-tond voic which drownd all
othrs. “Wll, you old sinnr,” sh wnt on, turning to th count
who was kissing hr hand, “you’r fling dull in Moscow, I darsay?
Nowhr to hunt with your dogs? But what is to b don, old man? Just
s how ths nstlings ar growing up,” and sh pointd to th girls.
“You must look for husbands for thm whthr you lik it or not....”
“Wll,” said sh, “how’s my Cossack?” (Márya Dmítrivna
always calld Natásha a Cossack) and sh strokd th child’s arm as
sh cam up farlss and gay to kiss hr hand. “I know sh’s a scamp
of a girl, but I lik hr.”
Sh took a pair of par-shapd ruby arrings from hr hug rticul and,
having givn thm to th rosy Natásha, who bamd with th plasur
of hr saint’s-day ft, turnd away at onc and addrssd hrslf to
Pirr.
“h, h, frind! Com hr a bit,” said sh, assuming a soft high
ton of voic. “Com hr, my frind...” and sh ominously tuckd
up hr slvs still highr. Pirr approachd, looking at hr in a
childlik way through his spctacls.
“Com narr, com narr, frind! I usd to b th only on to tll
your fathr th truth whn h was in favor, and in your cas it’s my
vidnt duty.” Sh pausd. All wr silnt, xpctant of what was to
follow, for this was clarly only a prlud.
“A fin lad! My word! A fin lad!... His fathr lis on his dathbd
and h amuss himslf stting a policman astrid a bar! For sham,
sir, for sham! It would b bttr if you wnt to th war.”
Sh turnd away and gav hr hand to th count, who could hardly kp
from laughing.
“Wll, I suppos it is tim w wr at tabl?” said Márya
Dmítrivna.
Th count wnt in first with Márya Dmítrivna, th countss followd
on th arm of a colonl of hussars, a man of importanc to thm bcaus
Nicholas was to go with him to th rgimnt; thn cam Anna Mikháylovna
with Shinshín. Brg gav his arm to Vra. Th smiling Juli Karágina
wnt in with Nicholas. Aftr thm othr coupls followd, filling th
whol dining hall, and last of all th childrn, tutors, and govrnsss
followd singly. Th footmn bgan moving about, chairs scrapd, th
band struck up in th gallry, and th gusts sttld down in thir
placs. Thn th strains of th count’s houshold band wr rplacd
by th clattr of knivs and forks, th voics of visitors, and th
soft stps of th footmn. At on nd of th tabl sat th countss with
Márya Dmítrivna on hr right and Anna Mikháylovna on hr lft, th
othr lady visitors wr farthr down. At th othr nd sat th count,
with th hussar colonl on his lft and Shinshín and th othr mal
visitors on his right. Midway down th long tabl on on sid sat th
grown-up young popl: Vra bsid Brg, and Pirr bsid Borís; and
on th othr sid, th childrn, tutors, and govrnsss. From bhind
th crystal dcantrs and fruit vass, th count kpt glancing at his
wif and hr tall cap with its light-blu ribbons, and busily filld
his nighbors’ glasss, not nglcting his own. Th countss in turn,
without omitting hr dutis as hostss, thrw significant glancs from
bhind th pinappls at hr husband whos fac and bald had smd
by thir rdnss to contrast mor than usual with his gray hair. At th
ladis’ nd an vn chattr of voics was hard all th tim, at th
mn’s nd th voics soundd loudr and loudr, spcially that of th
colonl of hussars who, growing mor and mor flushd, at and drank so
much that th count hld him up as a pattrn to th othr gusts. Brg
with tndr smils was saying to Vra that lov is not an arthly but
a havnly fling. Borís was tlling his nw frind Pirr who th
gusts wr and xchanging glancs with Natásha, who was sitting
opposit. Pirr spok littl but xamind th nw facs, and at a
grat dal. Of th two soups h chos turtl with savory pattis and
wnt on to th gam without omitting a singl dish or on of th wins.
Ths lattr th butlr thrust mystriously forward, wrappd in a
napkin, from bhind th nxt man’s shouldrs and whisprd: “Dry
Madira”... “Hungarian”... or “Rhin win” as th cas might
b. Of th four crystal glasss ngravd with th count’s monogram
that stood bfor his plat, Pirr hld out on at random and drank
with njoymnt, gazing with vr-incrasing amiability at th othr
gusts. Natásha, who sat opposit, was looking at Borís as girls of
thirtn look at th boy thy ar in lov with and hav just kissd for
th first tim. Somtims that sam look fll on Pirr, and that funny
livly littl girl’s look mad him inclind to laugh without knowing
why.
Nicholas sat at som distanc from Sónya, bsid Juli Karágina, to
whom h was again talking with th sam involuntary smil. Sónya wor
a company smil but was vidntly tormntd by jalousy; now sh turnd
pal, now blushd and straind vry nrv to ovrhar what Nicholas
and Juli wr saying to on anothr. Th govrnss kpt looking round
unasily as if prparing to rsnt any slight that might b put upon th
childrn. Th Grman tutor was trying to rmmbr all th dishs, wins,
and kinds of dssrt, in ordr to snd a full dscription of th dinnr
to his popl in Grmany; and h flt gratly offndd whn th butlr
with a bottl wrappd in a napkin passd him by. H frownd, trying to
appar as if h did not want any of that win, but was mortifid bcaus
no on would undrstand that it was not to qunch his thirst or from
grdinss that h wantd it, but simply from a conscintious dsir for
knowldg.
CHAPTR XIX
At th mn’s nd of th tabl th talk grw mor and mor animatd.
Th colonl told thm that th dclaration of war had alrady appard
in Ptrsburg and that a copy, which h had himslf sn, had that day
bn forwardd by courir to th commandr in chif.
“And why th duc ar w going to fight Bonapart?” rmarkd
Shinshín. “H has stoppd Austria’s cackl and I far it will b
our turn nxt.”
Th colonl was a stout, tall, plthoric Grman, vidntly dvotd to
th srvic and patriotically Russian. H rsntd Shinshín’s rmark.
“It is for th rasson, my goot sir,” said h, spaking with a
Grman accnt, “for th rasson zat z mpror knows zat. H
dclars in z manifssto zat h cannot fiw wiz indiffrnc z dangr
vratning Russia and zat z safty and dignity of z mpir as vll
as z sanctity of its alliancs...” h spok this last word with
particular mphasis as if in it lay th gist of th mattr.
Thn with th unrring official mmory that charactrizd him h
rpatd from th opning words of th manifsto:
... and th wish, which constituts th mpror’s sol and absolut
aim—to stablish pac in urop on firm foundations—has now dcidd
him to dspatch part of th army abroad and to crat a nw condition
for th attainmnt of that purpos.
“Zat, my dar sir, is vy...” h concludd, drinking a tumblr of
win with dignity and looking to th count for approval.
“Connaissz-vous l Provrb:* ‘Jrom, Jrom, do not roam, but
turn spindls at hom!’?” said Shinshín, puckring his brows and
smiling. “Cla nous convint à mrvill.*(2) Suvórov now—h knw
what h was about; yt thy bat him à plat coutur,*(3) and whr
ar w to find Suvórovs now? J vous dmand un pu,” *(4) said h,
continually changing from Frnch to Russian.
     *Do you know th provrb?
     *(2) That suits us down to th ground.
     *(3) Hollow.
     *(4) I just ask you that.
“V must vight to th last tr-r-op of our plood!” said th colonl,
thumping th tabl; “and v must ti for our mpror, and zn all vill
p vll. And v must discuss it as littl as po-o-ossibl”... h dwlt
particularly on th word possibl... “as po-o-ossibl,” h ndd,
again turning to th count. “Zat is how v old hussars look at it, and
zr’s an nd of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar,
how do you judg of it?” h addd, addrssing Nicholas, who whn h
hard that th war was bing discussd had turnd from his partnr with
ys and ars intnt on th colonl.
“I am quit of your opinion,” rplid Nicholas, flaming up, turning
his plat round and moving his winglasss about with as much dcision
and dspration as though h wr at that momnt facing som grat
dangr. “I am convincd that w Russians must di or conqur,” h
concludd, conscious—as wr othrs—aftr th words wr uttrd
that his rmarks wr too nthusiastic and mphatic for th occasion and
wr thrfor awkward.
“What you said just now was splndid!” said his partnr Juli.
Sónya trmbld all ovr and blushd to hr ars and bhind thm and
down to hr nck and shouldrs whil Nicholas was spaking.
Pirr listnd to th colonl’s spch and noddd approvingly.
“That’s fin,” said h.
“Th young man’s a ral hussar!” shoutd th colonl, again
thumping th tabl.
“What ar you making such a nois about ovr thr?” Márya
Dmítrivna’s dp voic suddnly inquird from th othr nd of th
tabl. “What ar you thumping th tabl for?” sh dmandd of th
hussar, “and why ar you xciting yourslf? Do you think th Frnch
ar hr?”
“I am spaking z truc,” rplid th hussar with a smil.
“It’s all about th war,” th count shoutd down th tabl. “You
know my son’s going, Márya Dmítrivna? My son is going.”
“I hav four sons in th army but still I don’t frt. It is all
in God’s hands. You may di in your bd or God may spar you in a
battl,” rplid Márya Dmítrivna’s dp voic, which asily
carrid th whol lngth of th tabl.
“That’s tru!”
Onc mor th convrsations concntratd, th ladis’ at th on nd
and th mn’s at th othr.
“You won’t ask,” Natásha’s littl brothr was saying; “I know
you won’t ask!”
“I will,” rplid Natásha.
Hr fac suddnly flushd with rcklss and joyous rsolution. Sh half
ros, by a glanc inviting Pirr, who sat opposit, to listn to what
was coming, and turning to hr mothr:
“Mamma!” rang out th clar contralto nots of hr childish voic,
audibl th whol lngth of th tabl.
“What is it?” askd th countss, startld; but sing by hr
daughtr’s fac that it was only mischif, sh shook a fingr at hr
strnly with a thratning and forbidding movmnt of hr had.
Th convrsation was hushd.
“Mamma! What swts ar w going to hav?” and Natásha’s voic
soundd still mor firm and rsolut.
Th countss trid to frown, but could not. Márya Dmítrivna shook hr
fat fingr.
“Cossack!” sh said thratningly.
Most of th gusts, uncrtain how to rgard this sally, lookd at th
ldrs.
“You had bttr tak car!” said th countss.
“Mamma! What swts ar w going to hav?” Natásha again crid
boldly, with saucy gaity, confidnt that hr prank would b takn in
good part.
Sónya and fat littl Ptya doubld up with laughtr.
“You s! I hav askd,” whisprd Natásha to hr littl brothr
and to Pirr, glancing at him again.
“Ic pudding, but you won’t gt any,” said Márya Dmítrivna.
Natásha saw thr was nothing to b afraid of and so sh bravd vn
Márya Dmítrivna.
“Márya Dmítrivna! What kind of ic pudding? I don’t lik ic
cram.”
“Carrot ics.”
“No! What kind, Márya Dmítrivna? What kind?” sh almost scramd;
“I want to know!”
Márya Dmítrivna and th countss burst out laughing, and all th
gusts joind in. vryon laughd, not at Márya Dmítrivna’s answr
but at th incrdibl boldnss and smartnss of this littl girl who had
dard to trat Márya Dmítrivna in this fashion.
Natásha only dsistd whn sh had bn told that thr would b
pinappl ic. Bfor th ics, champagn was srvd round. Th band
again struck up, th count and countss kissd, and th gusts, laving
thir sats, wnt up to “congratulat” th countss, and rachd
across th tabl to clink glasss with th count, with th childrn, and
with on anothr. Again th footmn rushd about, chairs scrapd, and
in th sam ordr in which thy had ntrd but with rddr facs, th
gusts rturnd to th drawing room and to th count’s study.
CHAPTR XX
Th card tabls wr drawn out, sts mad up for boston, and th
count’s visitors sttld thmslvs, som in th two drawing rooms,
som in th sitting room, som in th library.
Th count, holding his cards fanwis, kpt himslf with difficulty from
dropping into his usual aftr-dinnr nap, and laughd at vrything.
Th young popl, at th countss’ instigation, gathrd round th
clavichord and harp. Juli by gnral rqust playd first. Aftr sh
had playd a littl air with variations on th harp, sh joind th
othr young ladis in bgging Natásha and Nicholas, who wr notd for
thir musical talnt, to sing somthing. Natásha, who was tratd as
though sh wr grown up, was vidntly vry proud of this but at th
sam tim flt shy.
“What shall w sing?” sh said.
“‘Th Brook,’” suggstd Nicholas.
“Wll, thn, lt’s b quick. Borís, com hr,” said Natásha.
“But whr is Sónya?”
Sh lookd round and sing that hr frind was not in th room ran to
look for hr.
Running into Sónya’s room and not finding hr thr, Natásha ran to
th nursry, but Sónya was not thr ithr. Natásha concludd that
sh must b on th chst in th passag. Th chst in th passag was
th plac of mourning for th youngr fmal gnration in th Rostóv
houshold. And thr in fact was Sónya lying fac downward on Nurs’s
dirty fathr bd on th top of th chst, crumpling hr gauzy pink
drss undr hr, hiding hr fac with hr slndr fingrs, and sobbing
so convulsivly that hr bar littl shouldrs shook. Natásha’s
fac, which had bn so radiantly happy all that saint’s day, suddnly
changd: hr ys bcam fixd, and thn a shivr passd down hr broad
nck and th cornrs of hr mouth droopd.
“Sónya! What is it? What is th mattr?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!” And
Natásha’s larg mouth widnd, making hr look quit ugly, and sh
bgan to wail lik a baby without knowing why, xcpt that Sónya was
crying. Sónya trid to lift hr had to answr but could not, and
hid hr fac still dpr in th bd. Natásha wpt, sitting on th
blu-stripd fathr bd and hugging hr frind. With an ffort Sónya
sat up and bgan wiping hr ys and xplaining.
“Nicholas is going away in a wk’s tim, his... paprs... hav
com... h told m himslf... but still I should not cry,” and sh
showd a papr sh hld in hr hand—with th vrss Nicholas had
writtn, “still, I should not cry, but you can’t... no on can
undrstand... what a soul h has!”
And sh bgan to cry again bcaus h had such a nobl soul.
“It’s all vry wll for you... I am not nvious... I lov you and
Borís also,” sh wnt on, gaining a littl strngth; “h is nic...
thr ar no difficultis in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin...
on would hav to... th Mtropolitan himslf... and vn thn it
can’t b don. And bsids, if sh tlls Mamma” (Sónya lookd upon
th countss as hr mothr and calld hr so) “that I am spoiling
Nicholas’ carr and am hartlss and ungratful, whil truly... God
is my witnss,” and sh mad th sign of th cross, “I lov hr so
much, and all of you, only Vra... And what for? What hav I don
to hr? I am so gratful to you that I would willingly sacrific
vrything, only I hav nothing....”
Sónya could not continu, and again hid hr fac in hr hands and in
th fathr bd. Natásha bgan consoling hr, but hr fac showd that
sh undrstood all th gravity of hr frind’s troubl.
“Sónya,” sh suddnly xclaimd, as if sh had gussd th tru
rason of hr frind’s sorrow, “I’m sur Vra has said somthing
to you sinc dinnr? Hasn’t sh?”
“Ys, ths vrss Nicholas wrot himslf and I copid som othrs,
and sh found thm on my tabl and said sh’d show thm to Mamma, and
that I was ungratful, and that Mamma would nvr allow him to marry
m, but that h’ll marry Juli. You s how h’s bn with hr all
day... Natásha, what hav I don to dsrv it?...”
And again sh bgan to sob, mor bittrly than bfor. Natásha liftd
hr up, huggd hr, and, smiling through hr tars, bgan comforting
hr.
“Sónya, don’t bliv hr, darling! Don’t bliv hr! Do you
rmmbr how w and Nicholas, all thr of us, talkd in th sitting
room aftr suppr? Why, w sttld how vrything was to b. I don’t
quit rmmbr how, but don’t you rmmbr that it could all b
arrangd and how nic it all was? Thr’s Uncl Shinshín’s brothr
has marrid his first cousin. And w ar only scond cousins, you know.
And Borís says it is quit possibl. You know I hav told him all about
it. And h is so clvr and so good!” said Natásha. “Don’t
you cry, Sónya, dar lov, darling Sónya!” and sh kissd hr and
laughd. “Vra’s spitful; nvr mind hr! And all will com right
and sh won’t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tll hr himslf,
and h dosn’t car at all for Juli.”
Natásha kissd hr on th hair.
Sónya sat up. Th littl kittn brightnd, its ys shon, and it
smd rady to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and bgin
playing with th ball of worstd as a kittn should.
“Do you think so?... Rally? Truly?” sh said, quickly smoothing hr
frock and hair.
“Rally, truly!” answrd Natásha, pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayd from undr hr frind’s plaits.
Both laughd.
“Wll, lt’s go and sing ‘Th Brook.’”
“Com along!”
“Do you know, that fat Pirr who sat opposit m is so funny!” said
Natásha, stopping suddnly. “I fl so happy!”
And sh st off at a run along th passag.
Sónya, shaking off som down which clung to hr and tucking away th
vrss in th bosom of hr drss clos to hr bony littl chst, ran
aftr Natásha down th passag into th sitting room with flushd fac
and light, joyous stps. At th visitors’ rqust th young popl
sang th quarttt, “Th Brook,” with which vryon was dlightd.
Thn Nicholas sang a song h had just larnd:
   At nighttim in th moon’s fair glow
     How swt, as fancis wandr fr,
   To fl that in this world thr’s on
     Who still is thinking but of th!
   That whil hr fingrs touch th harp
     Wafting swt music o’r th la,
   It is for th thus swlls hr hart,
     Sighing its mssag out to th...
   A day or two, thn bliss unspoilt,
     But oh! till thn I cannot liv!...
H had not finishd th last vrs bfor th young popl bgan to
gt rady to danc in th larg hall, and th sound of th ft and th
coughing of th musicians wr hard from th gallry.
Pirr was sitting in th drawing room whr Shinshín had ngagd him,
as a man rcntly rturnd from abroad, in a political convrsation in
which svral othrs joind but which bord Pirr. Whn th music bgan
Natásha cam in and walking straight up to Pirr said, laughing and
blushing:
“Mamma told m to ask you to join th dancrs.”
“I am afraid of mixing th figurs,” Pirr rplid; “but if you
will b my tachr...” And lowring his big arm h offrd it to th
slndr littl girl.
Whil th coupls wr arranging thmslvs and th musicians tuning up,
Pirr sat down with his littl partnr. Natásha was prfctly happy;
sh was dancing with a grown-up man, who had bn abroad. Sh was
sitting in a conspicuous plac and talking to him lik a grown-up lady.
Sh had a fan in hr hand that on of th ladis had givn hr to hold.
Assuming quit th pos of a socity woman (havn knows whn and whr
sh had larnd it) sh talkd with hr partnr, fanning hrslf and
smiling ovr th fan.
“Dar, dar! Just look at hr!” xclaimd th countss as sh
crossd th ballroom, pointing to Natásha.
Natásha blushd and laughd.
“Wll, rally, Mamma! Why should you? What is thr to b surprisd
at?”
In th midst of th third cossais thr was a clattr of chairs bing
pushd back in th sitting room whr th count and Márya Dmítrivna
had bn playing cards with th majority of th mor distinguishd and
oldr visitors. Thy now, strtching thmslvs aftr sitting so long,
and rplacing thir purss and pocktbooks, ntrd th ballroom. First
cam Márya Dmítrivna and th count, both with mrry countnancs. Th
count, with playful crmony somwhat in ballt styl, offrd his
bnt arm to Márya Dmítrivna. H drw himslf up, a smil of dbonair
gallantry lit up his fac and as soon as th last figur of th
cossais was ndd, h clappd his hands to th musicians and shoutd
up to thir gallry, addrssing th first violin:
“Smën! Do you know th Danil Coopr?”
This was th count’s favorit danc, which h had dancd in his youth.
(Strictly spaking, Danil Coopr was on figur of th anglais.)
“Look at Papa!” shoutd Natásha to th whol company, and quit
forgtting that sh was dancing with a grown-up partnr sh bnt hr
curly had to hr kns and mad th whol room ring with hr laughtr.
And indd vrybody in th room lookd with a smil of plasur at th
jovial old gntlman, who standing bsid his tall and stout partnr,
Márya Dmítrivna, curvd his arms, bat tim, straightnd his
shouldrs, turnd out his tos, tappd gntly with his foot, and, by
a smil that broadnd his round fac mor and mor, prpard th
onlookrs for what was to follow. As soon as th provocativly gay
strains of Danil Coopr (somwhat rsmbling thos of a mrry pasant
danc) bgan to sound, all th doorways of th ballroom wr suddnly
filld by th domstic srfs—th mn on on sid and th womn on
th othr—who with baming facs had com to s thir mastr making
mrry.
“Just look at th mastr! A rgular agl h is!” loudly rmarkd
th nurs, as sh stood in on of th doorways.
Th count dancd wll and knw it. But his partnr could not and did not
want to danc wll. Hr normous figur stood rct, hr powrful arms
hanging down (sh had handd hr rticul to th countss), and only hr
strn but handsom fac rally joind in th danc. What was xprssd
by th whol of th count’s plump figur, in Márya Dmítrivna found
xprssion only in hr mor and mor baming fac and quivring nos.
But if th count, gtting mor and mor into th swing of it, charmd
th spctators by th unxpctdnss of his adroit manuvrs and
th agility with which h caprd about on his light ft, Márya
Dmítrivna producd no lss imprssion by slight xrtions—th last
ffort to mov hr shouldrs or bnd hr arms whn turning, or stamp
hr foot—which vryon apprciatd in viw of hr siz and habitual
svrity. Th danc grw livlir and livlir. Th othr coupls could
not attract a momnt’s attntion to thir own volutions and did not
vn try to do so. All wr watching th count and Márya Dmítrivna.
Natásha kpt pulling vryon by slv or drss, urging thm to
“look at Papa!” though as it was thy nvr took thir ys off th
coupl. In th intrvals of th danc th count, brathing dply, wavd
and shoutd to th musicians to play fastr. Fastr, fastr, and fastr;
lightly, mor lightly, and yt mor lightly whirld th count, flying
round Márya Dmítrivna, now on his tos, now on his hls; until,
turning his partnr round to hr sat, h xcutd th final pas,
raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his prspiring had, smiling
and making a wid swp with his arm, amid a thundr of applaus and
laughtr ld by Natásha. Both partnrs stood still, brathing havily
and wiping thir facs with thir cambric handkrchifs.
“That’s how w usd to danc in our tim, ma chèr,” said th
count.
“That was a Danil Coopr!” xclaimd Márya Dmítrivna, tucking up
hr slvs and puffing havily.
CHAPTR XXI
Whil in th Rostóvs’ ballroom th sixth anglais was bing dancd,
to a tun in which th wary musicians blundrd, and whil tird
footmn and cooks wr gtting th suppr, Count Bzúkhov had a
sixth strok. Th doctors pronouncd rcovry impossibl. Aftr a mut
confssion, communion was administrd to th dying man, prparations
mad for th sacramnt of unction, and in his hous thr was th bustl
and thrill of suspns usual at such momnts. Outsid th hous, byond
th gats, a group of undrtakrs, who hid whnvr a carriag drov up,
waitd in xpctation of an important ordr for an xpnsiv funral.
Th Military Govrnor of Moscow, who had bn assiduous in snding
aids-d-camp to inquir aftr th count’s halth, cam himslf
that vning to bid a last farwll to th clbratd grand of
Cathrin’s court, Count Bzúkhov.
Th magnificnt rcption room was crowdd. vryon stood up
rspctfully whn th Military Govrnor, having stayd about half an
hour alon with th dying man, passd out, slightly acknowldging thir
bows and trying to scap as quickly as possibl from th glancs fixd
on him by th doctors, clrgy, and rlativs of th family. Princ
Vasíli, who had grown thinnr and palr during th last fw days,
scortd him to th door, rpating somthing to him svral tims in
low tons.
Whn th Military Govrnor had gon, Princ Vasíli sat down all alon
on a chair in th ballroom, crossing on lg high ovr th othr,
laning his lbow on his kn and covring his fac with his hand. Aftr
sitting so for a whil h ros, and, looking about him with frightnd
ys, wnt with unusually hurrid stps down th long corridor lading
to th back of th hous, to th room of th ldst princss.
Thos who wr in th dimly lit rcption room spok in nrvous
whisprs, and, whnvr anyon wnt into or cam from th dying man’s
room, grw silnt and gazd with ys full of curiosity or xpctancy at
his door, which crakd slightly whn opnd.
“Th limits of human lif ... ar fixd and may not b
o’rpassd,” said an old prist to a lady who had takn a sat
bsid him and was listning naïvly to his words.
“I wondr, is it not too lat to administr unction?” askd th
lady, adding th prist’s clrical titl, as if sh had no opinion of
hr own on th subjct.
“Ah, madam, it is a grat sacramnt,” rplid th prist, passing
his hand ovr th thin grizzld strands of hair combd back across his
bald had.
“Who was that? Th Military Govrnor himslf?” was bing askd at
th othr sid of th room. “How young-looking h is!”
“Ys, and h is ovr sixty. I har th count no longr rcognizs
anyon. Thy wishd to administr th sacramnt of unction.”
“I knw somon who rcivd that sacramnt svn tims.”
Th scond princss had just com from th sickroom with hr ys rd
from wping and sat down bsid Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a
gracful pos undr a portrait of Cathrin, laning his lbow on a
tabl.
“Bautiful,” said th doctor in answr to a rmark about th
wathr. “Th wathr is bautiful, Princss; and bsids, in Moscow
on fls as if on wr in th country.”
“Ys, indd,” rplid th princss with a sigh. “So h may hav
somthing to drink?”
Lorrain considrd.
“Has h takn his mdicin?”
“Ys.”
Th doctor glancd at his watch.
“Tak a glass of boild watr and put a pinch of cram of tartar,”
and h indicatd with his dlicat fingrs what h mant by a pinch.
“Dr has nffr bn a gas,” a Grman doctor was saying to an
aid-d-camp, “dat on liffs aftr d sird strok.”
“And what a wll-prsrvd man h was!” rmarkd th aid-d-camp.
“And who will inhrit his walth?” h addd in a whispr.
“It von’t go bgging,” rplid th Grman with a smil.
vryon again lookd toward th door, which crakd as th scond
princss wnt in with th drink sh had prpard according to
Lorrain’s instructions. Th Grman doctor wnt up to Lorrain.
“Do you think h can last till morning?” askd th Grman,
addrssing Lorrain in Frnch which h pronouncd badly.
Lorrain, pursing up his lips, wavd a svrly ngativ fingr bfor
his nos.
“Tonight, not latr,” said h in a low voic, and h movd away
with a dcorous smil of slf-satisfaction at bing abl clarly to
undrstand and stat th patint’s condition.
Manwhil Princ Vasíli had opnd th door into th princss’ room.
In this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps wr burning bfor
th icons and thr was a plasant scnt of flowrs and burnt pastills.
Th room was crowdd with small pics of furnitur, whatnots,
cupboards, and littl tabls. Th quilt of a high, whit fathr bd was
just visibl bhind a scrn. A small dog bgan to bark.
“Ah, is it you, cousin?”
Sh ros and smoothd hr hair, which was as usual so xtrmly smooth
that it smd to b mad of on pic with hr had and covrd with
varnish.
“Has anything happnd?” sh askd. “I am so trrifid.”
“No, thr is no chang. I only cam to hav a talk about businss,
Catich,” * muttrd th princ, sating himslf warily on th chair
sh had just vacatd. “You hav mad th plac warm, I must say,” h
rmarkd. “Wll, sit down: lt’s hav a talk.”
     *Cathrin.
“I thought prhaps somthing had happnd,” sh said with hr
unchanging stonily svr xprssion; and, sitting down opposit th
princ, sh prpard to listn.
“I wishd to gt a nap, mon cousin, but I can’t.”
“Wll, my dar?” said Princ Vasíli, taking hr hand and bnding it
downwards as was his habit.
It was plain that this “wll?” rfrrd to much that thy both
undrstood without naming.
Th princss, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for hr
lgs, lookd dirctly at Princ Vasíli with no sign of motion in hr
prominnt gray ys. Thn sh shook hr had and glancd up at th icons
with a sigh. This might hav bn takn as an xprssion of sorrow
and dvotion, or of warinss and hop of rsting bfor long. Princ
Vasíli undrstood it as an xprssion of warinss.
“And I?” h said; “do you think it is asir for m? I am as worn
out as a post hors, but still I must hav a talk with you, Catich, a
vry srious talk.”
Princ Vasíli said no mor and his chks bgan to twitch nrvously,
now on on sid, now on th othr, giving his fac an unplasant
xprssion which was nvr to b sn on it in a drawing room. His ys
too smd strang; at on momnt thy lookd impudntly sly and at th
nxt glancd round in alarm.
Th princss, holding hr littl dog on hr lap with hr thin bony
hands, lookd attntivly into Princ Vasíli’s ys vidntly
rsolvd not to b th first to brak silnc, if sh had to wait till
morning.
“Wll, you s, my dar princss and cousin, Cathrin Smënovna,”
continud Princ Vasíli, rturning to his thm, apparntly not
without an innr struggl; “at such a momnt as this on must think
of vrything. On must think of th futur, of all of you... I lov you
all, lik childrn of my own, as you know.”
Th princss continud to look at him without moving, and with th sam
dull xprssion.
“And thn of cours my family has also to b considrd,” Princ
Vasíli wnt on, tstily pushing away a littl tabl without looking at
hr. “You know, Catich, that w—you thr sistrs, Mámontov, and
my wif—ar th count’s only dirct hirs. I know, I know how hard
it is for you to talk or think of such mattrs. It is no asir for
m; but, my dar, I am gtting on for sixty and must b prpard for
anything. Do you know I hav snt for Pirr? Th count,” pointing to
his portrait, “dfinitly dmandd that h should b calld.”
Princ Vasíli lookd qustioningly at th princss, but could not mak
out whthr sh was considring what h had just said or whthr sh was
simply looking at him.
“Thr is on thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,” sh
rplid, “and it is that H would b mrciful to him and would allow
his nobl soul pacfully to lav this...”
“Ys, ys, of cours,” intrruptd Princ Vasíli impatintly,
rubbing his bald had and angrily pulling back toward him th littl
tabl that h had pushd away. “But... in short, th fact is... you
know yourslf that last wintr th count mad a will by which h lft
all his proprty, not to us his dirct hirs, but to Pirr.”
“H has mad wills nough!” quitly rmarkd th princss. “But h
cannot lav th stat to Pirr. Pirr is illgitimat.”
“But, my dar,” said Princ Vasíli suddnly, clutching th littl
tabl and bcoming mor animatd and talking mor rapidly: “what if
a lttr has bn writtn to th mpror in which th count asks for
Pirr’s lgitimation? Do you undrstand that in considration of th
count’s srvics, his rqust would b grantd?...”
Th princss smild as popl do who think thy know mor about th
subjct undr discussion than thos thy ar talking with.
“I can tll you mor,” continud Princ Vasíli, sizing hr hand,
“that lttr was writtn, though it was not snt, and th mpror knw
of it. Th only qustion is, has it bn dstroyd or not? If not, thn
as soon as all is ovr,” and Princ Vasíli sighd to intimat what h
mant by th words all is ovr, “and th count’s paprs ar opnd,
th will and lttr will b dlivrd to th mpror, and th ptition
will crtainly b grantd. Pirr will gt vrything as th lgitimat
son.”
“And our shar?” askd th princss smiling ironically, as if
anything might happn, only not that.
“But, my poor Catich, it is as clar as daylight! H will thn b th
lgal hir to vrything and you won’t gt anything. You must know,
my dar, whthr th will and lttr wr writtn, and whthr thy hav
bn dstroyd or not. And if thy hav somhow bn ovrlookd, you
ought to know whr thy ar, and must find thm, bcaus...”
“What nxt?” th princss intrruptd, smiling sardonically and not
changing th xprssion of hr ys. “I am a woman, and you think w
ar all stupid; but I know this: an illgitimat son cannot inhrit...
un bâtard!”* sh addd, as if supposing that this translation of th
word would ffctivly prov to Princ Vasíli th invalidity of his
contntion.
     * A bastard.
“Wll, rally, Catich! Can’t you undrstand! You ar so
intllignt, how is it you don’t s that if th count has writtn a
lttr to th mpror bgging him to rcogniz Pirr as lgitimat, it
follows that Pirr will not b Pirr but will bcom Count Bzúkhov,
and will thn inhrit vrything undr th will? And if th will and
lttr ar not dstroyd, thn you will hav nothing but th consolation
of having bn dutiful t tout c qui s’nsuit!* That’s crtain.”
     * And all that follows thrfrom.
“I know th will was mad, but I also know that it is invalid;
and you, mon cousin, sm to considr m a prfct fool,” said th
princss with th xprssion womn assum whn thy suppos thy ar
saying somthing witty and stinging.
“My dar Princss Cathrin Smënovna,” bgan Princ Vasíli
impatintly, “I cam hr not to wrangl with you, but to talk about
your intrsts as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, tru rlation. And I
tll you for th tnth tim that if th lttr to th mpror and th
will in Pirr’s favor ar among th count’s paprs, thn, my dar
girl, you and your sistrs ar not hirsss! If you don’t bliv m,
thn bliv an xprt. I hav just bn talking to Dmítri Onúfrich”
(th family solicitor) “and h says th sam.”
At this a suddn chang vidntly took plac in th princss’ idas;
hr thin lips grw whit, though hr ys did not chang, and hr voic
whn sh bgan to spak passd through such transitions as sh hrslf
vidntly did not xpct.
“That would b a fin thing!” said sh. “I nvr wantd anything
and I don’t now.”
Sh pushd th littl dog off hr lap and smoothd hr drss.
“And this is gratitud—this is rcognition for thos who hav
sacrificd vrything for his sak!” sh crid. “It’s splndid!
Fin! I don’t want anything, Princ.”
“Ys, but you ar not th only on. Thr ar your sistrs...”
rplid Princ Vasíli.
But th princss did not listn to him.
“Ys, I knw it long ago but had forgottn. I knw that I could xpct
nothing but mannss, dcit, nvy, intrigu, and ingratitud—th
blackst ingratitud—in this hous...”
“Do you or do you not know whr that will is?” insistd Princ
Vasíli, his chks twitching mor than vr.
“Ys, I was a fool! I still blivd in popl, lovd thm, and
sacrificd myslf. But only th bas, th vil succd! I know who has
bn intriguing!”
Th princss wishd to ris, but th princ hld hr by th hand. Sh
had th air of on who has suddnly lost faith in th whol human rac.
Sh gav hr companion an angry glanc.
“Thr is still tim, my dar. You must rmmbr, Catich, that it was
all don casually in a momnt of angr, of illnss, and was aftrwards
forgottn. Our duty, my dar, is to rctify his mistak, to as his
last momnts by not ltting him commit this injustic, and not to lt
him di fling that h is rndring unhappy thos who...”
“Who sacrificd vrything for him,” chimd in th princss, who
would again hav risn had not th princ still hld hr fast, “though
h nvr could apprciat it. No, mon cousin,” sh addd with a sigh,
“I shall always rmmbr that in this world on must xpct no rward,
that in this world thr is nithr honor nor justic. In this world on
has to b cunning and crul.”
“Now com, com! B rasonabl. I know your xcllnt hart.”
“No, I hav a wickd hart.”
“I know your hart,” rpatd th princ. “I valu your frindship
and wish you to hav as good an opinion of m. Don’t upst yourslf,
and lt us talk snsibly whil thr is still tim, b it a day or b it
but an hour.... Tll m all you know about th will, and abov all whr
it is. You must know. W will tak it at onc and show it to th
count. H has, no doubt, forgottn it and will wish to dstroy it.
You undrstand that my sol dsir is conscintiously to carry out his
wishs; that is my only rason for bing hr. I cam simply to hlp him
and you.”
“Now I s it all! I know who has bn intriguing—I know!” crid
th princss.
“That’s not th point, my dar.”
“It’s that protg of yours, that swt Princss Drubtskáya,
that Anna Mikháylovna whom I would not tak for a housmaid... th
infamous, vil woman!”
“Do not lt us los any tim...”
“Ah, don’t talk to m! Last wintr sh whdld hrslf in hr and
told th count such vil, disgracful things about us, spcially about
Sophi—I can’t rpat thm—that it mad th count quit ill and h
would not s us for a whol fortnight. I know it was thn h wrot this
vil, infamous papr, but I thought th thing was invalid.”
“W’v got to it at last—why did you not tll m about it
soonr?”
“It’s in th inlaid portfolio that h kps undr his pillow,”
said th princss, ignoring his qustion. “Now I know! Ys; if I hav
a sin, a grat sin, it is hatrd of that vil woman!” almost shrikd
th princss, now quit changd. “And what dos sh com worming
hrslf in hr for? But I will giv hr a pic of my mind. Th tim
will com!”
CHAPTR XXII
Whil ths convrsations wr going on in th rcption room and th
princss’ room, a carriag containing Pirr (who had bn snt for)
and Anna Mikháylovna (who found it ncssary to accompany him) was
driving into th court of Count Bzúkhov’s hous. As th whls
rolld softly ovr th straw bnath th windows, Anna Mikháylovna,
having turnd with words of comfort to hr companion, ralizd that
h was aslp in his cornr and wok him up. Rousing himslf, Pirr
followd Anna Mikháylovna out of th carriag, and only thn bgan
to think of th intrviw with his dying fathr which awaitd him. H
noticd that thy had not com to th front ntranc but to th back
door. Whil h was gtting down from th carriag stps two mn, who
lookd lik tradspopl, ran hurridly from th ntranc and hid in th
shadow of th wall. Pausing for a momnt, Pirr noticd svral othr
mn of th sam kind hiding in th shadow of th hous on both sids.
But nithr Anna Mikháylovna nor th footman nor th coachman, who
could not hlp sing ths popl, took any notic of thm. “It sms
to b all right,” Pirr concludd, and followd Anna Mikháylovna.
Sh hurridly ascndd th narrow dimly lit ston staircas, calling to
Pirr, who was lagging bhind, to follow. Though h did not s why it
was ncssary for him to go to th count at all, still lss why h had
to go by th back stairs, yt judging by Anna Mikháylovna’s air
of assuranc and hast, Pirr concludd that it was all absolutly
ncssary. Halfway up th stairs thy wr almost knockd ovr by
som mn who, carrying pails, cam running downstairs, thir boots
clattring. Ths mn prssd clos to th wall to lt Pirr and Anna
Mikháylovna pass and did not vinc th last surpris at sing thm
thr.
“Is this th way to th princsss’ apartmnts?” askd Anna
Mikháylovna of on of thm.
“Ys,” rplid a footman in a bold loud voic, as if anything wr
now prmissibl; “th door to th lft, ma’am.”
“Prhaps th count did not ask for m,” said Pirr whn h rachd
th landing. “I’d bttr go to my own room.”
Anna Mikháylovna pausd and waitd for him to com up.
“Ah, my frind!” sh said, touching his arm as sh had don hr
son’s whn spaking to him that aftrnoon, “bliv m I suffr no
lss than you do, but b a man!”
“But rally, hadn’t I bttr go away?” h askd, looking kindly at
hr ovr his spctacls.
“Ah, my dar frind! Forgt th wrongs that may hav bn don you.
Think that h is your fathr ... prhaps in th agony of dath.” Sh
sighd. “I hav lovd you lik a son from th first. Trust yourslf to
m, Pirr. I shall not forgt your intrsts.”
Pirr did not undrstand a word, but th conviction that all this had
to b grw strongr, and h mkly followd Anna Mikháylovna who was
alrady opning a door.
This door ld into a back antroom. An old man, a srvant of th
princsss, sat in a cornr knitting a stocking. Pirr had nvr bn
in this part of th hous and did not vn know of th xistnc of
ths rooms. Anna Mikháylovna, addrssing a maid who was hurrying past
with a dcantr on a tray as “my dar” and “my swt,” askd
about th princss’ halth and thn ld Pirr along a ston passag.
Th first door on th lft ld into th princsss’ apartmnts. Th
maid with th dcantr in hr hast had not closd th door (vrything
in th hous was don in hast at that tim), and Pirr and Anna
Mikháylovna in passing instinctivly glancd into th room, whr
Princ Vasíli and th ldst princss wr sitting clos togthr
talking. Sing thm pass, Princ Vasíli drw back with obvious
impatinc, whil th princss jumpd up and with a gstur of
dspration slammd th door with all hr might.
This action was so unlik hr usual composur and th far dpictd on
Princ Vasíli’s fac so out of kping with his dignity that Pirr
stoppd and glancd inquiringly ovr his spctacls at his guid. Anna
Mikháylovna vincd no surpris, sh only smild faintly and sighd, as
if to say that this was no mor than sh had xpctd.
“B a man, my frind. I will look aftr your intrsts,” said sh in
rply to his look, and wnt still fastr along th passag.
Pirr could not mak out what it was all about, and still lss what
“watching ovr his intrsts” mant, but h dcidd that all ths
things had to b. From th passag thy wnt into a larg, dimly
lit room adjoining th count’s rcption room. It was on of thos
sumptuous but cold apartmnts known to Pirr only from th front
approach, but vn in this room thr now stood an mpty bath, and watr
had bn spilld on th carpt. Thy wr mt by a dacon with a cnsr
and by a srvant who passd out on tipto without hding thm. Thy
wnt into th rcption room familiar to Pirr, with two Italian
windows opning into th consrvatory, with its larg bust and full
lngth portrait of Cathrin th Grat. Th sam popl wr still
sitting hr in almost th sam positions as bfor, whispring to on
anothr. All bcam silnt and turnd to look at th pal tar-worn Anna
Mikháylovna as sh ntrd, and at th big stout figur of Pirr who,
hanging his had, mkly followd hr.
Anna Mikháylovna’s fac xprssd a consciousnss that th dcisiv
momnt had arrivd. With th air of a practical Ptrsburg lady sh now,
kping Pirr clos bsid hr, ntrd th room vn mor boldly than
that aftrnoon. Sh flt that as sh brought with hr th prson th
dying man wishd to s, hr own admission was assurd. Casting a rapid
glanc at all thos in th room and noticing th count’s confssor
thr, sh glidd up to him with a sort of ambl, not xactly bowing yt
sming to grow suddnly smallr, and rspctfully rcivd th blssing
first of on and thn of anothr prist.
“God b thankd that you ar in tim,” said sh to on of th
prists; “all w rlativs hav bn in such anxity. This young
man is th count’s son,” sh addd mor softly. “What a trribl
momnt!”
Having said this sh wnt up to th doctor.
“Dar doctor,” said sh, “this young man is th count’s son. Is
thr any hop?”
Th doctor cast a rapid glanc upwards and silntly shruggd his
shouldrs. Anna Mikháylovna with just th sam movmnt raisd hr
shouldrs and ys, almost closing th lattr, sighd, and movd away
from th doctor to Pirr. To him, in a particularly rspctful and
tndrly sad voic, sh said:
“Trust in His mrcy!” and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit
and wait for hr, sh wnt silntly toward th door that vryon was
watching and it crakd vry slightly as sh disappard bhind it.
Pirr, having mad up his mind to oby his monitrss implicitly, movd
toward th sofa sh had indicatd. As soon as Anna Mikháylovna had
disappard h noticd that th ys of all in th room turnd to him
with somthing mor than curiosity and sympathy. H noticd that thy
whisprd to on anothr, casting significant looks at him with a kind
of aw and vn srvility. A dfrnc such as h had nvr bfor
rcivd was shown him. A strang lady, th on who had bn talking to
th prists, ros and offrd him hr sat; an aid-d-camp pickd up
and rturnd a glov Pirr had droppd; th doctors bcam rspctfully
silnt as h passd by, and movd to mak way for him. At first Pirr
wishd to tak anothr sat so as not to troubl th lady, and also to
pick up th glov himslf and to pass round th doctors who wr not
vn in his way; but all at onc h flt that this would not do, and
that tonight h was a prson obligd to prform som sort of awful
rit which vryon xpctd of him, and that h was thrfor bound
to accpt thir srvics. H took th glov in silnc from th
aid-d-camp, and sat down in th lady’s chair, placing his hug hands
symmtrically on his kns in th naïv attitud of an gyptian statu,
and dcidd in his own mind that all was as it should b, and that in
ordr not to los his had and do foolish things h must not act on his
own idas tonight, but must yild himslf up ntirly to th will of
thos who wr guiding him.
Not two minuts had passd bfor Princ Vasíli with had rct
majstically ntrd th room. H was waring his long coat with thr
stars on his brast. H smd to hav grown thinnr sinc th morning;
his ys smd largr than usual whn h glancd round and noticd
Pirr. H wnt up to him, took his hand (a thing h nvr usd to do),
and drw it downwards as if wishing to ascrtain whthr it was firmly
fixd on.
“Courag, courag, my frind! H has askd to s you. That is
wll!” and h turnd to go.
But Pirr thought it ncssary to ask: “How is...” and hsitatd,
not knowing whthr it would b propr to call th dying man “th
count,” yt ashamd to call him “fathr.”
“H had anothr strok about half an hour ago. Courag, my
frind...”
Pirr’s mind was in such a confusd stat that th word “strok”
suggstd to him a blow from somthing. H lookd at Princ Vasíli
in prplxity, and only latr graspd that a strok was an attack of
illnss. Princ Vasíli said somthing to Lorrain in passing and wnt
through th door on tipto. H could not walk wll on tipto and his
whol body jrkd at ach stp. Th ldst princss followd him, and
th prists and dacons and som srvants also wnt in at th door.
Through that door was hard a nois of things bing movd about, and
at last Anna Mikháylovna, still with th sam xprssion, pal but
rsolut in th discharg of duty, ran out and touching Pirr lightly
on th arm said:
“Th divin mrcy is inxhaustibl! Unction is about to b
administrd. Com.”
Pirr wnt in at th door, stpping on th soft carpt, and noticd
that th strang lady, th aid-d-camp, and som of th srvants, all
followd him in, as if thr wr now no furthr nd for prmission to
ntr that room.
CHAPTR XXIII
Pirr wll knw this larg room dividd by columns and an arch, its
walls hung round with Prsian carpts. Th part of th room bhind th
columns, with a high silk-curtaind mahogany bdstad on on sid and
on th othr an immns cas containing icons, was brightly illuminatd
with rd light lik a Russian church during vning srvic. Undr
th glaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair
on snowy-whit smooth pillows, vidntly frshly changd, Pirr
saw—covrd to th waist by a bright grn quilt—th familiar,
majstic figur of his fathr, Count Bzúkhov, with that gray man of
hair abov his broad forhad which rmindd on of a lion, and th dp
charactristically nobl wrinkls of his handsom, ruddy fac. H lay
just undr th icons; his larg thick hands outsid th quilt. Into th
right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax tapr had bn thrust
btwn forfingr and thumb, and an old srvant, bnding ovr from
bhind th chair, hld it in position. By th chair stood th prists,
thir long hair falling ovr thir magnificnt glittring vstmnts,
with lightd taprs in thir hands, slowly and solmnly conducting th
srvic. A littl bhind thm stood th two youngr princsss holding
handkrchifs to thir ys, and just in front of thm thir ldst
sistr, Catich, with a vicious and dtrmind look stadily fixd on
th icons, as though dclaring to all that sh could not answr for
hrslf should sh glanc round. Anna Mikháylovna, with a mk,
sorrowful, and all-forgiving xprssion on hr fac, stood by th door
nar th strang lady. Princ Vasíli in front of th door, nar th
invalid chair, a wax tapr in his lft hand, was laning his lft arm on
th carvd back of a vlvt chair h had turnd round for th purpos,
and was crossing himslf with his right hand, turning his ys upward
ach tim h touchd his forhad. His fac wor a calm look of pity
and rsignation to th will of God. “If you do not undrstand ths
sntimnts,” h smd to b saying, “so much th wors for you!”
Bhind him stood th aid-d-camp, th doctors, and th mnsrvants;
th mn and womn had sparatd as in church. All wr silntly crossing
thmslvs, and th rading of th church srvic, th subdud chanting
of dp bass voics, and in th intrvals sighs and th shuffling of
ft wr th only sounds that could b hard. Anna Mikháylovna, with
an air of importanc that showd that sh flt sh quit knw what sh
was about, wnt across th room to whr Pirr was standing and gav
him a tapr. H lit it and, distractd by obsrving thos around him,
bgan crossing himslf with th hand that hld th tapr.
Sophi, th rosy, laughtr-loving, youngst princss with th mol,
watchd him. Sh smild, hid hr fac in hr handkrchif, and rmaind
with it hiddn for awhil; thn looking up and sing Pirr sh
again bgan to laugh. Sh vidntly flt unabl to look at him
without laughing, but could not rsist looking at him: so to b out of
tmptation sh slippd quitly bhind on of th columns. In th midst
of th srvic th voics of th prists suddnly casd, thy whisprd
to on anothr, and th old srvant who was holding th count’s hand
got up and said somthing to th ladis. Anna Mikháylovna stppd
forward and, stooping ovr th dying man, bckond to Lorrain from
bhind hr back. Th Frnch doctor hld no tapr; h was laning
against on of th columns in a rspctful attitud implying that h,
a forignr, in spit of all diffrncs of faith, undrstood th full
importanc of th rit now bing prformd and vn approvd of it. H
now approachd th sick man with th noislss stp of on in full vigor
of lif, with his dlicat whit fingrs raisd from th grn quilt th
hand that was fr, and turning sidways flt th puls and rflctd
a momnt. Th sick man was givn somthing to drink, thr was a
stir around him, thn th popl rsumd thir placs and th srvic
continud. During this intrval Pirr noticd that Princ Vasíli
lft th chair on which h had bn laning, and—with an air
which intimatd that h knw what h was about and if othrs did not
undrstand him it was so much th wors for thm—did not go up to th
dying man, but passd by him, joind th ldst princss, and movd
with hr to th sid of th room whr stood th high bdstad with its
silkn hangings. On laving th bd both Princ Vasíli and th princss
passd out by a back door, but rturnd to thir placs on aftr th
othr bfor th srvic was concludd. Pirr paid no mor attntion
to this occurrnc than to th rst of what wnt on, having mad up his
mind onc for all that what h saw happning around him that vning was
in som way ssntial.
Th chanting of th srvic casd, and th voic of th prist was
hard rspctfully congratulating th dying man on having rcivd th
sacramnt. Th dying man lay as liflss and immovabl as bfor. Around
him vryon bgan to stir: stps wr audibl and whisprs, among which
Anna Mikháylovna’s was th most distinct.
Pirr hard hr say:
“Crtainly h must b movd onto th bd; hr it will b
impossibl...”
Th sick man was so surroundd by doctors, princsss, and srvants
that Pirr could no longr s th rddish-yllow fac with its gray
man—which, though h saw othr facs as wll, h had not lost sight
of for a singl momnt during th whol srvic. H judgd by th
cautious movmnts of thos who crowdd round th invalid chair that
thy had liftd th dying man and wr moving him.
“Catch hold of my arm or you’ll drop him!” h hard on of th
srvants say in a frightnd whispr. “Catch hold from undrnath.
Hr!” xclaimd diffrnt voics; and th havy brathing of th
barrs and th shuffling of thir ft grw mor hurrid, as if th
wight thy wr carrying wr too much for thm.
As th barrs, among whom was Anna Mikháylovna, passd th young man
h caught a momntary glimps btwn thir hads and backs of th dying
man’s high, stout, uncovrd chst and powrful shouldrs, raisd by
thos who wr holding him undr th armpits, and of his gray, curly,
lonin had. This had, with its rmarkably broad brow and chkbons,
its handsom, snsual mouth, and its cold, majstic xprssion, was
not disfigurd by th approach of dath. It was th sam as Pirr
rmmbrd it thr months bfor, whn th count had snt him to
Ptrsburg. But now this had was swaying hlplssly with th unvn
movmnts of th barrs, and th cold listlss gaz fixd itslf upon
nothing.
Aftr a fw minuts’ bustl bsid th high bdstad, thos who had
carrid th sick man disprsd. Anna Mikháylovna touchd Pirr’s
hand and said, “Com.” Pirr wnt with hr to th bd on which th
sick man had bn laid in a statly pos in kping with th crmony
just compltd. H lay with his had proppd high on th pillows. His
hands wr symmtrically placd on th grn silk quilt, th palms
downward. Whn Pirr cam up th count was gazing straight at him, but
with a look th significanc of which could not b undrstood by mortal
man. ithr this look mant nothing but that as long as on has ys
thy must look somwhr, or it mant too much. Pirr hsitatd,
not knowing what to do, and glancd inquiringly at his guid. Anna
Mikháylovna mad a hurrid sign with hr ys, glancing at th sick
man’s hand and moving hr lips as if to snd it a kiss. Pirr,
carfully strtching his nck so as not to touch th quilt, followd hr
suggstion and prssd his lips to th larg bond, flshy hand. Nithr
th hand nor a singl muscl of th count’s fac stirrd. Onc mor
Pirr lookd qustioningly at Anna Mikháylovna to s what h was to
do nxt. Anna Mikháylovna with hr ys indicatd a chair that stood
bsid th bd. Pirr obdintly sat down, his ys asking if h wr
doing right. Anna Mikháylovna noddd approvingly. Again Pirr fll
into th naïvly symmtrical pos of an gyptian statu, vidntly
distrssd that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing
his utmost to look as small as possibl. H lookd at th count, who
still gazd at th spot whr Pirr’s fac had bn bfor h sat
down. Anna Mikháylovna indicatd by hr attitud hr consciousnss of
th pathtic importanc of ths last momnts of mting btwn th
fathr and son. This lastd about two minuts, which to Pirr smd an
hour. Suddnly th broad muscls and lins of th count’s fac bgan
to twitch. Th twitching incrasd, th handsom mouth was drawn to on
sid (only now did Pirr raliz how nar dath his fathr was), and
from that distortd mouth issud an indistinct, hoars sound. Anna
Mikháylovna lookd attntivly at th sick man’s ys, trying to
guss what h wantd; sh pointd first to Pirr, thn to som drink,
thn namd Princ Vasíli in an inquiring whispr, thn pointd to th
quilt. Th ys and fac of th sick man showd impatinc. H mad an
ffort to look at th srvant who stood constantly at th had of th
bd.
“Wants to turn on th othr sid,” whisprd th srvant, and got up
to turn th count’s havy body toward th wall.
Pirr ros to hlp him.
Whil th count was bing turnd ovr, on of his arms fll back
hlplssly and h mad a fruitlss ffort to pull it forward. Whthr h
noticd th look of trror with which Pirr rgardd that liflss arm,
or whthr som othr thought flittd across his dying brain, at any
rat h glancd at th rfractory arm, at Pirr’s trror-strickn
fac, and again at th arm, and on his fac a fbl, pitous smil
appard, quit out of kping with his faturs, that smd to drid
his own hlplssnss. At sight of this smil Pirr flt an unxpctd
quivring in his brast and a tickling in his nos, and tars dimmd his
ys. Th sick man was turnd on to his sid with his fac to th wall.
H sighd.
“H is dozing,” said Anna Mikháylovna, obsrving that on of th
princsss was coming to tak hr turn at watching. “Lt us go.”
Pirr wnt out.
CHAPTR XXIV
Thr was now no on in th rcption room xcpt Princ Vasíli and th
ldst princss, who wr sitting undr th portrait of Cathrin th
Grat and talking agrly. As soon as thy saw Pirr and his companion
thy bcam silnt, and Pirr thought h saw th princss hid
somthing as sh whisprd:
“I can’t bar th sight of that woman.”
“Catich has had ta srvd in th small drawing room,” said Princ
Vasíli to Anna Mikháylovna. “Go and tak somthing, my poor Anna
Mikháylovna, or you will not hold out.”
To Pirr h said nothing, mrly giving his arm a sympathtic squz
blow th shouldr. Pirr wnt with Anna Mikháylovna into th small
drawing room.
“Thr is nothing so rfrshing aftr a slplss night as a cup
of this dlicious Russian ta,” Lorrain was saying with an air of
rstraind animation as h stood sipping ta from a dlicat Chins
handllss cup bfor a tabl on which ta and a cold suppr wr laid
in th small circular room. Around th tabl all who wr at Count
Bzúkhov’s hous that night had gathrd to fortify thmslvs.
Pirr wll rmmbrd this small circular drawing room with its mirrors
and littl tabls. During balls givn at th hous Pirr, who did not
know how to danc, had likd sitting in this room to watch th ladis
who, as thy passd through in thir ball drsss with diamonds and
parls on thir bar shouldrs, lookd at thmslvs in th brilliantly
lightd mirrors which rpatd thir rflctions svral tims. Now
this sam room was dimly lightd by two candls. On on small tabl ta
things and suppr dishs stood in disordr, and in th middl of th
night a motly throng of popl sat thr, not mrrymaking, but sombrly
whispring, and btraying by vry word and movmnt that thy non
of thm forgot what was happning and what was about to happn in th
bdroom. Pirr did not at anything though h would vry much hav
likd to. H lookd inquiringly at his monitrss and saw that sh was
again going on tipto to th rcption room whr thy had lft Princ
Vasíli and th ldst princss. Pirr concludd that this also was
ssntial, and aftr a short intrval followd hr. Anna Mikháylovna
was standing bsid th princss, and thy wr both spaking in xcitd
whisprs.
“Prmit m, Princss, to know what is ncssary and what is not
ncssary,” said th youngr of th two spakrs, vidntly in th
sam stat of xcitmnt as whn sh had slammd th door of hr room.
“But, my dar princss,” answrd Anna Mikháylovna blandly but
imprssivly, blocking th way to th bdroom and prvnting th othr
from passing, “won’t this b too much for poor Uncl at a momnt
whn h nds rpos? Worldly convrsation at a momnt whn his soul is
alrady prpard...”
Princ Vasíli was satd in an asy chair in his familiar attitud,
with on lg crossd high abov th othr. His chks, which wr so
flabby that thy lookd havir blow, wr twitching violntly; but
h wor th air of a man littl concrnd in what th two ladis wr
saying.
“Com, my dar Anna Mikháylovna, lt Catich do as sh plass. You
know how fond th count is of hr.”
“I don’t vn know what is in this papr,” said th youngr of
th two ladis, addrssing Princ Vasíli and pointing to an inlaid
portfolio sh hld in hr hand. “All I know is that his ral will is
in his writing tabl, and this is a papr h has forgottn....”
Sh trid to pass Anna Mikháylovna, but th lattr sprang so as to bar
hr path.
“I know, my dar, kind princss,” said Anna Mikháylovna, sizing
th portfolio so firmly that it was plain sh would not lt go asily.
“Dar princss, I bg and implor you, hav som pity on him! J vous
n conjur...”
Th princss did not rply. Thir fforts in th struggl for th
portfolio wr th only sounds audibl, but it was vidnt that if
th princss did spak, hr words would not b flattring to Anna
Mikháylovna. Though th lattr hld on tnaciously, hr voic lost non
of its honyd firmnss and softnss.
“Pirr, my dar, com hr. I think h will not b out of plac in a
family consultation; is it not so, Princ?”
“Why don’t you spak, cousin?” suddnly shrikd th princss so
loud that thos in th drawing room hard hr and wr startld. “Why
do you rmain silnt whn havn knows who prmits hrslf to
intrfr, making a scn on th vry thrshold of a dying man’s room?
Intrigur!” sh hissd viciously, and tuggd with all hr might at th
portfolio.
But Anna Mikháylovna wnt forward a stp or two to kp hr hold on th
portfolio, and changd hr grip.
Princ Vasíli ros. “Oh!” said h with rproach and surpris,
“this is absurd! Com, lt go I tll you.”
Th princss lt go.
“And you too!”
But Anna Mikháylovna did not oby him.
“Lt go, I tll you! I will tak th rsponsibility. I myslf will go
and ask him, I!... dos that satisfy you?”
“But, Princ,” said Anna Mikháylovna, “aftr such a solmn
sacramnt, allow him a momnt’s pac! Hr, Pirr, tll thm your
opinion,” said sh, turning to th young man who, having com quit
clos, was gazing with astonishmnt at th angry fac of th princss
which had lost all dignity, and at th twitching chks of Princ
Vasíli.
“Rmmbr that you will answr for th consquncs,” said Princ
Vasíli svrly. “You don’t know what you ar doing.”
“Vil woman!” shoutd th princss, darting unxpctdly at Anna
Mikháylovna and snatching th portfolio from hr.
Princ Vasíli bnt his had and sprad out his hands.
At this momnt that trribl door, which Pirr had watchd so long
and which had always opnd so quitly, burst noisily opn and bangd
against th wall, and th scond of th thr sistrs rushd out
wringing hr hands.
“What ar you doing!” sh crid vhmntly. “H is dying and you
lav m alon with him!”
Hr sistr droppd th portfolio. Anna Mikháylovna, stooping, quickly
caught up th objct of contntion and ran into th bdroom. Th ldst
princss and Princ Vasíli, rcovring thmslvs, followd hr. A fw
minuts latr th ldst sistr cam out with a pal hard fac, again
biting hr undrlip. At sight of Pirr hr xprssion showd an
irrprssibl hatrd.
“Ys, now you may b glad!” said sh; “this is what you hav
bn waiting for.” And bursting into tars sh hid hr fac in hr
handkrchif and rushd from th room.
Princ Vasíli cam nxt. H staggrd to th sofa on which Pirr was
sitting and droppd onto it, covring his fac with his hand. Pirr
noticd that h was pal and that his jaw quivrd and shook as if in an
agu.
“Ah, my frind!” said h, taking Pirr by th lbow; and thr was
in his voic a sincrity and waknss Pirr had nvr obsrvd in it
bfor. “How oftn w sin, how much w dciv, and all for what? I am
nar sixty, dar frind... I too... All will nd in dath, all! Dath is
awful...” and h burst into tars.
Anna Mikháylovna cam out last. Sh approachd Pirr with slow, quit
stps.
“Pirr!” sh said.
Pirr gav hr an inquiring look. Sh kissd th young man on his
forhad, wtting him with hr tars. Thn aftr a paus sh said:
“H is no mor....”
Pirr lookd at hr ovr his spctacls.
“Com, I will go with you. Try to wp, nothing givs such rlif as
tars.”
Sh ld him into th dark drawing room and Pirr was glad no on could
s his fac. Anna Mikháylovna lft him, and whn sh rturnd h was
fast aslp with his had on his arm.
In th morning Anna Mikháylovna said to Pirr:
“Ys, my dar, this is a grat loss for us all, not to spak of you.
But God will support you: you ar young, and ar now, I hop, in command
of an immns fortun. Th will has not yt bn opnd. I know you
wll nough to b sur that this will not turn your had, but it imposs
dutis on you, and you must b a man.”
Pirr was silnt.
“Prhaps latr on I may tll you, my dar boy, that if I had not bn
thr, God only knows what would hav happnd! You know, Uncl promisd
m only th day bfor ystrday not to forgt Borís. But h had
no tim. I hop, my dar frind, you will carry out your fathr’s
wish?”
Pirr undrstood nothing of all this and coloring shyly lookd in
silnc at Princss Anna Mikháylovna. Aftr hr talk with Pirr, Anna
Mikháylovna rturnd to th Rostóvs’ and wnt to bd. On waking in
th morning sh told th Rostóvs and all hr acquaintancs th dtails
of Count Bzúkhov’s dath. Sh said th count had did as sh would
hrslf wish to di, that his nd was not only touching but difying. As
to th last mting btwn fathr and son, it was so touching that sh
could not think of it without tars, and did not know which had bhavd
bttr during thos awful momnts—th fathr who so rmmbrd
vrything and vrybody at last and had spokn such pathtic words to
th son, or Pirr, whom it had bn pitiful to s, so strickn was h
with grif, though h trid hard to hid it in ordr not to saddn his
dying fathr. “It is painful, but it dos on good. It uplifts th
soul to s such mn as th old count and his worthy son,” said sh.
Of th bhavior of th ldst princss and Princ Vasíli sh spok
disapprovingly, but in whisprs and as a grat scrt.
CHAPTR XXV
At Bald Hills, Princ Nicholas Andrvich Bolkónski’s stat, th
arrival of young Princ Andrw and his wif was daily xpctd, but
this xpctation did not upst th rgular routin of lif in th old
princ’s houshold. Gnral in Chif Princ Nicholas Andrvich
(nicknamd in socity, “th King of Prussia”) vr sinc th mpror
Paul had xild him to his country stat had livd thr continuously
with his daughtr, Princss Mary, and hr companion, Madmoisll
Bourinn. Though in th nw rign h was fr to rturn to th
capitals, h still continud to liv in th country, rmarking that
anyon who wantd to s him could com th hundrd mils from Moscow to
Bald Hills, whil h himslf ndd no on and nothing. H usd to
say that thr ar only two sourcs of human vic—idlnss and
suprstition, and only two virtus—activity and intllignc. H
himslf undrtook his daughtr’s ducation, and to dvlop ths two
cardinal virtus in hr gav hr lssons in algbra and gomtry
till sh was twnty, and arrangd hr lif so that hr whol tim was
occupid. H was himslf always occupid: writing his mmoirs, solving
problms in highr mathmatics, turning snuffboxs on a lath, working
in th gardn, or suprintnding th building that was always going on
at his stat. As rgularity is a prim condition facilitating activity,
rgularity in his houshold was carrid to th highst point of
xactitud. H always cam to tabl undr prcisly th sam conditions,
and not only at th sam hour but at th sam minut. With thos about
him, from his daughtr to his srfs, th princ was sharp and invariably
xacting, so that without bing a hardhartd man h inspird such far
and rspct as fw hardhartd mn would hav arousd. Although h was
in rtirmnt and had now no influnc in political affairs, vry high
official appointd to th provinc in which th princ’s stat lay
considrd it his duty to visit him and waitd in th lofty antchambr
just as th architct, gardnr, or Princss Mary did, till th princ
appard punctually to th appointd hour. vryon sitting in this
antchambr xprincd th sam fling of rspct and vn far whn
th normously high study door opnd and showd th figur of a rathr
small old man, with powdrd wig, small withrd hands, and bushy gray
ybrows which, whn h frownd, somtims hid th glam of his shrwd,
youthfully glittring ys.
On th morning of th day that th young coupl wr to arriv, Princss
Mary ntrd th antchambr as usual at th tim appointd for th
morning grting, crossing hrslf with trpidation and rpating a
silnt prayr. vry morning sh cam in lik that, and vry morning
prayd that th daily intrviw might pass off wll.
An old powdrd mansrvant who was sitting in th antchambr ros
quitly and said in a whispr: “Plas walk in.”
Through th door cam th rgular hum of a lath. Th princss timidly
opnd th door which movd noislssly and asily. Sh pausd at th
ntranc. Th princ was working at th lath and aftr glancing round
continud his work.
Th normous study was full of things vidntly in constant us.
Th larg tabl covrd with books and plans, th tall glass-frontd
bookcass with kys in th locks, th high dsk for writing whil
standing up, on which lay an opn xrcis book, and th lath with
tools laid rady to hand and shavings scattrd around—all indicatd
continuous, varid, and ordrly activity. Th motion of th small foot
shod in a Tartar boot mbroidrd with silvr, and th firm prssur
of th lan sinwy hand, showd that th princ still possssd th
tnacious nduranc and vigor of hardy old ag. Aftr a fw mor turns
of th lath h rmovd his foot from th pdal, wipd his chisl,
droppd it into a lathr pouch attachd to th lath, and, approaching
th tabl, summond his daughtr. H nvr gav his childrn a blssing,
so h simply hld out his bristly chk (as yt unshavn) and, rgarding
hr tndrly and attntivly, said svrly:
“Quit wll? All right thn, sit down.” H took th xrcis book
containing lssons in gomtry writtn by himslf and drw up a chair
with his foot.
“For tomorrow!” said h, quickly finding th pag and making a
scratch from on paragraph to anothr with his hard nail.
Th princss bnt ovr th xrcis book on th tabl.
“Wait a bit, hr’s a lttr for you,” said th old man suddnly,
taking a lttr addrssd in a woman’s hand from a bag hanging abov
th tabl, onto which h thrw it.
At th sight of th lttr rd patchs showd thmslvs on th
princss’ fac. Sh took it quickly and bnt hr had ovr it.
“From Hloïs?” askd th princ with a cold smil that showd his
still sound, yllowish tth.
“Ys, it’s from Juli,” rplid th princss with a timid glanc
and a timid smil.
“I’ll lt two mor lttrs pass, but th third I’ll rad,” said
th princ strnly; “I’m afraid you writ much nonsns. I’ll rad
th third!”
“Rad this if you lik, Fathr,” said th princss, blushing still
mor and holding out th lttr.
“Th third, I said th third!” crid th princ abruptly, pushing
th lttr away, and laning his lbows on th tabl h drw toward him
th xrcis book containing gomtrical figurs.
“Wll, madam,” h bgan, stooping ovr th book clos to his
daughtr and placing an arm on th back of th chair on which sh sat,
so that sh flt hrslf surroundd on all sids by th acrid scnt of
old ag and tobacco, which sh had known so long. “Now, madam, ths
triangls ar qual; plas not that th angl ABC...”
Th princss lookd in a scard way at hr fathr’s ys glittring
clos to hr; th rd patchs on hr fac cam and wnt, and it was
plain that sh undrstood nothing and was so frightnd that hr
far would prvnt hr undrstanding any of hr fathr’s furthr
xplanations, howvr clar thy might b. Whthr it was th
tachr’s fault or th pupil’s, this sam thing happnd vry day:
th princss’ ys grw dim, sh could not s and could not har
anything, but was only conscious of hr strn fathr’s withrd fac
clos to hr, of his brath and th smll of him, and could think only
of how to gt away quickly to hr own room to mak out th problm in
pac. Th old man was bsid himslf: movd th chair on which h was
sitting noisily backward and forward, mad fforts to control himslf
and not bcom vhmnt, but almost always did bcom vhmnt, scoldd,
and somtims flung th xrcis book away.
Th princss gav a wrong answr.
“Wll now, isn’t sh a fool!” shoutd th princ, pushing th book
asid and turning sharply away; but rising immdiatly, h pacd up and
down, lightly touchd his daughtr’s hair and sat down again.
H drw up his chair, and continud to xplain.
“This won’t do, Princss; it won’t do,” said h, whn Princss
Mary, having takn and closd th xrcis book with th nxt day’s
lsson, was about to lav: “Mathmatics ar most important, madam!
I don’t want to hav you lik our silly ladis. Gt usd to it and
you’ll lik it,” and h pattd hr chk. “It will driv all th
nonsns out of your had.”
Sh turnd to go, but h stoppd hr with a gstur and took an uncut
book from th high dsk.
“Hr is som sort of Ky to th Mystris that your Hloïs has
snt you. Rligious! I don’t intrfr with anyon’s blif... I
hav lookd at it. Tak it. Wll, now go. Go.”
H pattd hr on th shouldr and himslf closd th door aftr hr.
Princss Mary wnt back to hr room with th sad, scard xprssion that
rarly lft hr and which mad hr plain, sickly fac yt plainr. Sh
sat down at hr writing tabl, on which stood miniatur portraits and
which was littrd with books and paprs. Th princss was as untidy as
hr fathr was tidy. Sh put down th gomtry book and agrly brok
th sal of hr lttr. It was from hr most intimat frind from
childhood; that sam Juli Karágina who had bn at th Rostóvs’
nam-day party.
Juli wrot in Frnch:
Dar and prcious Frind, How trribl and frightful a thing is
sparation! Though I tll myslf that half my lif and half my happinss
ar wrappd up in you, and that in spit of th distanc sparating us
our harts ar unitd by indissolubl bonds, my hart rbls against
fat and in spit of th plasurs and distractions around m I cannot
ovrcom a crtain scrt sorrow that has bn in my hart vr sinc
w partd. Why ar w not togthr as w wr last summr, in your big
study, on th blu sofa, th confidntial sofa? Why cannot I now, as
thr months ago, draw frsh moral strngth from your look, so gntl,
calm, and pntrating, a look I lovd so wll and sm to s bfor m
as I writ?
Having rad thus far, Princss Mary sighd and glancd into th mirror
which stood on hr right. It rflctd a wak, ungracful figur and
thin fac. Hr ys, always sad, now lookd with particular hoplssnss
at hr rflction in th glass. “Sh flattrs m,” thought th
princss, turning away and continuing to rad. But Juli did not flattr
hr frind, th princss’ ys—larg, dp and luminous (it smd
as if at tims thr radiatd from thm shafts of warm light)—wr
so bautiful that vry oftn in spit of th plainnss of hr fac
thy gav hr an attraction mor powrful than that of bauty. But th
princss nvr saw th bautiful xprssion of hr own ys—th look
thy had whn sh was not thinking of hrslf. As with vryon, hr
fac assumd a forcd unnatural xprssion as soon as sh lookd in a
glass. Sh wnt on rading:
All Moscow talks of nothing but war. On of my two brothrs is alrady
abroad, th othr is with th Guards, who ar starting on thir march
to th frontir. Our dar mpror has lft Ptrsburg and it is thought
intnds to xpos his prcious prson to th chancs of war. God grant
that th Corsican monstr who is dstroying th pac of urop may
b ovrthrown by th angl whom it has plasd th Almighty, in His
goodnss, to giv us as sovrign! To say nothing of my brothrs, this
war has dprivd m of on of th associations narst my hart. I man
young Nicholas Rostóv, who with his nthusiasm could not bar to rmain
inactiv and has lft th univrsity to join th army. I will confss to
you, dar Mary, that in spit of his xtrm youth his dpartur for
th army was a grat grif to m. This young man, of whom I spok to you
last summr, is so nobl-mindd and full of that ral youthfulnss which
on sldom finds nowadays among our old mn of twnty and, particularly,
h is so frank and has so much hart. H is so pur and potic that
my rlations with him, transint as thy wr, hav bn on of th
swtst comforts to my poor hart, which has alrady suffrd so much.
Somday I will tll you about our parting and all that was said thn.
That is still too frsh. Ah, dar frind, you ar happy not to know
ths poignant joys and sorrows. You ar fortunat, for th lattr ar
gnrally th strongr! I know vry wll that Count Nicholas is too
young vr to b mor to m than a frind, but this swt frindship,
this potic and pur intimacy, wr what my hart ndd. But nough of
this! Th chif nws, about which all Moscow gossips, is th dath of
old Count Bzúkhov, and his inhritanc. Fancy! Th thr princsss
hav rcivd vry littl, Princ Vasíli nothing, and it is Monsiur
Pirr who has inhritd all th proprty and has bsids bn
rcognizd as lgitimat; so that h is now Count Bzúkhov and
possssor of th finst fortun in Russia. It is rumord that Princ
Vasíli playd a vry dspicabl part in this affair and that h
rturnd to Ptrsburg quit crstfalln.
I confss I undrstand vry littl about all ths mattrs of wills and
inhritanc; but I do know that sinc this young man, whom w all usd
to know as plain Monsiur Pirr, has bcom Count Bzúkhov and th
ownr of on of th largst fortuns in Russia, I am much amusd to
watch th chang in th ton and mannrs of th mammas burdnd by
marriagabl daughtrs, and of th young ladis thmslvs, toward
him, though, btwn you and m, h always smd to m a poor sort
of fllow. As for th past two yars popl hav amusd thmslvs
by finding husbands for m (most of whom I don’t vn know), th
matchmaking chronicls of Moscow now spak of m as th futur Countss
Bzúkhova. But you will undrstand that I hav no dsir for th post.
À propos of marriags: do you know that a whil ago that univrsal
aunti Anna Mikháylovna told m, undr th sal of strict scrcy, of
a plan of marriag for you. It is nithr mor nor lss than with Princ
Vasíli’s son Anatol, whom thy wish to rform by marrying him to
somon rich and distingu, and it is on you that his rlations’
choic has falln. I don’t know what you will think of it, but
I considr it my duty to lt you know of it. H is said to b vry
handsom and a trribl scapgrac. That is all I hav bn abl to find
out about him.
But nough of gossip. I am at th nd of my scond sht of papr, and
Mamma has snt for m to go and din at th Apráksins’. Rad th
mystical book I am snding you; it has an normous succss hr. Though
thr ar things in it difficult for th fbl human mind to grasp, it
is an admirabl book which calms and lvats th soul. Adiu! Giv
my rspcts to monsiur your fathr and my complimnts to Madmoisll
Bourinn. I mbrac you as I lov you.
JULI
P.S. Lt m hav nws of your brothr and his charming littl wif.
Th princss pondrd awhil with a thoughtful smil and hr luminous
ys lit up so that hr fac was ntirly transformd. Thn sh suddnly
ros and with hr havy trad wnt up to th tabl. Sh took a sht of
papr and hr hand movd rapidly ovr it. This is th rply sh wrot,
also in Frnch:
Dar and prcious Frind, Your lttr of th 13th has givn m grat
dlight. So you still lov m, my romantic Juli? Sparation, of which
you say so much that is bad, dos not sm to hav had its usual ffct
on you. You complain of our sparation. What thn should I say, if I
dard complain, I who am dprivd of all who ar dar to m? Ah, if
w had not rligion to consol us lif would b vry sad. Why do you
suppos that I should look svrly on your affction for that young
man? On such mattrs I am only svr with myslf. I undrstand such
flings in othrs, and if nvr having flt thm I cannot approv of
thm, nithr do I condmn thm. Only it sms to m that Christian
lov, lov of on’s nighbor, lov of on’s nmy, is worthir,
swtr, and bttr than th flings which th bautiful ys of a
young man can inspir in a romantic and loving young girl lik yourslf.
Th nws of Count Bzúkhov’s dath rachd us bfor your lttr
and my fathr was much affctd by it. H says th count was th last
rprsntativ but on of th grat cntury, and that it is his own
turn now, but that h will do all h can to lt his turn com as lat as
possibl. God prsrv us from that trribl misfortun!
I cannot agr with you about Pirr, whom I knw as a child. H always
smd to m to hav an xcllnt hart, and that is th quality I valu
most in popl. As to his inhritanc and th part playd by Princ
Vasíli, it is vry sad for both. Ah, my dar frind, our divin
Saviour’s words, that it is asir for a caml to go through th
y of a ndl than for a rich man to ntr th Kingdom of God, ar
trribly tru. I pity Princ Vasíli but am still mor sorry for Pirr.
So young, and burdnd with such richs—to what tmptations h will b
xposd! If I wr askd what I dsir most on arth, it would b to b
poorr than th poorst bggar. A thousand thanks, dar frind, for th
volum you hav snt m and which has such succss in Moscow. Yt sinc
you tll m that among som good things it contains othrs which our
wak human undrstanding cannot grasp, it sms to m rathr uslss to
spnd tim in rading what is unintlligibl and can thrfor bar
no fruit. I nvr could undrstand th fondnss som popl hav for
confusing thir minds by dwlling on mystical books that mrly awakn
thir doubts and xcit thir imagination, giving thm a bnt for
xaggration quit contrary to Christian simplicity. Lt us rathr rad
th pistls and Gospls. Lt us not sk to pntrat what mystris
thy contain; for how can w, misrabl sinnrs that w ar, know th
trribl and holy scrts of Providnc whil w rmain in this flsh
which forms an impntrabl vil btwn us and th trnal? Lt us
rathr confin ourslvs to studying thos sublim ruls which our
divin Saviour has lft for our guidanc hr blow. Lt us try to
conform to thm and follow thm, and lt us b prsuadd that th lss
w lt our fbl human minds roam, th bttr w shall plas God, who
rjcts all knowldg that dos not com from Him; and th lss w sk
to fathom what H has bn plasd to concal from us, th soonr will
H vouchsaf its rvlation to us through His divin Spirit.
My fathr has not spokn to m of a suitor, but has only told m that h
has rcivd a lttr and is xpcting a visit from Princ Vasíli. In
rgard to this projct of marriag for m, I will tll you, dar swt
frind, that I look on marriag as a divin institution to which w must
conform. Howvr painful it may b to m, should th Almighty lay
th dutis of wif and mothr upon m I shall try to prform thm as
faithfully as I can, without disquiting myslf by xamining my flings
toward him whom H may giv m for husband.
I hav had a lttr from my brothr, who announcs his spdy arrival
at Bald Hills with his wif. This plasur will b but a brif on,
howvr, for h will lav us again to tak part in this unhappy war
into which w hav bn drawn, God knows how or why. Not only whr you
ar—at th hart of affairs and of th world—is th talk all of
war, vn hr amid fildwork and th calm of natur—which townsfolk
considr charactristic of th country—rumors of war ar hard
and painfully flt. My fathr talks of nothing but marchs and
countrmarchs, things of which I undrstand nothing; and th day
bfor ystrday during my daily walk through th villag I witnssd a
hartrnding scn.... It was a convoy of conscripts nrolld from our
popl and starting to join th army. You should hav sn th stat of
th mothrs, wivs, and childrn of th mn who wr going and should
hav hard th sobs. It sms as though mankind has forgottn th
laws of its divin Saviour, Who prachd lov and forgivnss of
injuris—and that mn attribut th gratst mrit to skill in killing
on anothr.
Adiu, dar and kind frind; may our divin Saviour and His most Holy
Mothr kp you in thir holy and all-powrful car!

“Ah, you ar snding off a lttr, Princss? I hav alrady dispatchd
min. I hav writtn to my poor mothr,” said th smiling Madmoisll
Bourinn rapidly, in hr plasant mllow tons and with guttural r’s.
Sh brought into Princss Mary’s strnuous, mournful, and gloomy
world a quit diffrnt atmosphr, carlss, lighthartd, and
slf-satisfid.
“Princss, I must warn you,” sh addd, lowring hr voic and
vidntly listning to hrslf with plasur, and spaking with
xaggratd grassymnt, “th princ has bn scolding Michal
Ivánovich. H is in a vry bad humor, vry moros. B prpard.”
“Ah, dar frind,” rplid Princss Mary, “I hav askd you nvr
to warn m of th humor my fathr is in. I do not allow myslf to judg
him and would not hav othrs do so.”
Th princss glancd at hr watch and, sing that sh was fiv minuts
lat in starting hr practic on th clavichord, wnt into th sitting
room with a look of alarm. Btwn twlv and two o’clock, as th
day was mappd out, th princ rstd and th princss playd th
clavichord.
CHAPTR XXVI
Th gray-haird valt was sitting drowsily listning to th snoring of
th princ, who was in his larg study. From th far sid of th hous
through th closd doors cam th sound of difficult passags—twnty
tims rpatd—of a sonata by Dussk.
Just thn a closd carriag and anothr with a hood drov up to th
porch. Princ Andrw got out of th carriag, hlpd his littl wif to
alight, and lt hr pass into th hous bfor him. Old Tíkhon, waring
a wig, put his had out of th door of th antchambr, rportd in
a whispr that th princ was slping, and hastily closd th door.
Tíkhon knw that nithr th son’s arrival nor any othr unusual
vnt must b allowd to disturb th appointd ordr of th day. Princ
Andrw apparntly knw this as wll as Tíkhon; h lookd at his watch
as if to ascrtain whthr his fathr’s habits had changd sinc h
was at hom last, and, having assurd himslf that thy had not, h
turnd to his wif.
“H will gt up in twnty minuts. Lt us go across to Mary’s
room,” h said.
Th littl princss had grown stoutr during this tim, but hr ys
and hr short, downy, smiling lip liftd whn sh bgan to spak just as
mrrily and prttily as vr.
“Why, this is a palac!” sh said to hr husband, looking around
with th xprssion with which popl complimnt thir host at a ball.
“Lt’s com, quick, quick!” And with a glanc round, sh smild at
Tíkhon, at hr husband, and at th footman who accompanid thm.
“Is that Mary practicing? Lt’s go quitly and tak hr by
surpris.”
Princ Andrw followd hr with a courtous but sad xprssion.
“You’v grown oldr, Tíkhon,” h said in passing to th old man,
who kissd his hand.
Bfor thy rachd th room from which th sounds of th clavichord
cam, th prtty, fair-haird Frnchwoman, Madmoisll Bourinn,
rushd out apparntly bsid hrslf with dlight.
“Ah! what joy for th princss!” xclaimd sh: “At last! I must
lt hr know.”
“No, no, plas not... You ar Madmoisll Bourinn,” said
th littl princss, kissing hr. “I know you alrady through my
sistr-in-law’s frindship for you. Sh was not xpcting us?”
Thy wnt up to th door of th sitting room from which cam th sound
of th oft-rpatd passag of th sonata. Princ Andrw stoppd and
mad a grimac, as if xpcting somthing unplasant.
Th littl princss ntrd th room. Th passag brok off in th
middl, a cry was hard, thn Princss Mary’s havy trad and th
sound of kissing. Whn Princ Andrw wnt in th two princsss, who
had only mt onc bfor for a short tim at his wdding, wr in
ach othr’s arms warmly prssing thir lips to whatvr plac thy
happnd to touch. Madmoisll Bourinn stood nar thm prssing hr
hand to hr hart, with a batific smil and obviously qually rady to
cry or to laugh. Princ Andrw shruggd his shouldrs and frownd, as
lovrs of music do whn thy har a fals not. Th two womn lt go
of on anothr, and thn, as if afraid of bing too lat, sizd ach
othr’s hands, kissing thm and pulling thm away, and again bgan
kissing ach othr on th fac, and thn to Princ Andrw’s surpris
both bgan to cry and kissd again. Madmoisll Bourinn also bgan to
cry. Princ Andrw vidntly flt ill at as, but to th two womn
it smd quit natural that thy should cry, and apparntly it nvr
ntrd thir hads that it could hav bn othrwis at this mting.
“Ah! my dar!... Ah! Mary!...” thy suddnly xclaimd, and thn
laughd. “I dramd last night...”—“You wr not xpcting
us?...” “Ah! Mary, you hav got thinnr?...” “And you hav grown
stoutr!...”
“I knw th princss at onc,” put in Madmoisll Bourinn.
“And I had no ida!...” xclaimd Princss Mary. “Ah, Andrw, I
did not s you.”
Princ Andrw and his sistr, hand in hand, kissd on anothr, and
h told hr sh was still th sam crybaby as vr. Princss Mary had
turnd toward hr brothr, and through hr tars th loving, warm,
gntl look of hr larg luminous ys, vry bautiful at that momnt,
rstd on Princ Andrw’s fac.
Th littl princss talkd incssantly, hr short, downy uppr lip
continually and rapidly touching hr rosy nthr lip whn ncssary
and drawing up again nxt momnt whn hr fac brok into a smil of
glittring tth and sparkling ys. Sh told of an accidnt thy had
had on th Spásski Hill which might hav bn srious for hr in hr
condition, and immdiatly aftr that informd thm that sh had lft
all hr cloths in Ptrsburg and that havn knw what sh would hav
to drss in hr; and that Andrw had quit changd, and that Kitty
Odýntsova had marrid an old man, and that thr was a suitor for Mary,
a ral on, but that thy would talk of that latr. Princss Mary was
still looking silntly at hr brothr and hr bautiful ys wr full
of lov and sadnss. It was plain that sh was following a train of
thought indpndnt of hr sistr-in-law’s words. In th midst of a
dscription of th last Ptrsburg ft sh addrssd hr brothr:
“So you ar rally going to th war, Andrw?” sh said sighing.
Lis sighd too.
“Ys, and vn tomorrow,” rplid hr brothr.
“H is laving m hr, God knows why, whn h might hav had
promotion...”
Princss Mary did not listn to th nd, but continuing hr train of
thought turnd to hr sistr-in-law with a tndr glanc at hr figur.
“Is it crtain?” sh said.
Th fac of th littl princss changd. Sh sighd and said: “Ys,
quit crtain. Ah! it is vry dradful...”
Hr lip dscndd. Sh brought hr fac clos to hr sistr-in-law’s
and unxpctdly again bgan to cry.
“Sh nds rst,” said Princ Andrw with a frown. “Don’t you,
Lis? Tak hr to your room and I’ll go to Fathr. How is h? Just th
sam?”
“Ys, just th sam. Though I don’t know what your opinion will
b,” answrd th princss joyfully.
“And ar th hours th sam? And th walks in th avnus? And th
lath?” askd Princ Andrw with a scarcly prcptibl smil which
showd that, in spit of all his lov and rspct for his fathr, h was
awar of his waknsss.
“Th hours ar th sam, and th lath, and also th mathmatics and
my gomtry lssons,” said Princss Mary glfully, as if hr lssons
in gomtry wr among th gratst dlights of hr lif.
Whn th twnty minuts had lapsd and th tim had com for th old
princ to gt up, Tíkhon cam to call th young princ to his fathr.
Th old man mad a dpartur from his usual routin in honor of his
son’s arrival: h gav ordrs to admit him to his apartmnts whil
h drssd for dinnr. Th old princ always drssd in old-fashiond
styl, waring an antiqu coat and powdrd hair; and whn Princ Andrw
ntrd his fathr’s drssing room (not with th contmptuous look and
mannr h wor in drawing rooms, but with th animatd fac with which
h talkd to Pirr), th old man was sitting on a larg lathr-covrd
chair, wrappd in a powdring mantl, ntrusting his had to Tíkhon.
“Ah! hr’s th warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonapart?” said th
old man, shaking his powdrd had as much as th tail, which Tíkhon
was holding fast to plait, would allow.
“You at last must tackl him proprly, or ls if h gos on lik
this h’ll soon hav us, too, for his subjcts! How ar you?” And h
hld out his chk.
Th old man was in a good tmpr aftr his nap bfor dinnr. (H
usd to say that a nap “aftr dinnr was silvr—bfor dinnr,
goldn.”) H cast happy, sidlong glancs at his son from undr his
thick, bushy ybrows. Princ Andrw wnt up and kissd his fathr on
th spot indicatd to him. H mad no rply on his fathr’s favorit
topic—making fun of th military mn of th day, and mor particularly
of Bonapart.
“Ys, Fathr, I hav com to you and brought my wif who is
prgnant,” said Princ Andrw, following vry movmnt of his
fathr’s fac with an agr and rspctful look. “How is your
halth?”
“Only fools and raks fall ill, my boy. You know m: I am busy from
morning till night and abstmious, so of cours I am wll.”
“Thank God,” said his son smiling.
“God has nothing to do with it! Wll, go on,” h continud,
rturning to his hobby; “tll m how th Grmans hav taught you to
fight Bonapart by this nw scinc you call ‘stratgy.’”
Princ Andrw smild.
“Giv m tim to collct my wits, Fathr,” said h, with a smil
that showd that his fathr’s foibls did not prvnt his son from
loving and honoring him. “Why, I hav not yt had tim to sttl
down!”
“Nonsns, nonsns!” crid th old man, shaking his pigtail to
s whthr it was firmly plaitd, and grasping his by th hand. “Th
hous for your wif is rady. Princss Mary will tak hr thr and
show hr ovr, and thy’ll talk nintn to th dozn. That’s
thir woman’s way! I am glad to hav hr. Sit down and talk. About
Mikhlson’s army I undrstand—Tolstóy ‘s too... a simultanous
xpdition.... But what’s th southrn army to do? Prussia is
nutral... I know that. What about Austria?” said h, rising from his
chair and pacing up and down th room followd by Tíkhon, who ran aftr
him, handing him diffrnt articls of clothing. “What of Swdn? How
will thy cross Pomrania?”
Princ Andrw, sing that his fathr insistd, bgan—at first
rluctantly, but gradually with mor and mor animation, and from habit
changing unconsciously from Russian to Frnch as h wnt on—to xplain
th plan of opration for th coming campaign. H xplaind how an army,
ninty thousand strong, was to thratn Prussia so as to bring hr out
of hr nutrality and draw hr into th war; how part of that army was
to join som Swdish forcs at Stralsund; how two hundrd and twnty
thousand Austrians, with a hundrd thousand Russians, wr to oprat in
Italy and on th Rhin; how fifty thousand Russians and as many nglish
wr to land at Napls, and how a total forc of fiv hundrd thousand
mn was to attack th Frnch from diffrnt sids. Th old princ did
not vinc th last intrst during this xplanation, but as if h wr
not listning to it continud to drss whil walking about, and thr
tims unxpctdly intrruptd. Onc h stoppd it by shouting: “Th
whit on, th whit on!”
This mant that Tíkhon was not handing him th waistcoat h wantd.
Anothr tim h intrruptd, saying:
“And will sh soon b confind?” and shaking his had rproachfully
said: “That’s bad! Go on, go on.”
Th third intrruption cam whn Princ Andrw was finishing his
dscription. Th old man bgan to sing, in th crackd voic of old ag:
“Malbrook s’n va-t-n gurr. Diu sait quand rvindra.” *
     * “Marlborough is going to th wars; God knows whn h’ll
     rturn.”
His son only smild.
“I don’t say it’s a plan I approv of,” said th son; “I am
only tlling you what it is. Napolon has also formd his plan by now,
not wors than this on.”
“Wll, you’v told m nothing nw,” and th old man rpatd,
mditativly and rapidly:
“Diu sait quand rvindra. Go to th dining room.”
CHAPTR XXVII
At th appointd hour th princ, powdrd and shavn, ntrd th
dining room whr his daughtr-in-law, Princss Mary, and Madmoisll
Bourinn wr alrady awaiting him togthr with his architct, who by
a strang capric of his mployr’s was admittd to tabl though th
position of that insignificant individual was such as could crtainly
not hav causd him to xpct that honor. Th princ, who gnrally kpt
vry strictly to social distinctions and rarly admittd vn important
govrnmnt officials to his tabl, had unxpctdly slctd Michal
Ivánovich (who always wnt into a cornr to blow his nos on his
chckd handkrchif) to illustrat th thory that all mn ar quals,
and had mor than onc imprssd on his daughtr that Michal Ivánovich
was “not a whit wors than you or I.” At dinnr th princ usually
spok to th taciturn Michal Ivánovich mor oftn than to anyon ls.
In th dining room, which lik all th rooms in th hous was
xcdingly lofty, th mmbrs of th houshold and th footmn—on
bhind ach chair—stood waiting for th princ to ntr. Th had
butlr, napkin on arm, was scanning th stting of th tabl, making
signs to th footmn, and anxiously glancing from th clock to th door
by which th princ was to ntr. Princ Andrw was looking at a larg
gilt fram, nw to him, containing th gnalogical tr of th Princs
Bolkónski, opposit which hung anothr such fram with a badly paintd
portrait (vidntly by th hand of th artist blonging to th stat)
of a ruling princ, in a crown—an allgd dscndant of Rúrik and
ancstor of th Bolkónskis. Princ Andrw, looking again at that
gnalogical tr, shook his had, laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so charactristic of th original as to b amusing.
“How thoroughly lik him that is!” h said to Princss Mary, who had
com up to him.
Princss Mary lookd at hr brothr in surpris. Sh did not undrstand
what h was laughing at. vrything hr fathr did inspird hr with
rvrnc and was byond qustion.
“vryon has his Achills’ hl,” continud Princ Andrw.
“Fancy, with his powrful mind, indulging in such nonsns!”
Princss Mary could not undrstand th boldnss of hr brothr’s
criticism and was about to rply, whn th xpctd footstps wr hard
coming from th study. Th princ walkd in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont, as if intntionally contrasting th brisknss of his mannrs
with th strict formality of his hous. At that momnt th grat clock
struck two and anothr with a shrill ton joind in from th drawing
room. Th princ stood still; his livly glittring ys from undr
thir thick, bushy ybrows strnly scannd all prsnt and rstd on
th littl princss. Sh flt, as courtirs do whn th Tsar ntrs, th
snsation of far and rspct which th old man inspird in all around
him. H strokd hr hair and thn pattd hr awkwardly on th back of
hr nck.
“I’m glad, glad, to s you,” h said, looking attntivly into
hr ys, and thn quickly wnt to his plac and sat down. “Sit down,
sit down! Sit down, Michal Ivánovich!”
H indicatd a plac bsid him to his daughtr-in-law. A footman movd
th chair for hr.
“Ho, ho!” said th old man, casting his ys on hr roundd figur.
“You’v bn in a hurry. That’s bad!”
H laughd in his usual dry, cold, unplasant way, with his lips only
and not with his ys.
“You must walk, walk as much as possibl, as much as possibl,” h
said.
Th littl princss did not, or did not wish to, har his words. Sh was
silnt and smd confusd. Th princ askd hr about hr fathr, and
sh bgan to smil and talk. H askd about mutual acquaintancs, and
sh bcam still mor animatd and chattrd away giving him grtings
from various popl and rtlling th town gossip.
“Countss Apráksina, poor thing, has lost hr husband and sh has
crid hr ys out,” sh said, growing mor and mor livly.
As sh bcam animatd th princ lookd at hr mor and mor strnly,
and suddnly, as if h had studid hr sufficintly and had formd a
dfinit ida of hr, h turnd away and addrssd Michal Ivánovich.
“Wll, Michal Ivánovich, our Bonapart will b having a bad tim
of it. Princ Andrw” (h always spok thus of his son) “has bn
tlling m what forcs ar bing collctd against him! Whil you and I
nvr thought much of him.”
Michal Ivánovich did not at all know whn “you and I” had said
such things about Bonapart, but undrstanding that h was wantd as
a pg on which to hang th princ’s favorit topic, h lookd
inquiringly at th young princ, wondring what would follow.
“H is a grat tactician!” said th princ to his son, pointing to
th architct.
And th convrsation again turnd on th war, on Bonapart, and th
gnrals and statsmn of th day. Th old princ smd convincd not
only that all th mn of th day wr mr babis who did not know th
A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonapart was an insignificant
littl Frnchy, succssful only bcaus thr wr no longr any
Potëmkins or Suvórovs lft to oppos him; but h was also convincd
that thr wr no political difficultis in urop and no ral war,
but only a sort of puppt show at which th mn of th day wr playing,
prtnding to do somthing ral. Princ Andrw gaily bor with his
fathr’s ridicul of th nw mn, and drw him on and listnd to him
with vidnt plasur.
“Th past always sms good,” said h, “but did not Suvórov
himslf fall into a trap Morau st him, and from which h did not know
how to scap?”
“Who told you that? Who?” crid th princ. “Suvórov!” And h
jrkd away his plat, which Tíkhon briskly caught. “Suvórov!...
Considr, Princ Andrw. Two... Frdrick and Suvórov; Morau!...
Morau would hav bn a prisonr if Suvórov had had a fr hand; but
h had th Hofs-krigs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would hav
puzzld th dvil himslf! Whn you gt thr you’ll find out what
thos Hofs-krigs-wurst-Raths ar! Suvórov couldn’t manag thm so
what chanc has Michal Kutúzov? No, my dar boy,” h continud,
“you and your gnrals won’t gt on against Buonapart; you’ll
hav to call in th Frnch, so that birds of a fathr may fight
togthr. Th Grman, Pahln, has bn snt to Nw York in Amrica, to
ftch th Frnchman, Morau,” h said, alluding to th invitation mad
that yar to Morau to ntr th Russian srvic.... “Wondrful!...
Wr th Potëmkins, Suvórovs, and Orlóvs Grmans? No, lad, ithr you
fllows hav all lost your wits, or I hav outlivd min. May God hlp
you, but w’ll s what will happn. Buonapart has bcom a grat
commandr among thm! Hm!...”
“I don’t at all say that all th plans ar good,” said Princ
Andrw, “I am only surprisd at your opinion of Bonapart. You
may laugh as much as you lik, but all th sam Bonapart is a grat
gnral!”
“Michal Ivánovich!” crid th old princ to th architct who,
busy with his roast mat, hopd h had bn forgottn: “Didn’t
I tll you Buonapart was a grat tactician? Hr, h says th sam
thing.”
“To b sur, your xcllncy,” rplid th architct.
Th princ again laughd his frigid laugh.
“Buonapart was born with a silvr spoon in his mouth. H has got
splndid soldirs. Bsids h bgan by attacking Grmans. And only
idlrs hav faild to bat th Grmans. Sinc th world bgan vrybody
has batn th Grmans. Thy bat no on—xcpt on anothr. H mad
his rputation fighting thm.”
And th princ bgan xplaining all th blundrs which, according to
him, Bonapart had mad in his campaigns and vn in politics. His
son mad no rjoindr, but it was vidnt that whatvr argumnts wr
prsntd h was as littl abl as his fathr to chang his opinion. H
listnd, rfraining from a rply, and involuntarily wondrd how this
old man, living alon in th country for so many yars, could know and
discuss so minutly and acutly all th rcnt uropan military and
political vnts.
“You think I’m an old man and don’t undrstand th prsnt stat
of affairs?” concludd his fathr. “But it troubls m. I don’t
slp at night. Com now, whr has this grat commandr of yours shown
his skill?” h concludd.
“That would tak too long to tll,” answrd th son.
“Wll, thn go off to your Buonapart! Madmoisll Bourinn,
hr’s anothr admirr of that powdr-monky mpror of yours,” h
xclaimd in xcllnt Frnch.
“You know, Princ, I am not a Bonapartist!”
“Diu sait quand rvindra.” hummd th princ out of tun and, with
a laugh still mor so, h quittd th tabl.
Th littl princss during th whol discussion and th rst of
th dinnr sat silnt, glancing with a frightnd look now at hr
fathr-in-law and now at Princss Mary. Whn thy lft th tabl sh
took hr sistr-in-law’s arm and drw hr into anothr room.
“What a clvr man your fathr is,” said sh; “prhaps that is why
I am afraid of him.”
“Oh, h is so kind!” answrd Princss Mary.
CHAPTR XXVIII
Princ Andrw was to lav nxt vning. Th old princ, not altring
his routin, rtird as usual aftr dinnr. Th littl princss was in
hr sistr-in-law’s room. Princ Andrw in a travling coat without
paultts had bn packing with his valt in th rooms assignd to him.
Aftr inspcting th carriag himslf and sing th trunks put in, h
ordrd th horss to b harnssd. Only thos things h always kpt
with him rmaind in his room; a small box, a larg cantn fittd
with silvr plat, two Turkish pistols and a sabr—a prsnt from
his fathr who had brought it from th sig of Ochákov. All ths
travling ffcts of Princ Andrw’s wr in vry good ordr: nw,
clan, and in cloth covrs carfully tid with taps.
Whn starting on a journy or changing thir mod of lif, mn capabl
of rflction ar gnrally in a srious fram of mind. At such momnts
on rviws th past and plans for th futur. Princ Andrw’s fac
lookd vry thoughtful and tndr. With his hands bhind him h pacd
briskly from cornr to cornr of th room, looking straight bfor him
and thoughtfully shaking his had. Did h far going to th war, or was
h sad at laving his wif?—prhaps both, but vidntly h did not
wish to b sn in that mood, for haring footstps in th passag h
hurridly unclaspd his hands, stoppd at a tabl as if tying th
covr of th small box, and assumd his usual tranquil and impntrabl
xprssion. It was th havy trad of Princss Mary that h hard.
“I har you hav givn ordrs to harnss,” sh crid, panting (sh
had apparntly bn running), “and I did so wish to hav anothr talk
with you alon! God knows how long w may again b partd. You ar not
angry with m for coming? You hav changd so, Andrúsha,” sh addd,
as if to xplain such a qustion.
Sh smild as sh uttrd his pt nam, “Andrúsha.” It was
obviously strang to hr to think that this strn handsom man should b
Andrúsha—th slndr mischivous boy who had bn hr playfllow in
childhood.
“And whr is Lis?” h askd, answring hr qustion only by a
smil.
“Sh was so tird that sh has falln aslp on th sofa in my room.
Oh, Andrw! What a trasur of a wif you hav,” said sh, sitting
down on th sofa, facing hr brothr. “Sh is quit a child: such a
dar, mrry child. I hav grown so fond of hr.”
Princ Andrw was silnt, but th princss noticd th ironical and
contmptuous look that showd itslf on his fac.
“On must b indulgnt to littl waknsss; who is fr from thm,
Andrw? Don’t forgt that sh has grown up and bn ducatd in
socity, and so hr position now is not a rosy on. W should ntr into
vryon’s situation. Tout comprndr, c’st tout pardonnr. * Think
what it must b for hr, poor thing, aftr what sh has bn usd to,
to b partd from hr husband and b lft alon in th country, in hr
condition! It’s vry hard.”
     * To undrstand all is to forgiv all.
Princ Andrw smild as h lookd at his sistr, as w smil at thos w
think w thoroughly undrstand.
“You liv in th country and don’t think th lif trribl,” h
rplid.
“I... that’s diffrnt. Why spak of m? I don’t want any othr
lif, and can’t, for I know no othr. But think, Andrw: for a young
socity woman to b burid in th country during th bst yars of hr
lif, all alon—for Papa is always busy, and I... wll, you know what
poor rsourcs I hav for ntrtaining a woman usd to th bst socity.
Thr is only Madmoisll Bourinn....”
“I don’t lik your Madmoisll Bourinn at all,” said Princ
Andrw.
“No? Sh is vry nic and kind and, abov all, sh’s much to b
pitid. Sh has no on, no on. To tll th truth, I don’t nd hr,
and sh’s vn in my way. You know I always was a savag, and now am
vn mor so. I lik bing alon.... Fathr liks hr vry much. Sh and
Michal Ivánovich ar th two popl to whom h is always gntl and
kind, bcaus h has bn a bnfactor to thm both. As Strn says:
‘W don’t lov popl so much for th good thy hav don us, as
for th good w hav don thm.’ Fathr took hr whn sh was homlss
aftr losing hr own fathr. Sh is vry good-naturd, and my fathr
liks hr way of rading. Sh rads to him in th vnings and rads
splndidly.”
“To b quit frank, Mary, I xpct Fathr’s charactr somtims
maks things trying for you, dosn’t it?” Princ Andrw askd
suddnly.
Princss Mary was first surprisd and thn aghast at this qustion.
“For m? For m?... Trying for m!...” said sh.
“H always was rathr harsh; and now I should think h’s gtting
vry trying,” said Princ Andrw, apparntly spaking lightly of thir
fathr in ordr to puzzl or tst his sistr.
“You ar good in vry way, Andrw, but you hav a kind of
intllctual prid,” said th princss, following th train of hr own
thoughts rathr than th trnd of th convrsation—“and that’s a
grat sin. How can on judg Fathr? But vn if on might, what fling
xcpt vnration could such a man as my fathr vok? And I am so
contntd and happy with him. I only wish you wr all as happy as I
am.”
Hr brothr shook his had incrdulously.
“Th only thing that is hard for m... I will tll you th truth,
Andrw... is Fathr’s way of trating rligious subjcts. I don’t
undrstand how a man of his immns intllct can fail to s what is
as clar as day, and can go so far astray. That is th only thing
that maks m unhappy. But vn in this I can s latly a shad of
improvmnt. His satir has bn lss bittr of lat, and thr was a
monk h rcivd and had a long talk with.”
“Ah! my dar, I am afraid you and your monk ar wasting your
powdr,” said Princ Andrw bantringly yt tndrly.
“Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hop that God will har m.
Andrw...” sh said timidly aftr a momnt’s silnc, “I hav a
grat favor to ask of you.”
“What is it, dar?”
“No—promis that you will not rfus! It will giv you no troubl
and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort m. Promis,
Andrúsha!...” said sh, putting hr hand in hr rticul but not yt
taking out what sh was holding insid it, as if what sh hld wr
th subjct of hr rqust and must not b shown bfor th rqust was
grantd.
Sh lookd timidly at hr brothr.
“vn if it wr a grat dal of troubl...” answrd Princ Andrw,
as if gussing what it was about.
“Think what you plas! I know you ar just lik Fathr. Think as
you plas, but do this for my sak! Plas do! Fathr’s fathr, our
grandfathr, wor it in all his wars.” (Sh still did not tak out
what sh was holding in hr rticul.) “So you promis?”
“Of cours. What is it?”
“Andrw, I blss you with this icon and you must promis m you will
nvr tak it off. Do you promis?”
“If it dos not wigh a hundrdwight and won’t brak my nck...
To plas you...” said Princ Andrw. But immdiatly, noticing
th paind xprssion his jok had brought to his sistr’s fac, h
rpntd and addd: “I am glad; rally, dar, I am vry glad.”
“Against your will H will sav and hav mrcy on you and bring you
to Himslf, for in Him alon is truth and pac,” said sh in a voic
trmbling with motion, solmnly holding up in both hands bfor hr
brothr a small, oval, antiqu, dark-facd icon of th Saviour in a gold
stting, on a finly wrought silvr chain.
Sh crossd hrslf, kissd th icon, and handd it to Andrw.
“Plas, Andrw, for my sak!...”
Rays of gntl light shon from hr larg, timid ys. Thos ys lit
up th whol of hr thin, sickly fac and mad it bautiful. Hr brothr
would hav takn th icon, but sh stoppd him. Andrw undrstood,
crossd himslf and kissd th icon. Thr was a look of tndrnss, for
h was touchd, but also a glam of irony on his fac.
“Thank you, my dar.” Sh kissd him on th forhad and sat down
again on th sofa. Thy wr silnt for a whil.
“As I was saying to you, Andrw, b kind and gnrous as you always
usd to b. Don’t judg Lis harshly,” sh bgan. “Sh is so
swt, so good-naturd, and hr position now is a vry hard on.”
“I do not think I hav complaind of my wif to you, Másha, or blamd
hr. Why do you say all this to m?”
Rd patchs appard on Princss Mary’s fac and sh was silnt as if
sh flt guilty.
“I hav said nothing to you, but you hav alrady bn talkd to. And
I am sorry for that,” h wnt on.
Th patchs grw dpr on hr forhad, nck, and chks. Sh trid to
say somthing but could not. Hr brothr had gussd right: th littl
princss had bn crying aftr dinnr and had spokn of hr forbodings
about hr confinmnt, and how sh dradd it, and had complaind of hr
fat, hr fathr-in-law, and hr husband. Aftr crying sh had falln
aslp. Princ Andrw flt sorry for his sistr.
“Know this, Másha: I can’t rproach, hav not rproachd, and nvr
shall rproach my wif with anything, and I cannot rproach myslf
with anything in rgard to hr; and that always will b so in whatvr
circumstancs I may b placd. But if you want to know th truth... if
you want to know whthr I am happy? No! Is sh happy? No! But why this
is so I don’t know...”
As h said this h ros, wnt to his sistr, and, stooping, kissd
hr forhad. His fin ys lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and
unaccustomd brightnss, but h was looking not at his sistr but ovr
hr had toward th darknss of th opn doorway.
“Lt us go to hr, I must say good-by. Or—go and wak and I’ll
com in a momnt. Ptrúshka!” h calld to his valt: “Com hr,
tak ths away. Put this on th sat and this to th right.”
Princss Mary ros and movd to th door, thn stoppd and said:
“Andrw, if you had faith you would hav turnd to God and askd Him
to giv you th lov you do not fl, and your prayr would hav bn
answrd.”
“Wll, mayb!” said Princ Andrw. “Go, Másha; I’ll com
immdiatly.”
On th way to his sistr’s room, in th passag which connctd on
wing with th othr, Princ Andrw mt Madmoisll Bourinn smiling
swtly. It was th third tim that day that, with an cstatic and
artlss smil, sh had mt him in scludd passags.
“Oh! I thought you wr in your room,” sh said, for som rason
blushing and dropping hr ys.
Princ Andrw lookd strnly at hr and an xprssion of angr suddnly
cam ovr his fac. H said nothing to hr but lookd at hr forhad
and hair, without looking at hr ys, with such contmpt that th
Frnchwoman blushd and wnt away without a word. Whn h rachd his
sistr’s room his wif was alrady awak and hr mrry voic, hurrying
on word aftr anothr, cam through th opn door. Sh was spaking as
usual in Frnch, and as if aftr long slf-rstraint sh wishd to mak
up for lost tim.
“No, but imagin th old Countss Zúbova, with fals curls and hr
mouth full of fals tth, as if sh wr trying to chat old ag....
Ha, ha, ha! Mary!”
This vry sntnc about Countss Zúbova and this sam laugh Princ
Andrw had alrady hard from his wif in th prsnc of othrs som
fiv tims. H ntrd th room softly. Th littl princss, plump and
rosy, was sitting in an asy chair with hr work in hr hands, talking
incssantly, rpating Ptrsburg rminiscncs and vn phrass. Princ
Andrw cam up, strokd hr hair, and askd if sh flt rstd aftr
thir journy. Sh answrd him and continud hr chattr.
Th coach with six horss was waiting at th porch. It was an autumn
night, so dark that th coachman could not s th carriag pol.
Srvants with lantrns wr bustling about in th porch. Th immns
hous was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. Th
domstic srfs wr crowding in th hall, waiting to bid good-by to
th young princ. Th mmbrs of th houshold wr all gathrd in th
rcption hall: Michal Ivánovich, Madmoisll Bourinn, Princss
Mary, and th littl princss. Princ Andrw had bn calld to his
fathr’s study as th lattr wishd to say good-by to him alon. All
wr waiting for thm to com out.
Whn Princ Andrw ntrd th study th old man in his old-ag
spctacls and whit drssing gown, in which h rcivd no on but his
son, sat at th tabl writing. H glancd round.
“Going?” And h wnt on writing.
“I’v com to say good-by.”
“Kiss m hr,” and h touchd his chk: “Thanks, thanks!”
“What do you thank m for?”
“For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman’s apron strings.
Th Srvic bfor vrything. Thanks, thanks!” And h wnt on
writing, so that his quill spluttrd and squakd. “If you hav
anything to say, say it. Ths two things can b don togthr,” h
addd.
“About my wif... I am ashamd as it is to lav hr on your
hands....”
“Why talk nonsns? Say what you want.”
“Whn hr confinmnt is du, snd to Moscow for an accouchur.... Lt
him b hr....”
Th old princ stoppd writing and, as if not undrstanding, fixd his
strn ys on his son.
“I know that no on can hlp if natur dos not do hr work,” said
Princ Andrw, vidntly confusd. “I know that out of a million
cass only on gos wrong, but it is hr fancy and min. Thy hav bn
tlling hr things. Sh has had a dram and is frightnd.”
“Hm... Hm...” muttrd th old princ to himslf, finishing what h
was writing. “I’ll do it.”
H signd with a flourish and suddnly turning to his son bgan to
laugh.
“It’s a bad businss, h?”
“What is bad, Fathr?”
“Th wif!” said th old princ, brifly and significantly.
“I don’t undrstand!” said Princ Andrw.
“No, it can’t b hlpd, lad,” said th princ. “Thy’r
all lik that; on can’t unmarry. Don’t b afraid; I won’t tll
anyon, but you know it yourslf.”
H sizd his son by th hand with small bony fingrs, shook it, lookd
straight into his son’s fac with kn ys which smd to s
through him, and again laughd his frigid laugh.
Th son sighd, thus admitting that his fathr had undrstood him. Th
old man continud to fold and sal his lttr, snatching up and throwing
down th wax, th sal, and th papr, with his accustomd rapidity.
“What’s to b don? Sh’s prtty! I will do vrything. Mak your
mind asy,” said h in abrupt sntncs whil saling his lttr.
Andrw did not spak; h was both plasd and displasd that his fathr
undrstood him. Th old man got up and gav th lttr to his son.
“Listn!” said h; “don’t worry about your wif: what can b
don shall b. Now listn! Giv this lttr to Michal Ilariónovich. *
I hav writtn that h should mak us of you in propr placs and not
kp you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tll him I rmmbr
and lik him. Writ and tll m how h rcivs you. If h is all
right—srv him. Nicholas Bolkónski’s son nd not srv undr
anyon if h is in disfavor. Now com hr.”
     *Kutúzov.
H spok so rapidly that h did not finish half his words, but his son
was accustomd to undrstand him. H ld him to th dsk, raisd th
lid, drw out a drawr, and took out an xrcis book filld with his
bold, tall, clos handwriting.
“I shall probably di bfor you. So rmmbr, ths ar my mmoirs;
hand thm to th mpror aftr my dath. Now hr is a Lombard bond
and a lttr; it is a prmium for th man who writs a history of
Suvórov’s wars. Snd it to th Acadmy. Hr ar som jottings for
you to rad whn I am gon. You will find thm usful.”
Andrw did not tll his fathr that h would no doubt liv a long tim
yt. H flt that h must not say it.
“I will do it all, Fathr,” h said.
“Wll, now, good-by!” H gav his son his hand to kiss, and mbracd
him. “Rmmbr this, Princ Andrw, if thy kill you it will hurt m,
your old fathr...” h pausd unxpctdly, and thn in a qurulous
voic suddnly shrikd: “but if I har that you hav not bhavd lik
a son of Nicholas Bolkónski, I shall b ashamd!”
“You nd not hav said that to m, Fathr,” said th son with a
smil.
Th old man was silnt.
“I also wantd to ask you,” continud Princ Andrw, “if I’m
killd and if I hav a son, do not lt him b takn away from you—as I
said ystrday... lt him grow up with you.... Plas.”
“Not lt th wif hav him?” said th old man, and laughd.
Thy stood silnt, facing on anothr. Th old man’s sharp ys wr
fixd straight on his son’s. Somthing twitchd in th lowr part of
th old princ’s fac.
“W’v said good-by. Go!” h suddnly shoutd in a loud, angry
voic, opning his door.
“What is it? What?” askd both princsss whn thy saw for a momnt
at th door Princ Andrw and th figur of th old man in a whit
drssing gown, spctacld and wiglss, shouting in an angry voic.
Princ Andrw sighd and mad no rply.
“Wll!” h said, turning to his wif.
And this “Wll!” soundd coldly ironic, as if h wr saying: “Now
go through your prformanc.”
“Andrw, alrady!” said th littl princss, turning pal and
looking with dismay at hr husband.
H mbracd hr. Sh scramd and fll unconscious on his shouldr.
H cautiously rlasd th shouldr sh land on, lookd into hr fac,
and carfully placd hr in an asy chair.
“Adiu, Mary,” said h gntly to his sistr, taking hr by th hand
and kissing hr, and thn h lft th room with rapid stps.
Th littl princss lay in th armchair, Madmoisll Bourinn chafing
hr tmpls. Princss Mary, supporting hr sistr-in-law, still lookd
with hr bautiful ys full of tars at th door through which Princ
Andrw had gon and mad th sign of th cross in his dirction. From
th study, lik pistol shots, cam th frqunt sound of th old man
angrily blowing his nos. Hardly had Princ Andrw gon whn th study
door opnd quickly and th strn figur of th old man in th whit
drssing gown lookd out.
“Gon? That’s all right!” said h; and looking angrily at th
unconscious littl princss, h shook his had rprovingly and slammd
th door.
BOOK TWO: 1805
CHAPTR I
In Octobr, 1805, a Russian army was occupying th villags and towns of
th Archduchy of Austria, and yt othr rgimnts frshly arriving from
Russia wr sttling nar th fortrss of Braunau and burdning th
inhabitants on whom thy wr quartrd. Braunau was th hadquartrs of
th commandr in chif, Kutúzov.
On Octobr 11, 1805, on of th infantry rgimnts that had just rachd
Braunau had haltd half a mil from th town, waiting to b inspctd
by th commandr in chif. Dspit th un-Russian apparanc of th
locality and surroundings—fruit gardns, ston fncs, tild roofs,
and hills in th distanc—and dspit th fact that th inhabitants
(who gazd with curiosity at th soldirs) wr not Russians, th
rgimnt had just th apparanc of any Russian rgimnt prparing for
an inspction anywhr in th hart of Russia.
On th vning of th last day’s march an ordr had bn rcivd that
th commandr in chif would inspct th rgimnt on th march. Though
th words of th ordr wr not clar to th rgimntal commandr, and
th qustion aros whthr th troops wr to b in marching ordr or
not, it was dcidd at a consultation btwn th battalion commandrs
to prsnt th rgimnt in parad ordr, on th principl that it is
always bttr to “bow too low than not bow low nough.” So th
soldirs, aftr a twnty-mil march, wr kpt mnding and claning all
night long without closing thir ys, whil th adjutants and
company commandrs calculatd and rckond, and by morning th
rgimnt—instad of th straggling, disordrly crowd it had bn on
its last march th day bfor—prsntd a wll-ordrd array of two
thousand mn ach of whom knw his plac and his duty, had vry button
and vry strap in plac, and shon with clanlinss. And not only
xtrnally was all in ordr, but had it plasd th commandr in chif
to look undr th uniforms h would hav found on vry man a clan
shirt, and in vry knapsack th appointd numbr of articls, “awl,
soap, and all,” as th soldirs say. Thr was only on circumstanc
concrning which no on could b at as. It was th stat of th
soldirs’ boots. Mor than half th mn’s boots wr in hols. But
this dfct was not du to any fault of th rgimntal commandr, for
in spit of rpatd dmands boots had not bn issud by th Austrian
commissariat, and th rgimnt had marchd som svn hundrd mils.
Th commandr of th rgimnt was an ldrly, cholric, stout, and
thick-st gnral with grizzld ybrows and whiskrs, and widr from
chst to back than across th shouldrs. H had on a brand-nw uniform
showing th crass whr it had bn foldd and thick gold paultts
which smd to stand rathr than li down on his massiv shouldrs. H
had th air of a man happily prforming on of th most solmn dutis of
his lif. H walkd about in front of th lin and at vry stp pulld
himslf up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that th commandr
admird his rgimnt, rjoicd in it, and that his whol mind was
ngrossd by it, yt his strut smd to indicat that, bsids military
mattrs, social intrsts and th fair sx occupid no small part of his
thoughts.
“Wll, Michal Mítrich, sir?” h said, addrssing on of th
battalion commandrs who smilingly prssd forward (it was plain that
thy both flt happy). “W had our hands full last night. Howvr, I
think th rgimnt is not a bad on, h?”
Th battalion commandr prcivd th jovial irony and laughd.
“It would not b turnd off th fild vn on th Tsarítsin
Madow.”
“What?” askd th commandr.
At that momnt, on th road from th town on which signalrs had bn
postd, two mn appard on hors back. Thy wr an aid-d-camp
followd by a Cossack.
Th aid-d-camp was snt to confirm th ordr which had not bn
clarly wordd th day bfor, namly, that th commandr in chif
wishd to s th rgimnt just in th stat in which it had bn on
th march: in thir gratcoats, and packs, and without any prparation
whatvr.
A mmbr of th Hofkrigsrath from Vinna had com to Kutúzov th day
bfor with proposals and dmands for him to join up with th army of
th Archduk Frdinand and Mack, and Kutúzov, not considring this
junction advisabl, mant, among othr argumnts in support of his viw,
to show th Austrian gnral th wrtchd stat in which th troops
arrivd from Russia. With this objct h intndd to mt th rgimnt;
so th wors th condition it was in, th bttr plasd th commandr
in chif would b. Though th aid-d-camp did not know ths
circumstancs, h nvrthlss dlivrd th dfinit ordr that th
mn should b in thir gratcoats and in marching ordr, and that th
commandr in chif would othrwis b dissatisfid. On haring this th
rgimntal commandr hung his had, silntly shruggd his shouldrs, and
sprad out his arms with a cholric gstur.
“A fin mss w’v mad of it!” h rmarkd.
“Thr now! Didn’t I tll you, Michal Mítrich, that if it was said
‘on th march’ it mant in gratcoats?” said h rproachfully to
th battalion commandr. “Oh, my God!” h addd, stpping rsolutly
forward. “Company commandrs!” h shoutd in a voic accustomd to
command. “Srgants major!... How soon will h b hr?” h askd
th aid-d-camp with a rspctful politnss vidntly rlating to th
prsonag h was rfrring to.
“In an hour’s tim, I should say.”
“Shall w hav tim to chang cloths?”
“I don’t know, Gnral....”
Th rgimntal commandr, going up to th lin himslf, ordrd th
soldirs to chang into thir gratcoats. Th company commandrs ran off
to thir companis, th srgants major bgan bustling (th gratcoats
wr not in vry good condition), and instantly th squars that had up
to thn bn in rgular ordr and silnt bgan to sway and strtch and
hum with voics. On all sids soldirs wr running to and fro, throwing
up thir knapsacks with a jrk of thir shouldrs and pulling th straps
ovr thir hads, unstrapping thir ovrcoats and drawing th slvs on
with upraisd arms.
In half an hour all was again in ordr, only th squars had bcom gray
instad of black. Th rgimntal commandr walkd with his jrky stps
to th front of th rgimnt and xamind it from a distanc.
“Whatvr is this? This!” h shoutd and stood still. “Commandr
of th third company!”
“Commandr of th third company wantd by th gnral!... commandr to
th gnral... third company to th commandr.” Th words passd along
th lins and an adjutant ran to look for th missing officr.
Whn th agr but misrpatd words had rachd thir dstination in
a cry of: “Th gnral to th third company,” th missing officr
appard from bhind his company and, though h was a middl-agd man
and not in th habit of running, trottd awkwardly stumbling on his
tos toward th gnral. Th captain’s fac showd th unasinss of
a schoolboy who is told to rpat a lsson h has not larnd. Spots
appard on his nos, th rdnss of which was vidntly du to
intmpranc, and his mouth twitchd nrvously. Th gnral lookd th
captain up and down as h cam up panting, slackning his pac as h
approachd.
“You will soon b drssing your mn in ptticoats! What is this?”
shoutd th rgimntal commandr, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldir in th ranks of th third company in a gratcoat of bluish
cloth, which contrastd with th othrs. “What hav you bn aftr?
Th commandr in chif is xpctd and you lav your plac? h? I’ll
tach you to drss th mn in fancy coats for a parad.... h...?”
Th commandr of th company, with his ys fixd on his suprior,
prssd two fingrs mor and mor rigidly to his cap, as if in this
prssur lay his only hop of salvation.
“Wll, why don’t you spak? Whom hav you got thr drssd up as a
Hungarian?” said th commandr with an austr gib.
“Your xcllncy...”
“Wll, your xcllncy, what? Your xcllncy! But what about your
xcllncy?... nobody knows.”
“Your xcllncy, it’s th officr Dólokhov, who has bn rducd
to th ranks,” said th captain softly.
“Wll? Has h bn dgradd into a fild marshal, or into a soldir?
If a soldir, h should b drssd in rgulation uniform lik th
othrs.”
“Your xcllncy, you gav him lav yourslf, on th march.”
“Gav him lav? Lav? That’s just lik you young mn,” said th
rgimntal commandr cooling down a littl. “Lav indd.... On says
a word to you and you... What?” h addd with rnwd irritation, “I
bg you to drss your mn dcntly.”
And th commandr, turning to look at th adjutant, dirctd his jrky
stps down th lin. H was vidntly plasd at his own display of
angr and walking up to th rgimnt wishd to find a furthr xcus for
wrath. Having snappd at an officr for an unpolishd badg, at anothr
bcaus his lin was not straight, h rachd th third company.
“H-o-o-w ar you standing? Whr’s your lg? Your lg?” shoutd
th commandr with a ton of suffring in his voic, whil thr wr
still fiv mn btwn him and Dólokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.
Dólokhov slowly straightnd his bnt kn, looking straight with his
clar, insolnt ys in th gnral’s fac.
“Why a blu coat? Off with it... Srgant major! Chang his coat...
th ras...” h did not finish.
“Gnral, I must oby ordrs, but I am not bound to ndur...”
Dólokhov hurridly intrruptd.
“No talking in th ranks!... No talking, no talking!”
“Not bound to ndur insults,” Dólokhov concludd in loud, ringing
tons.
Th ys of th gnral and th soldir mt. Th gnral bcam silnt,
angrily pulling down his tight scarf.
“I rqust you to hav th goodnss to chang your coat,” h said as
h turnd away.
CHAPTR II
“H’s coming!” shoutd th signalr at that momnt.
Th rgimntal commandr, flushing, ran to his hors, sizd th stirrup
with trmbling hands, thrw his body across th saddl, rightd himslf,
drw his sabr, and with a happy and rsolut countnanc, opning
his mouth awry, prpard to shout. Th rgimnt fluttrd lik a bird
prning its plumag and bcam motionlss.
“Att-ntion!” shoutd th rgimntal commandr in a soul-shaking
voic which xprssd joy for himslf, svrity for th rgimnt, and
wlcom for th approaching chif.
Along th broad country road, dgd on both sids by trs, cam a high,
light blu Vinns calèch, slightly craking on its springs and drawn
by six horss at a smart trot. Bhind th calèch gallopd th suit
and a convoy of Croats. Bsid Kutúzov sat an Austrian gnral, in
a whit uniform that lookd strang among th Russian black ons. Th
calèch stoppd in front of th rgimnt. Kutúzov and th Austrian
gnral wr talking in low voics and Kutúzov smild slightly as
trading havily h stppd down from th carriag just as if thos two
thousand mn brathlssly gazing at him and th rgimntal commandr did
not xist.
Th word of command rang out, and again th rgimnt quivrd, as with a
jingling sound it prsntd arms. Thn amidst a dad silnc th
fbl voic of th commandr in chif was hard. Th rgimnt roard,
“Halth to your x... ln... ln... lncy!” and again all bcam
silnt. At first Kutúzov stood still whil th rgimnt movd; thn h
and th gnral in whit, accompanid by th suit, walkd btwn th
ranks.
From th way th rgimntal commandr salutd th commandr in chif and
dvourd him with his ys, drawing himslf up obsquiously, and from
th way h walkd through th ranks bhind th gnrals, bnding forward
and hardly abl to rstrain his jrky movmnts, and from th way h
dartd forward at vry word or gstur of th commandr in chif,
it was vidnt that h prformd his duty as a subordinat with vn
gratr zal than his duty as a commandr. Thanks to th strictnss and
assiduity of its commandr th rgimnt, in comparison with othrs that
had rachd Braunau at th sam tim, was in splndid condition. Thr
wr only 217 sick and stragglrs. vrything was in good ordr xcpt
th boots.
Kutúzov walkd through th ranks, somtims stopping to say a fw
frindly words to officrs h had known in th Turkish war, somtims
also to th soldirs. Looking at thir boots h svral tims shook his
had sadly, pointing thm out to th Austrian gnral with an xprssion
which smd to say that h was not blaming anyon, but could not hlp
noticing what a bad stat of things it was. Th rgimntal commandr
ran forward on ach such occasion, faring to miss a singl word of th
commandr in chif’s rgarding th rgimnt. Bhind Kutúzov, at a
distanc that allowd vry softly spokn word to b hard, followd
som twnty mn of his suit. Ths gntlmn talkd among thmslvs
and somtims laughd. Narst of all to th commandr in chif walkd
a handsom adjutant. This was Princ Bolkónski. Bsid him was his
comrad Nsvítski, a tall staff officr, xtrmly stout, with a
kindly, smiling, handsom fac and moist ys. Nsvítski could hardly
kp from laughtr provokd by a swarthy hussar officr who walkd
bsid him. This hussar, with a grav fac and without a smil or a
chang in th xprssion of his fixd ys, watchd th rgimntal
commandr’s back and mimickd his vry movmnt. ach tim th
commandr startd and bnt forward, th hussar startd and bnt forward
in xactly th sam mannr. Nsvítski laughd and nudgd th othrs to
mak thm look at th wag.
Kutúzov walkd slowly and languidly past thousands of ys which wr
starting from thir sockts to watch thir chif. On raching th
third company h suddnly stoppd. His suit, not having xpctd this,
involuntarily cam closr to him.
“Ah, Timókhin!” said h, rcognizing th rd-nosd captain who had
bn rprimandd on account of th blu gratcoat.
On would hav thought it impossibl for a man to strtch himslf
mor than Timókhin had don whn h was rprimandd by th rgimntal
commandr, but now that th commandr in chif addrssd him h drw
himslf up to such an xtnt that it smd h could not hav sustaind
it had th commandr in chif continud to look at him, and so Kutúzov,
who vidntly undrstood his cas and wishd him nothing but good,
quickly turnd away, a scarcly prcptibl smil flitting ovr his
scarrd and puffy fac.
“Anothr Ismail comrad,” said h. “A brav officr! Ar you
satisfid with him?” h askd th rgimntal commandr.
And th lattr—unconscious that h was bing rflctd in th hussar
officr as in a looking glass—startd, movd forward, and answrd:
“Highly satisfid, your xcllncy!”
“W all hav our waknsss,” said Kutúzov smiling and walking away
from him. “H usd to hav a prdilction for Bacchus.”
Th rgimntal commandr was afraid h might b blamd for this and did
not answr. Th hussar at that momnt noticd th fac of th rd-nosd
captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimickd his xprssion and pos
with such xactitud that Nsvítski could not hlp laughing. Kutúzov
turnd round. Th officr vidntly had complt control of his fac,
and whil Kutúzov was turning managd to mak a grimac and thn assum
a most srious, dfrntial, and innocnt xprssion.
Th third company was th last, and Kutúzov pondrd, apparntly trying
to rcollct somthing. Princ Andrw stppd forward from among th
suit and said in Frnch:
“You told m to rmind you of th officr Dólokhov, rducd to th
ranks in this rgimnt.”
“Whr is Dólokhov?” askd Kutúzov.
Dólokhov, who had alrady changd into a soldir’s gray gratcoat,
did not wait to b calld. Th shaply figur of th fair-haird
soldir, with his clar blu ys, stppd forward from th ranks, wnt
up to th commandr in chif, and prsntd arms.
“Hav you a complaint to mak?” Kutúzov askd with a slight frown.
“This is Dólokhov,” said Princ Andrw.
“Ah!” said Kutúzov. “I hop this will b a lsson to you. Do your
duty. Th mpror is gracious, and I shan’t forgt you if you dsrv
wll.”
Th clar blu ys lookd at th commandr in chif just as boldly as
thy had lookd at th rgimntal commandr, sming by thir xprssion
to tar opn th vil of convntion that sparats a commandr in chif
so widly from a privat.
“On thing I ask of your xcllncy,” Dólokhov said in his firm,
ringing, dlibrat voic. “I ask an opportunity to aton for my fault
and prov my dvotion to His Majsty th mpror and to Russia!”
Kutúzov turnd away. Th sam smil of th ys with which h had
turnd from Captain Timókhin again flittd ovr his fac. H turnd
away with a grimac as if to say that vrything Dólokhov had said to
him and vrything h could say had long bn known to him, that h was
wary of it and it was not at all what h wantd. H turnd away and
wnt to th carriag.
Th rgimnt brok up into companis, which wnt to thir appointd
quartrs nar Braunau, whr thy hopd to rciv boots and cloths and
to rst aftr thir hard marchs.
“You won’t bar m a grudg, Prokhór Ignátych?” said th
rgimntal commandr, ovrtaking th third company on its way to its
quartrs and riding up to Captain Timókhin who was walking in front.
(Th rgimntal commandr’s fac now that th inspction was happily
ovr bamd with irrprssibl dlight.) “It’s in th mpror’s
srvic... it can’t b hlpd... on is somtims a bit hasty on
parad... I am th first to apologiz, you know m!... H was vry
plasd!” And h hld out his hand to th captain.
“Don’t mntion it, Gnral, as if I’d b so bold!” rplid th
captain, his nos growing rddr as h gav a smil which showd whr
two front tth wr missing that had bn knockd out by th butt nd
of a gun at Ismail.
“And tll Mr. Dólokhov that I won’t forgt him—h may b quit
asy. And tll m, plas—I’v bn maning to ask—how is h
bhaving himslf, and in gnral...”
“As far as th srvic gos h is quit punctilious, your xcllncy;
but his charactr...” said Timókhin.
“And what about his charactr?” askd th rgimntal commandr.
“It’s diffrnt on diffrnt days,” answrd th captain. “On
day h is snsibl, wll ducatd, and good-naturd, and th nxt h’s
a wild bast.... In Poland, if you plas, h narly killd a Jw.”
“Oh, wll, wll!” rmarkd th rgimntal commandr. “Still, on
must hav pity on a young man in misfortun. You know h has important
connctions... Wll, thn, you just...”
“I will, your xcllncy,” said Timókhin, showing by his smil that
h undrstood his commandr’s wish.
“Wll, of cours, of cours!”
Th rgimntal commandr sought out Dólokhov in th ranks and, rining
in his hors, said to him:
“Aftr th nxt affair... paultts.”
Dólokhov lookd round but did not say anything, nor did th mocking
smil on his lips chang.
“Wll, that’s all right,” continud th rgimntal commandr. “A
cup of vodka for th mn from m,” h addd so that th soldirs
could har. “I thank you all! God b praisd!” and h rod past that
company and ovrtook th nxt on.
“Wll, h’s rally a good fllow, on can srv undr him,” said
Timókhin to th subaltrn bsid him.
“In a word, a harty on...” said th subaltrn, laughing (th
rgimntal commandr was nicknamd King of Harts).
Th chrful mood of thir officrs aftr th inspction infctd th
soldirs. Th company marchd on gaily. Th soldirs’ voics could b
hard on vry sid.
“And thy said Kutúzov was blind of on y?”
“And so h is! Quit blind!”
“No, frind, h is sharpr-yd than you ar. Boots and lg bands...
h noticd vrything...”
“Whn h lookd at my ft, frind... wll, thinks I...”
“And that othr on with him, th Austrian, lookd as if h wr
smard with chalk—as whit as flour! I suppos thy polish him up as
thy do th guns.”
“I say, Fdshon!... Did h say whn th battls ar to bgin? You
wr nar him. vrybody said that Buonapart himslf was at Braunau.”
“Buonapart himslf!... Just listn to th fool, what h dosn’t
know! Th Prussians ar up in arms now. Th Austrians, you s, ar
putting thm down. Whn thy’v bn put down, th war with Buonapart
will bgin. And h says Buonapart is in Braunau! Shows you’r a fool.
You’d bttr listn mor carfully!”
“What dvils ths quartrmastrs ar! S, th fifth company is
turning into th villag alrady... thy will hav thir buckwhat
cookd bfor w rach our quartrs.”
“Giv m a biscuit, you dvil!”
“And did you giv m tobacco ystrday? That’s just it, frind! Ah,
wll, nvr mind, hr you ar.”
“Thy might call a halt hr or w’ll hav to do anothr four mils
without ating.”
“Wasn’t it fin whn thos Grmans gav us lifts! You just sit still
and ar drawn along.”
“And hr, frind, th popl ar quit bggarly. Thr thy all
smd to b Pols—all undr th Russian crown—but hr thy’r
all rgular Grmans.”
“Singrs to th front” cam th captain’s ordr.
And from th diffrnt ranks som twnty mn ran to th front. A
drummr, thir ladr, turnd round facing th singrs, and flourishing
his arm, bgan a long-drawn-out soldirs’ song, commncing with th
words: “Morning dawnd, th sun was rising,” and concluding: “On
thn, brothrs, on to glory, ld by Fathr Kámnski.” This song had
bn composd in th Turkish campaign and now bing sung in Austria, th
only chang bing that th words “Fathr Kámnski” wr rplacd by
“Fathr Kutúzov.”
Having jrkd out ths last words as soldirs do and wavd his arms
as if flinging somthing to th ground, th drummr—a lan, handsom
soldir of forty—lookd strnly at th singrs and scrwd up his
ys. Thn having satisfid himslf that all ys wr fixd on him,
h raisd both arms as if carfully lifting som invisibl but prcious
objct abov his had and, holding it thr for som sconds, suddnly
flung it down and bgan:
“Oh, my bowr, oh, my bowr...!”
“Oh, my bowr nw...!” chimd in twnty voics, and th castant
playr, in spit of th burdn of his quipmnt, rushd out to th front
and, walking backwards bfor th company, jrkd his shouldrs and
flourishd his castants as if thratning somon. Th soldirs,
swinging thir arms and kping tim spontanously, marchd with long
stps. Bhind th company th sound of whls, th craking of springs,
and th tramp of horss’ hoofs wr hard. Kutúzov and his suit wr
rturning to th town. Th commandr in chif mad a sign that th
mn should continu to march at as, and h and all his suit showd
plasur at th sound of th singing and th sight of th dancing
soldir and th gay and smartly marching mn. In th scond fil
from th right flank, bsid which th carriag passd th company,
a blu-yd soldir involuntarily attractd notic. It was Dólokhov
marching with particular grac and boldnss in tim to th song and
looking at thos driving past as if h pitid all who wr not at that
momnt marching with th company. Th hussar cornt of Kutúzov’s
suit who had mimickd th rgimntal commandr, fll back from th
carriag and rod up to Dólokhov.
Hussar cornt Zhrkóv had at on tim, in Ptrsburg, blongd to
th wild st ld by Dólokhov. Zhrkóv had mt Dólokhov abroad as a
privat and had not sn fit to rcogniz him. But now that Kutúzov had
spokn to th gntlman rankr, h addrssd him with th cordiality of
an old frind.
“My dar fllow, how ar you?” said h through th singing, making
his hors kp pac with th company.
“How am I?” Dólokhov answrd coldly. “I am as you s.”
Th livly song gav a spcial flavor to th ton of fr and asy
gaity with which Zhrkóv spok, and to th intntional coldnss of
Dólokhov’s rply.
“And how do you gt on with th officrs?” inquird Zhrkóv.
“All right. Thy ar good fllows. And how hav you wriggld onto th
staff?”
“I was attachd; I’m on duty.”
Both wr silnt.
“Sh lt th hawk fly upward from hr wid right slv,” wnt th
song, arousing an involuntary snsation of courag and chrfulnss.
Thir convrsation would probably hav bn diffrnt but for th ffct
of that song.
“Is it tru that Austrians hav bn batn?” askd Dólokhov.
“Th dvil only knows! Thy say so.”
“I’m glad,” answrd Dólokhov brifly and clarly, as th song
dmandd.
“I say, com round som vning and w’ll hav a gam of faro!”
said Zhrkóv.
“Why, hav you too much mony?”
“Do com.”
“I can’t. I’v sworn not to. I won’t drink and won’t play till
I gt rinstatd.”
“Wll, that’s only till th first ngagmnt.”
“W shall s.”
Thy wr again silnt.
“Com if you nd anything. On can at last b of us on th
staff...”
Dólokhov smild. “Don’t troubl. If I want anything, I won’t
bg—I’ll tak it!”
“Wll, nvr mind; I only...”
“And I only...”
“Good-by.”
“Good halth...”
        “It’s a long, long way.
        To my nativ land...”
Zhrkóv touchd his hors with th spurs; it prancd xcitdly from
foot to foot uncrtain with which to start, thn sttld down, gallopd
past th company, and ovrtook th carriag, still kping tim to th
song.
CHAPTR III
On rturning from th rviw, Kutúzov took th Austrian gnral into
his privat room and, calling his adjutant, askd for som paprs
rlating to th condition of th troops on thir arrival, and th
lttrs that had com from th Archduk Frdinand, who was in command of
th advancd army. Princ Andrw Bolkónski cam into th room with th
rquird paprs. Kutúzov and th Austrian mmbr of th Hofkrigsrath
wr sitting at th tabl on which a plan was sprad out.
“Ah!...” said Kutúzov glancing at Bolkónski as if by this
xclamation h was asking th adjutant to wait, and h wnt on with th
convrsation in Frnch.
“All I can say, Gnral,” said h with a plasant lganc
of xprssion and intonation that obligd on to listn to ach
dlibratly spokn word. It was vidnt that Kutúzov himslf listnd
with plasur to his own voic. “All I can say, Gnral, is that if
th mattr dpndd on my prsonal wishs, th will of His Majsty th
mpror Francis would hav bn fulfilld long ago. I should long
ago hav joind th archduk. And bliv m on my honour that to m
prsonally it would b a plasur to hand ovr th suprm command
of th army into th hands of a bttr informd and mor skillful
gnral—of whom Austria has so many—and to lay down all this havy
rsponsibility. But circumstancs ar somtims too strong for us,
Gnral.”
And Kutúzov smild in a way that smd to say, “You ar quit at
librty not to bliv m and I don’t vn car whthr you do or
not, but you hav no grounds for tlling m so. And that is th whol
point.”
Th Austrian gnral lookd dissatisfid, but had no option but to rply
in th sam ton.
“On th contrary,” h said, in a qurulous and angry ton that
contrastd with his flattring words, “on th contrary, your
xcllncy’s participation in th common action is highly valud by
His Majsty; but w think th prsnt dlay is dpriving th splndid
Russian troops and thir commandr of th laurls thy hav bn
accustomd to win in thir battls,” h concludd his vidntly
prarrangd sntnc.
Kutúzov bowd with th sam smil.
“But that is my conviction, and judging by th last lttr with which
His Highnss th Archduk Frdinand has honord m, I imagin that th
Austrian troops, undr th dirction of so skillful a ladr as Gnral
Mack, hav by now alrady gaind a dcisiv victory and no longr nd
our aid,” said Kutúzov.
Th gnral frownd. Though thr was no dfinit nws of an Austrian
dfat, thr wr many circumstancs confirming th unfavorabl rumors
that wr afloat, and so Kutúzov’s suggstion of an Austrian victory
soundd much lik irony. But Kutúzov wnt on blandly smiling with th
sam xprssion, which smd to say that h had a right to suppos
so. And, in fact, th last lttr h had rcivd from Mack’s army
informd him of a victory and statd stratgically th position of th
army was vry favorabl.
“Giv m that lttr,” said Kutúzov turning to Princ Andrw.
“Plas hav a look at it”—and Kutúzov with an ironical smil
about th cornrs of his mouth rad to th Austrian gnral th
following passag, in Grman, from th Archduk Frdinand’s lttr:
W hav fully concntratd forcs of narly svnty thousand mn with
which to attack and dfat th nmy should h cross th Lch. Also,
as w ar mastrs of Ulm, w cannot b dprivd of th advantag of
commanding both sids of th Danub, so that should th nmy not
cross th Lch, w can cross th Danub, throw ourslvs on his lin
of communications, rcross th rivr lowr down, and frustrat his
intntion should h try to dirct his whol forc against our faithful
ally. W shall thrfor confidntly await th momnt whn th Imprial
Russian army will b fully quippd, and shall thn, in conjunction with
it, asily find a way to prpar for th nmy th fat h dsrvs.
Kutúzov sighd dply on finishing this paragraph and lookd at th
mmbr of th Hofkrigsrath mildly and attntivly.
“But you know th wis maxim your xcllncy, advising on to xpct
th worst,” said th Austrian gnral, vidntly wishing to hav don
with jsts and to com to businss. H involuntarily lookd round at th
aid-d-camp.
“xcus m, Gnral,” intrruptd Kutúzov, also turning to Princ
Andrw. “Look hr, my dar fllow, gt from Kozlóvski all th
rports from our scouts. Hr ar two lttrs from Count Nostitz and
hr is on from His Highnss th Archduk Frdinand and hr ar
ths,” h said, handing him svral paprs, “mak a nat mmorandum
in Frnch out of all this, showing all th nws w hav had of th
movmnts of th Austrian army, and thn giv it to his xcllncy.”
Princ Andrw bowd his had in tokn of having undrstood from th
first not only what had bn said but also what Kutúzov would hav
likd to tll him. H gathrd up th paprs and with a bow to both,
stppd softly ovr th carpt and wnt out into th waiting room.
Though not much tim had passd sinc Princ Andrw had lft Russia, h
had changd gratly during that priod. In th xprssion of his fac,
in his movmnts, in his walk, scarcly a trac was lft of his formr
affctd languor and indolnc. H now lookd lik a man who has tim
to think of th imprssion h maks on othrs, but is occupid with
agrabl and intrsting work. His fac xprssd mor satisfaction
with himslf and thos around him, his smil and glanc wr brightr
and mor attractiv.
Kutúzov, whom h had ovrtakn in Poland, had rcivd him vry kindly,
promisd not to forgt him, distinguishd him abov th othr adjutants,
and had takn him to Vinna and givn him th mor srious commissions.
From Vinna Kutúzov wrot to his old comrad, Princ Andrw’s fathr.
Your son bids fair to bcom an officr distinguishd by his industry,
firmnss, and xpdition. I considr myslf fortunat to hav such a
subordinat by m.
On Kutúzov’s staff, among his fllow officrs and in th army
gnrally, Princ Andrw had, as h had had in Ptrsburg socity, two
quit opposit rputations. Som, a minority, acknowldgd him to b
diffrnt from thmslvs and from vryon ls, xpctd grat things
of him, listnd to him, admird, and imitatd him, and with thm Princ
Andrw was natural and plasant. Othrs, th majority, dislikd him and
considrd him concitd, cold, and disagrabl. But among ths popl
Princ Andrw knw how to tak his stand so that thy rspctd and vn
fard him.
Coming out of Kutúzov’s room into th waiting room with th paprs in
his hand Princ Andrw cam up to his comrad, th aid-d-camp on duty,
Kozlóvski, who was sitting at th window with a book.
“Wll, Princ?” askd Kozlóvski.
“I am ordrd to writ a mmorandum xplaining why w ar not
advancing.”
“And why is it?”
Princ Andrw shruggd his shouldrs.
“Any nws from Mack?”
“No.”
“If it wr tru that h has bn batn, nws would hav com.”
“Probably,” said Princ Andrw moving toward th outr door.
But at that instant a tall Austrian gnral in a gratcoat, with th
ordr of Maria Thrsa on his nck and a black bandag round his had,
who had vidntly just arrivd, ntrd quickly, slamming th door.
Princ Andrw stoppd short.
“Commandr in Chif Kutúzov?” said th nwly arrivd gnral
spaking quickly with a harsh Grman accnt, looking to both sids and
advancing straight toward th innr door.
“Th commandr in chif is ngagd,” said Kozlóvski, going
hurridly up to th unknown gnral and blocking his way to th door.
“Whom shall I announc?”
Th unknown gnral lookd disdainfully down at Kozlóvski, who was
rathr short, as if surprisd that anyon should not know him.
“Th commandr in chif is ngagd,” rpatd Kozlóvski calmly.
Th gnral’s fac cloudd, his lips quivrd and trmbld. H took
out a notbook, hurridly scribbld somthing in pncil, tor out th
laf, gav it to Kozlóvski, stppd quickly to th window, and thrw
himslf into a chair, gazing at thos in th room as if asking, “Why
do thy look at m?” Thn h liftd his had, strtchd his nck as
if h intndd to say somthing, but immdiatly, with affctd
indiffrnc, bgan to hum to himslf, producing a qur sound which
immdiatly brok off. Th door of th privat room opnd and Kutúzov
appard in th doorway. Th gnral with th bandagd had bnt forward
as though running away from som dangr, and, making long, quick strids
with his thin lgs, wnt up to Kutúzov.
“Vous voyz l malhurux Mack,” h uttrd in a brokn voic.
Kutúzov’s fac as h stood in th opn doorway rmaind prfctly
immobil for a fw momnts. Thn wrinkls ran ovr his fac lik a wav
and his forhad bcam smooth again, h bowd his had rspctfully,
closd his ys, silntly lt Mack ntr his room bfor him, and closd
th door himslf bhind him.
Th rport which had bn circulatd that th Austrians had bn batn
and that th whol army had surrndrd at Ulm provd to b corrct.
Within half an hour adjutants had bn snt in various dirctions with
ordrs which showd that th Russian troops, who had hithrto bn
inactiv, would also soon hav to mt th nmy.
Princ Andrw was on of thos rar staff officrs whos chif intrst
lay in th gnral progrss of th war. Whn h saw Mack and hard th
dtails of his disastr h undrstood that half th campaign was lost,
undrstood all th difficultis of th Russian army’s position, and
vividly imagind what awaitd it and th part h would hav to
play. Involuntarily h flt a joyful agitation at th thought of th
humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a wk’s tim h might,
prhaps, s and tak part in th first Russian ncountr with th
Frnch sinc Suvórov mt thm. H fard that Bonapart’s gnius
might outwigh all th courag of th Russian troops, and at th sam
tim could not admit th ida of his hro bing disgracd.
xcitd and irritatd by ths thoughts Princ Andrw wnt toward his
room to writ to his fathr, to whom h wrot vry day. In th corridor
h mt Nsvítski, with whom h shard a room, and th wag Zhrkóv;
thy wr as usual laughing.
“Why ar you so glum?” askd Nsvítski noticing Princ Andrw’s
pal fac and glittring ys.
“Thr’s nothing to b gay about,” answrd Bolkónski.
Just as Princ Andrw mt Nsvítski and Zhrkóv, thr cam toward
thm from th othr nd of th corridor, Strauch, an Austrian gnral
who on Kutúzov’s staff in charg of th provisioning of th Russian
army, and th mmbr of th Hofkrigsrath who had arrivd th prvious
vning. Thr was room nough in th wid corridor for th gnrals to
pass th thr officrs quit asily, but Zhrkóv, pushing Nsvítski
asid with his arm, said in a brathlss voic,
“Thy’r coming!... thy’r coming!... Stand asid, mak way,
plas mak way!”
Th gnrals wr passing by, looking as if thy wishd to avoid
mbarrassing attntions. On th fac of th wag Zhrkóv thr suddnly
appard a stupid smil of gl which h smd unabl to supprss.
“Your xcllncy,” said h in Grman, stpping forward and
addrssing th Austrian gnral, “I hav th honor to congratulat
you.”
H bowd his had and scrapd first with on foot and thn with th
othr, awkwardly, lik a child at a dancing lsson.
Th mmbr of th Hofkrigsrath lookd at him svrly but, sing th
sriousnss of his stupid smil, could not but giv him a momnt’s
attntion. H scrwd up his ys showing that h was listning.
“I hav th honor to congratulat you. Gnral Mack has arrivd, quit
wll, only a littl bruisd just hr,” h addd, pointing with a
baming smil to his had.
Th gnral frownd, turnd away, and wnt on.
“Gott, wi naiv!” * said h angrily, aftr h had gon a fw stps.
     * “Good God, what simplicity!”
Nsvítski with a laugh thrw his arms round Princ Andrw, but
Bolkónski, turning still palr, pushd him away with an angry look and
turnd to Zhrkóv. Th nrvous irritation arousd by th apparanc
of Mack, th nws of his dfat, and th thought of what lay bfor th
Russian army found vnt in angr at Zhrkóv’s untimly jst.
“If you, sir, choos to mak a buffoon of yourslf,” h said
sharply, with a slight trmbling of th lowr jaw, “I can’t prvnt
your doing so; but I warn you that if you dar to play th fool in my
prsnc, I will tach you to bhav yourslf.”
Nsvítski and Zhrkóv wr so surprisd by this outburst that thy
gazd at Bolkónski silntly with wid-opn ys.
“What’s th mattr? I only congratulatd thm,” said Zhrkóv.
“I am not jsting with you; plas b silnt!” crid Bolkónski,
and taking Nsvítski’s arm h lft Zhrkóv, who did not know what to
say.
“Com, what’s th mattr, old fllow?” said Nsvítski trying to
sooth him.
“What’s th mattr?” xclaimd Princ Andrw standing still in
his xcitmnt. “Don’t you undrstand that ithr w ar officrs
srving our Tsar and our country, rjoicing in th succsss and
griving at th misfortuns of our common caus, or w ar mrly
lackys who car nothing for thir mastr’s businss. Quarant mill

accnt—having noticd that Zhrkóv could still har him.
     * “Forty thousand mn massacrd and th army of our allis

     * (2) “It is all vry wll for that good-for-nothing fllow

H waitd a momnt to s whthr th cornt would answr, but h turnd
and wnt out of th corridor.
CHAPTR IV
Th Pávlograd Hussars wr stationd two mils from Braunau. Th
squadron in which Nicholas Rostóv srvd as a cadt was quartrd in
th Grman villag of Salznck. Th bst quartrs in th villag wr
assignd to cavalry-captain Dnísov, th squadron commandr, known
throughout th whol cavalry division as Váska Dnísov. Cadt Rostóv,
vr sinc h had ovrtakn th rgimnt in Poland, had livd with th
squadron commandr.
On Octobr 11, th day whn all was astir at hadquartrs ovr th nws
of Mack’s dfat, th camp lif of th officrs of this squadron was
procding as usual. Dnísov, who had bn losing at cards all night,
had not yt com hom whn Rostóv rod back arly in th morning from
a foraging xpdition. Rostóv in his cadt uniform, with a jrk to his
hors, rod up to th porch, swung his lg ovr th saddl with a suppl
youthful movmnt, stood for a momnt in th stirrup as if loath to
part from his hors, and at last sprang down and calld to his ordrly.
“Ah, Bondarnko, dar frind!” said h to th hussar who rushd up
hadlong to th hors. “Walk him up and down, my dar fllow,” h
continud, with that gay brothrly cordiality which goodhartd young
popl show to vryon whn thy ar happy.
“Ys, your xcllncy,” answrd th Ukrainian gaily, tossing his
had.
“Mind, walk him up and down wll!”
Anothr hussar also rushd toward th hors, but Bondarnko had alrady
thrown th rins of th snaffl bridl ovr th hors’s had. It was
vidnt that th cadt was libral with his tips and that it paid to
srv him. Rostóv pattd th hors’s nck and thn his flank, and
lingrd for a momnt.
“Splndid! What a hors h will b!” h thought with a smil, and
holding up his sabr, his spurs jingling, h ran up th stps of th
porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointd cap, pitchfork in
hand, was claring manur from th cowhous, lookd out, and his fac
immdiatly brightnd on sing Rostóv. “Schön gut Morgn! Schön
gut Morgn!” * h said winking with a mrry smil, vidntly plasd
to grt th young man.
    * “A vry good morning! A vry good morning!”
“Schon flissig?” * said Rostóv with th sam gay brothrly smil
which did not lav his agr fac. “Hoch Ostrichr! Hoch Russn!
Kaisr Alxandr hoch!” *(2) said h, quoting words oftn rpatd by
th Grman landlord.
    * “Busy alrady?”
    * (2) “Hurrah for th Austrians! Hurrah for th Russians!
     Hurrah for mpror Alxandr!”
Th Grman laughd, cam out of th cowshd, pulld off his cap, and
waving it abov his had crid:
“Und di ganz Wlt hoch!” *
    * “And hurrah for th whol world!”
Rostóv wavd his cap abov his had lik th Grman and crid laughing,
“Und vivat di ganz Wlt!” Though nithr th Grman claning his
cowshd nor Rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
rason for rjoicing, thy lookd at ach othr with joyful dlight and
brothrly lov, waggd thir hads in tokn of thir mutual affction,
and partd smiling, th Grman rturning to his cowshd and Rostóv
going to th cottag h occupid with Dnísov.
“What about your mastr?” h askd Lavrúshka, Dnísov’s ordrly,
whom all th rgimnt knw for a rogu.
“Hasn’t bn in sinc th vning. Must hav bn losing,”
answrd Lavrúshka. “I know by now, if h wins h coms back arly to
brag about it, but if h stays out till morning it mans h’s lost and
will com back in a rag. Will you hav coff?”
“Ys, bring som.”
Tn minuts latr Lavrúshka brought th coff. “H’s coming!”
said h. “Now for troubl!” Rostóv lookd out of th window and
saw Dnísov coming hom. Dnísov was a small man with a rd fac,
sparkling black ys, and black tousld mustach and hair. H wor an
unfastnd cloak, wid brchs hanging down in crass, and a crumpld
shako on th back of his had. H cam up to th porch gloomily, hanging
his had.
“Lavwúska!” h shoutd loudly and angrily, “tak it off,
blockhad!”
“Wll, I am taking it off,” rplid Lavrúshka’s voic.
“Ah, you’r up alrady,” said Dnísov, ntring th room.
“Long ago,” answrd Rostóv, “I hav alrady bn for th hay,
and hav sn Fräulin Mathild.”
“Wally! And I’v bn losing, bwothr. I lost ystrday lik a
damnd fool!” crid Dnísov, not pronouncing his r’s. “Such ill
luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you lft, it bgan and wnt on. Hullo
thr! Ta!”
Puckring up his fac though smiling, and showing his short strong
tth, h bgan with stubby fingrs of both hands to ruffl up his thick
tangld black hair.
“And what dvil mad m go to that wat?” (an officr nicknamd
“th rat”) h said, rubbing his forhad and whol fac with both
hands. “Just fancy, h didn’t lt m win a singl cahd, not on
cahd.”
H took th lightd pip that was offrd to him, grippd it in his
fist, and tappd it on th floor, making th sparks fly, whil h
continud to shout.
“H lts on win th singls and collahs it as soon as on doubls it;
givs th singls and snatchs th doubls!”
H scattrd th burning tobacco, smashd th pip, and thrw it away.
Thn h rmaind silnt for a whil, and all at onc lookd chrfully
with his glittring, black ys at Rostóv.
“If at last w had som womn hr; but thr’s nothing foh on
to do but dwink. If w could only gt to fighting soon. Hullo, who’s
thr?” h said, turning to th door as h hard a trad of havy
boots and th clinking of spurs that cam to a stop, and a rspctful
cough.
“Th squadron quartrmastr!” said Lavrúshka.
Dnísov’s fac puckrd still mor.
“Wtchd!” h muttrd, throwing down a purs with som gold in it.
“Wostóv, dah fllow, just s how much thr is lft and shov th
purs undah th pillow,” h said, and wnt out to th quartrmastr.
Rostóv took th mony and, mchanically arranging th old and nw coins
in sparat pils, bgan counting thm.
“Ah! Tlyánin! How d’y do? Thy pluckd m last night,” cam
Dnísov’s voic from th nxt room.
“Whr? At Bykov’s, at th rat’s... I knw it,” rplid a piping
voic, and Liutnant Tlyánin, a small officr of th sam squadron,
ntrd th room.
Rostóv thrust th purs undr th pillow and shook th damp littl hand
which was offrd him. Tlyánin for som rason had bn transfrrd
from th Guards just bfor this campaign. H bhavd vry wll in th
rgimnt but was not likd; Rostóv spcially dtstd him and was
unabl to ovrcom or concal his groundlss antipathy to th man.
“Wll, young cavalryman, how is my Rook bhaving?” h askd. (Rook
was a young hors Tlyánin had sold to Rostóv.)
Th liutnant nvr lookd th man h was spaking to straight in th
fac; his ys continually wandrd from on objct to anothr.
“I saw you riding this morning...” h addd.
“Oh, h’s all right, a good hors,” answrd Rostóv, though th
hors for which h had paid svn hundrd rubbls was not worth half
that sum. “H’s bgun to go a littl lam on th lft forlg,” h
addd.
“Th hoof’s crackd! That’s nothing. I’ll tach you what to do
and show you what kind of rivt to us.”
“Ys, plas do,” said Rostóv.
“I’ll show you, I’ll show you! It’s not a scrt. And it’s a
hors you’ll thank m for.”
“Thn I’ll hav it brought round,” said Rostóv wishing to avoid
Tlyánin, and h wnt out to giv th ordr.
In th passag Dnísov, with a pip, was squatting on th thrshold
facing th quartrmastr who was rporting to him. On sing Rostóv,
Dnísov scrwd up his fac and pointing ovr his shouldr with his
thumb to th room whr Tlyánin was sitting, h frownd and gav a
shuddr of disgust.
“Ugh! I don’t lik that fllow,” h said, rgardlss of th
quartrmastr’s prsnc.
Rostóv shruggd his shouldrs as much as to say: “Nor do I, but
what’s on to do?” and, having givn his ordr, h rturnd to
Tlyánin.
Tlyánin was sitting in th sam indolnt pos in which Rostóv had
lft him, rubbing his small whit hands.
“Wll thr crtainly ar disgusting popl,” thought Rostóv as h
ntrd.
“Hav you told thm to bring th hors?” askd Tlyánin, gtting up
and looking carlssly about him.
“I hav.”
“Lt us go ourslvs. I only cam round to ask Dnísov about
ystrday’s ordr. Hav you got it, Dnísov?”
“Not yt. But whr ar you off to?”
“I want to tach this young man how to sho a hors,” said
Tlyánin.
Thy wnt through th porch and into th stabl. Th liutnant
xplaind how to rivt th hoof and wnt away to his own quartrs.
Whn Rostóv wnt back thr was a bottl of vodka and a sausag on th
tabl. Dnísov was sitting thr scratching with his pn on a sht of
papr. H lookd gloomily in Rostóv’s fac and said: “I am witing
to hr.”
H land his lbows on th tabl with his pn in his hand and,
vidntly glad of a chanc to say quickr in words what h wantd to
writ, told Rostóv th contnts of his lttr.
“You s, my fwind,” h said, “w slp whn w don’t lov. W
ar childwn of th dust... but on falls in lov and on is a God, on
is pua’ as on th fihst day of cwation... Who’s that now? Snd him
to th dvil, I’m busy!” h shoutd to Lavrúshka, who wnt up to
him not in th last abashd.
“Who should it b? You yourslf told him to com. It’s th
quartrmastr for th mony.”
Dnísov frownd and was about to shout som rply but stoppd.
“Wtchd businss,” h muttrd to himslf. “How much is lft in
th puhs?” h askd, turning to Rostóv.
“Svn nw and thr old imprials.”
“Oh, it’s wtchd! Wll, what ar you standing thr for, you
sca’cwow? Call th quahthmasth,” h shoutd to Lavrúshka.
“Plas, Dnísov, lt m lnd you som: I hav som, you know,”
said Rostóv, blushing.
“Don’t lik bowwowing from my own fllows, I don’t,” growld
Dnísov.
“But if you won’t accpt mony from m lik a comrad, you will
offnd m. Rally I hav som,” Rostóv rpatd.
“No, I tll you.”
And Dnísov wnt to th bd to gt th purs from undr th pillow.
“Whr hav you put it, Wostóv?”
“Undr th lowr pillow.”
“It’s not thr.”
Dnísov thrw both pillows on th floor. Th purs was not thr.
“That’s a miwacl.”
“Wait, havn’t you droppd it?” said Rostóv, picking up th
pillows on at a tim and shaking thm.
H pulld off th quilt and shook it. Th purs was not thr.
“Dar m, can I hav forgottn? No, I rmmbr thinking that you kpt
it undr your had lik a trasur,” said Rostóv. “I put it just
hr. Whr is it?” h askd, turning to Lavrúshka.
“I havn’t bn in th room. It must b whr you put it.”
“But it isn’t?...”
“You’r always lik that; you thwow a thing down anywhr and forgt
it. Fl in your pockts.”
“No, if I hadn’t thought of it bing a trasur,” said Rostóv,
“but I rmmbr putting it thr.”
Lavrúshka turnd all th bdding ovr, lookd undr th bd and undr
th tabl, sarchd vrywhr, and stood still in th middl of th
room. Dnísov silntly watchd Lavrúshka’s movmnts, and whn th
lattr thrw up his arms in surpris saying it was nowhr to b found
Dnísov glancd at Rostóv.
“Wostóv, you’v not bn playing schoolboy twicks...”
Rostóv flt Dnísov’s gaz fixd on him, raisd his ys, and
instantly droppd thm again. All th blood which had smd congstd
somwhr blow his throat rushd to his fac and ys. H could not
draw brath.
“And thr hasn’t bn anyon in th room xcpt th liutnant and
yourslvs. It must b hr somwhr,” said Lavrúshka.
“Now thn, you dvil’s puppt, look aliv and hunt for it!”
shoutd Dnísov, suddnly, turning purpl and rushing at th man with
a thratning gstur. “If th purs isn’t found I’ll flog you,
I’ll flog you all.”
Rostóv, his ys avoiding Dnísov, bgan buttoning his coat, buckld
on his sabr, and put on his cap.
“I must hav that purs, I tll you,” shoutd Dnísov, shaking his
ordrly by th shouldrs and knocking him against th wall.
“Dnísov, lt him alon, I know who has takn it,” said Rostóv,
going toward th door without raising his ys. Dnísov pausd, thought
a momnt, and, vidntly undrstanding what Rostóv hintd at, sizd
his arm.
“Nonsns!” h crid, and th vins on his forhad and nck stood
out lik cords. “You ar mad, I tll you. I won’t allow it.
Th purs is hr! I’ll flay this scoundwl aliv, and it will b
found.”
“I know who has takn it,” rpatd Rostóv in an unstady voic,
and wnt to th door.
“And I tll you, don’t you dah to do it!” shoutd Dnísov,
rushing at th cadt to rstrain him.
But Rostóv pulld away his arm and, with as much angr as though
Dnísov wr his worst nmy, firmly fixd his ys dirctly on his
fac.
“Do you undrstand what you’r saying?” h said in a trmbling
voic. “Thr was no on ls in th room xcpt myslf. So that if it
is not so, thn...”
H could not finish, and ran out of th room.
“Ah, may th dvil tak you and vwybody,” wr th last words
Rostóv hard.
Rostóv wnt to Tlyánin’s quartrs.
“Th mastr is not in, h’s gon to hadquartrs,” said
Tlyánin’s ordrly. “Has somthing happnd?” h addd, surprisd
at th cadt’s troubld fac.
“No, nothing.”
“You’v only just missd him,” said th ordrly.
Th hadquartrs wr situatd two mils away from Salznck, and
Rostóv, without rturning hom, took a hors and rod thr. Thr was
an inn in th villag which th officrs frquntd. Rostóv rod up to
it and saw Tlyánin’s hors at th porch.
In th scond room of th inn th liutnant was sitting ovr a dish of
sausags and a bottl of win.
“Ah, you’v com hr too, young man!” h said, smiling and
raising his ybrows.
“Ys,” said Rostóv as if it cost him a grat dal to uttr th
word; and h sat down at th narst tabl.
Both wr silnt. Thr wr two Grmans and a Russian officr in th
room. No on spok and th only sounds hard wr th clattr of knivs
and th munching of th liutnant.
Whn Tlyánin had finishd his lunch h took out of his pockt a doubl
purs and, drawing its rings asid with his small, whit, turnd-up
fingrs, drw out a gold imprial, and lifting his ybrows gav it to
th waitr.
“Plas b quick,” h said.
Th coin was a nw on. Rostóv ros and wnt up to Tlyánin.
“Allow m to look at your purs,” h said in a low, almost
inaudibl, voic.
With shifting ys but ybrows still raisd, Tlyánin handd him th
purs.
“Ys, it’s a nic purs. Ys, ys,” h said, growing suddnly
pal, and addd, “Look at it, young man.”
Rostóv took th purs in his hand, xamind it and th mony in it, and
lookd at Tlyánin. Th liutnant was looking about in his usual way
and suddnly smd to grow vry mrry.
“If w gt to Vinna I’ll gt rid of it thr but in ths wrtchd
littl towns thr’s nowhr to spnd it,” said h. “Wll, lt m
hav it, young man, I’m going.”
Rostóv did not spak.
“And you? Ar you going to hav lunch too? Thy fd you quit
dcntly hr,” continud Tlyánin. “Now thn, lt m hav it.”
H strtchd out his hand to tak hold of th purs. Rostóv lt go of
it. Tlyánin took th purs and bgan carlssly slipping it into th
pockt of his riding brchs, with his ybrows liftd and his mouth
slightly opn, as if to say, “Ys, ys, I am putting my purs in my
pockt and that’s quit simpl and is no on ls’s businss.”
“Wll, young man?” h said with a sigh, and from undr his liftd
brows h glancd into Rostóv’s ys.
Som flash as of an lctric spark shot from Tlyánin’s ys to
Rostóv’s and back, and back again and again in an instant.
“Com hr,” said Rostóv, catching hold of Tlyánin’s arm and
almost dragging him to th window. “That mony is Dnísov’s; you
took it...” h whisprd just abov Tlyánin’s ar.
“What? What? How dar you? What?” said Tlyánin.
But ths words cam lik a pitous, dspairing cry and an ntraty for
pardon. As soon as Rostóv hard thm, an normous load of doubt
fll from him. H was glad, and at th sam instant bgan to pity th
misrabl man who stood bfor him, but th task h had bgun had to b
compltd.
“Havn only knows what th popl hr may imagin,” muttrd
Tlyánin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small mpty room. “W
must hav an xplanation...”
“I know it and shall prov it,” said Rostóv.
“I...”
vry muscl of Tlyánin’s pal, trrifid fac bgan to quivr, his
ys still shiftd from sid to sid but with a downward look not rising
to Rostóv’s fac, and his sobs wr audibl.
“Count!... Don’t ruin a young fllow... hr is this wrtchd mony,
tak it...” H thrw it on th tabl. “I hav an old fathr and
mothr!...”
Rostóv took th mony, avoiding Tlyánin’s ys, and wnt out of th
room without a word. But at th door h stoppd and thn rtracd his
stps. “O God,” h said with tars in his ys, “how could you do
it?”
“Count...” said Tlyánin drawing narr to him.
“Don’t touch m,” said Rostóv, drawing back. “If you nd it,
tak th mony,” and h thrw th purs to him and ran out of th inn.
CHAPTR V
That sam vning thr was an animatd discussion among th
squadron’s officrs in Dnísov’s quartrs.
“And I tll you, Rostóv, that you must apologiz to th colonl!”
said a tall, grizzly-haird staff captain, with normous mustachs and
many wrinkls on his larg faturs, to Rostóv who was crimson with
xcitmnt.
Th staff captain, Kírstn, had twic bn rducd to th ranks for
affairs of honor and had twic rgaind his commission.
“I will allow no on to call m a liar!” crid Rostóv. “H told
m I lid, and I told him h lid. And thr it rsts. H may kp m
on duty vry day, or may plac m undr arrst, but no on can mak
m apologiz, bcaus if h, as commandr of this rgimnt, thinks it
bnath his dignity to giv m satisfaction, thn...”
“You just wait a momnt, my dar fllow, and listn,” intrruptd
th staff captain in his dp bass, calmly stroking his long mustach.
“You tll th colonl in th prsnc of othr officrs that an
officr has stoln...”
“I’m not to blam that th convrsation bgan in th prsnc of
othr officrs. Prhaps I ought not to hav spokn bfor thm, but I am
not a diplomatist. That’s why I joind th hussars, thinking that hr
on would not nd finss; and h tlls m that I am lying—so lt him
giv m satisfaction...”
“That’s all right. No on thinks you a coward, but that’s not th
point. Ask Dnísov whthr it is not out of th qustion for a cadt to
dmand satisfaction of his rgimntal commandr?”
Dnísov sat gloomily biting his mustach and listning to th
convrsation, vidntly with no wish to tak part in it. H answrd th
staff captain’s qustion by a disapproving shak of his had.
“You spak to th colonl about this nasty businss bfor othr
officrs,” continud th staff captain, “and Bogdánich” (th
colonl was calld Bogdánich) “shuts you up.”
“H did not shut m up, h said I was tlling an untruth.”
“Wll, hav it so, and you talkd a lot of nonsns to him and must
apologiz.”
“Not on any account!” xclaimd Rostóv.
“I did not xpct this of you,” said th staff captain sriously and
svrly. “You don’t wish to apologiz, but, man, it’s not only to
him but to th whol rgimnt—all of us—you’r to blam all round.
Th cas is this: you ought to hav thought th mattr ovr and
takn advic; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out bfor th
officrs. Now what was th colonl to do? Hav th officr trid and
disgrac th whol rgimnt? Disgrac th whol rgimnt bcaus of on
scoundrl? Is that how you look at it? W don’t s it lik that. And
Bogdánich was a brick: h told you you wr saying what was not tru.
It’s not plasant, but what’s to b don, my dar fllow? You landd
yourslf in it. And now, whn on wants to smooth th thing ovr, som
concit prvnts your apologizing, and you wish to mak th whol
affair public. You ar offndd at bing put on duty a bit, but why not
apologiz to an old and honorabl officr? Whatvr Bogdánich may
b, anyway h is an honorabl and brav old colonl! You’r quick at
taking offns, but you don’t mind disgracing th whol rgimnt!”
Th staff captain’s voic bgan to trmbl. “You hav bn in th
rgimnt nxt to no tim, my lad, you’r hr today and tomorrow
you’ll b appointd adjutant somwhr and can snap your fingrs whn
it is said ‘Thr ar thivs among th Pávlograd officrs!’ But
it’s not all th sam to us! Am I not right, Dnísov? It’s not th
sam!”
Dnísov rmaind silnt and did not mov, but occasionally lookd with
his glittring black ys at Rostóv.
“You valu your own prid and don’t wish to apologiz,” continud
th staff captain, “but w old fllows, who hav grown up in and, God
willing, ar going to di in th rgimnt, w priz th honor of th
rgimnt, and Bogdánich knows it. Oh, w do priz it, old fllow! And
all this is not right, it’s not right! You may tak offns or not but
I always stick to mothr truth. It’s not right!”
And th staff captain ros and turnd away from Rostóv.
“That’s twu, dvil tak it!” shoutd Dnísov, jumping up. “Now
thn, Wostóv, now thn!”
Rostóv, growing rd and pal altrnatly, lookd first at on officr
and thn at th othr.
“No, gntlmn, no... you mustn’t think... I quit undrstand.
You’r wrong to think that of m... I... for m... for th honor of
th rgimnt I’d... Ah wll, I’ll show that in action, and for m
th honor of th flag... Wll, nvr mind, it’s tru I’m to blam,
to blam all round. Wll, what ls do you want?...”
“Com, that’s right, Count!” crid th staff captain, turning
round and clapping Rostóv on th shouldr with his big hand.
“I tll you,” shoutd Dnísov, “h’s a fin fllow.”
“That’s bttr, Count,” said th staff captain, bginning to
addrss Rostóv by his titl, as if in rcognition of his confssion.
“Go and apologiz, your xcllncy. Ys, go!”
“Gntlmn, I’ll do anything. No on shall har a word from m,”
said Rostóv in an imploring voic, “but I can’t apologiz, by God I
can’t, do what you will! How can I go and apologiz lik a littl boy
asking forgivnss?”
Dnísov bgan to laugh.
“It’ll b wors for you. Bogdánich is vindictiv and you’ll pay
for your obstinacy,” said Kírstn.
“No, on my word it’s not obstinacy! I can’t dscrib th fling.
I can’t...”
“Wll, it’s as you lik,” said th staff captain. “And what has
bcom of that scoundrl?” h askd Dnísov.
“H has wportd himslf sick, h’s to b stwuck off th list
tomowwow,” muttrd Dnísov.
“It is an illnss, thr’s no othr way of xplaining it,” said
th staff captain.
“Illnss or not, h’d bttr not cwoss my path. I’d kill him!”
shoutd Dnísov in a bloodthirsty ton.
Just thn Zhrkóv ntrd th room.
“What brings you hr?” crid th officrs turning to th nwcomr.
“W’r to go into action, gntlmn! Mack has surrndrd with his

“It’s not tru!”
“I’v sn him myslf!”

“Into action! Into action! Bring him a bottl for such nws! But how

“I’v bn snt back to th rgimnt all on account of that dvil,

“Oh, my dar fllow, w’r in such a stw hr ths last two

Th rgimntal adjutant cam in and confirmd th nws brought by

CHAPTR VI
Kutúzov fll back toward Vinna, dstroying bhind him th bridgs ovr
th rivrs Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (nar Linz). On Octobr 23 th
Russian troops wr crossing th rivr nns. At midday th Russian
baggag train, th artillry, and columns of troops wr dfiling
through th town of nns on both sids of th bridg.
It was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. Th wid xpans that opnd out
bfor th hights on which th Russian battris stood guarding th
bridg was at tims vild by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and
thn, suddnly sprad out in th sunlight, far-distant objcts could
b clarly sn glittring as though frshly varnishd. Down blow,
th littl town could b sn with its whit, rd-roofd houss, its
cathdral, and its bridg, on both sids of which stramd jostling
masss of Russian troops. At th bnd of th Danub, vssls, an island,
and a castl with a park surroundd by th watrs of th conflunc of
th nns and th Danub bcam visibl, and th rocky lft bank of th
Danub covrd with pin forsts, with a mystic background of grn
trtops and bluish gorgs. Th turrts of a convnt stood out byond a
wild virgin pin forst, and far away on th othr sid of th nns th
nmy’s hors patrols could b discrnd.
Among th fild guns on th brow of th hill th gnral in command of
th rarguard stood with a staff officr, scanning th country through
his fildglass. A littl bhind thm Nsvítski, who had bn snt to
th rarguard by th commandr in chif, was sitting on th trail of a
gun carriag. A Cossack who accompanid him had handd him a knapsack
and a flask, and Nsvítski was trating som officrs to pis and ral
dopplkümml. Th officrs gladly gathrd round him, som on thir
kns, som squatting Turkish fashion on th wt grass.
“Ys, th Austrian princ who built that castl was no fool. It’s
a fin plac! Why ar you not ating anything, gntlmn?” Nsvítski
was saying.
“Thank you vry much, Princ,” answrd on of th officrs, plasd
to b talking to a staff officr of such importanc. “It’s a lovly
plac! W passd clos to th park and saw two dr... and what a
splndid hous!”
“Look, Princ,” said anothr, who would hav darly likd to tak
anothr pi but flt shy, and thrfor prtndd to b xamining th
countrysid—“S, our infantrymn hav alrady got thr. Look thr
in th madow bhind th villag, thr of thm ar dragging somthing.
Thy’ll ransack that castl,” h rmarkd with vidnt approval.
“So thy will,” said Nsvítski. “No, but what I should lik,”
addd h, munching a pi in his moist-lippd handsom mouth, “would b
to slip in ovr thr.”
H pointd with a smil to a turrtd nunnry, and his ys narrowd and
glamd.
“That would b fin, gntlmn!”
Th officrs laughd.
“Just to fluttr th nuns a bit. Thy say thr ar Italian girls
among thm. On my word I’d giv fiv yars of my lif for it!”
“Thy must b fling dull, too,” said on of th boldr officrs,
laughing.
Manwhil th staff officr standing in front pointd out somthing to
th gnral, who lookd through his fild glass.
“Ys, so it is, so it is,” said th gnral angrily, lowring th
fild glass and shrugging his shouldrs, “so it is! Thy’ll b fird
on at th crossing. And why ar thy dawdling thr?”
On th opposit sid th nmy could b sn by th nakd y, and from
thir battry a milk-whit cloud aros. Thn cam th distant rport of
a shot, and our troops could b sn hurrying to th crossing.
Nsvítski ros, puffing, and wnt up to th gnral, smiling.
“Would not your xcllncy lik a littl rfrshmnt?” h said.
“It’s a bad businss,” said th gnral without answring him,
“our mn hav bn wasting tim.”
“Hadn’t I bttr rid ovr, your xcllncy?” askd Nsvítski.
“Ys, plas do,” answrd th gnral, and h rpatd th ordr
that had alrady onc bn givn in dtail: “and tll th hussars
that thy ar to cross last and to fir th bridg as I ordrd; and th
inflammabl matrial on th bridg must b rinspctd.”
“Vry good,” answrd Nsvítski.
H calld th Cossack with his hors, told him to put away th knapsack
and flask, and swung his havy prson asily into th saddl.
“I’ll rally call in on th nuns,” h said to th officrs who
watchd him smilingly, and h rod off by th winding path down th
hill.
“Now thn, lt’s s how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!”
said th gnral, turning to an artillry officr. “Hav a littl fun
to pass th tim.”
“Crw, to your guns!” commandd th officr.
In a momnt th mn cam running gaily from thir campfirs and bgan
loading.
“On!” cam th command.
Numbr on jumpd briskly asid. Th gun rang out with a dafning
mtallic roar, and a whistling grnad flw abov th hads of our
troops blow th hill and fll far short of th nmy, a littl smok
showing th spot whr it burst.
Th facs of officrs and mn brightnd up at th sound. vryon got
up and bgan watching th movmnts of our troops blow, as plainly
visibl as if but a ston’s throw away, and th movmnts of th
approaching nmy farthr off. At th sam instant th sun cam fully
out from bhind th clouds, and th clar sound of th solitary shot
and th brillianc of th bright sunshin mrgd in a singl joyous and
spiritd imprssion.
CHAPTR VII
Two of th nmy’s shots had alrady flown across th bridg, whr
thr was a crush. Halfway across stood Princ Nsvítski, who had
alightd from his hors and whos big body was jammd against th
railings. H lookd back laughing to th Cossack who stood a fw
stps bhind him holding two horss by thir bridls. ach tim Princ
Nsvítski trid to mov on, soldirs and carts pushd him back again
and prssd him against th railings, and all h could do was to smil.
“What a fin fllow you ar, frind!” said th Cossack to a convoy
soldir with a wagon, who was prssing onto th infantrymn who wr
crowdd togthr clos to his whls and his horss. “What a fllow!
You can’t wait a momnt! Don’t you s th gnral wants to pass?”
But th convoyman took no notic of th word “gnral” and shoutd
at th soldirs who wr blocking his way. “Hi thr, boys! Kp to
th lft! Wait a bit.” But th soldirs, crowdd togthr shouldr to
shouldr, thir bayonts intrlocking, movd ovr th bridg in a dns
mass. Looking down ovr th rails Princ Nsvítski saw th rapid, noisy
littl wavs of th nns, which rippling and ddying round th pils of
th bridg chasd ach othr along. Looking on th bridg h saw qually
uniform living wavs of soldirs, shouldr straps, covrd shakos,
knapsacks, bayonts, long muskts, and, undr th shakos, facs with
broad chkbons, sunkn chks, and listlss tird xprssions, and
ft that movd through th sticky mud that covrd th planks of th
bridg. Somtims through th monotonous wavs of mn, lik a flck of
whit foam on th wavs of th nns, an officr, in a cloak and with
a typ of fac diffrnt from that of th mn, squzd his way along;
somtims lik a chip of wood whirling in th rivr, an hussar on foot,
an ordrly, or a townsman was carrid through th wavs of infantry;
and somtims lik a log floating down th rivr, an officrs’ or
company’s baggag wagon, pild high, lathr covrd, and hmmd in on
all sids, movd across th bridg.
“It’s as if a dam had burst,” said th Cossack hoplssly. “Ar
thr many mor of you to com?”
“A million all but on!” rplid a waggish soldir in a torn coat,
with a wink, and passd on followd by anothr, an old man.
“If h” (h mant th nmy) “bgins popping at th bridg now,”
said th old soldir dismally to a comrad, “you’ll forgt to
scratch yourslf.”
That soldir passd on, and aftr him cam anothr sitting on a cart.
“Whr th dvil hav th lg bands bn shovd to?” said an
ordrly, running bhind th cart and fumbling in th back of it.
And h also passd on with th wagon. Thn cam som mrry soldirs who
had vidntly bn drinking.
“And thn, old fllow, h givs him on in th tth with th butt
nd of his gun...” a soldir whos gratcoat was wll tuckd up said
gaily, with a wid swing of his arm.
“Ys, th ham was just dlicious...” answrd anothr with a loud
laugh. And thy, too, passd on, so that Nsvítski did not larn who
had bn struck on th tth, or what th ham had to do with it.
“Bah! How thy scurry. H just snds a ball and thy think thy’ll
all b killd,” a srgant was saying angrily and rproachfully.
“As it flis past m, Daddy, th ball I man,” said a young soldir
with an normous mouth, hardly rfraining from laughing, “I flt lik
dying of fright. I did, ‘pon my word, I got that frightnd!” said
h, as if bragging of having bn frightnd.
That on also passd. Thn followd a cart unlik any that had gon
bfor. It was a Grman cart with a pair of horss ld by a Grman, and
smd loadd with a whol housful of ffcts. A fin brindld cow with
a larg uddr was attachd to th cart bhind. A woman with an unwand
baby, an old woman, and a halthy Grman girl with bright rd chks
wr sitting on som fathr bds. vidntly ths fugitivs wr
allowd to pass by spcial prmission. Th ys of all th soldirs
turnd toward th womn, and whil th vhicl was passing at foot pac
all th soldirs’ rmarks rlatd to th two young ons. vry fac
bor almost th sam smil, xprssing unsmly thoughts about th
womn.
“Just s, th Grman sausag is making tracks, too!”
“Sll m th missis,” said anothr soldir, addrssing th Grman,
who, angry and frightnd, strod nrgtically along with downcast
ys.
“S how smart sh’s mad hrslf! Oh, th dvils!”
“Thr, Fdótov, you should b quartrd on thm!”
“I hav sn as much bfor now, mat!”
“Whr ar you going?” askd an infantry officr who was ating an
appl, also half smiling as h lookd at th handsom girl.
Th Grman closd his ys, signifying that h did not undrstand.
“Tak it if you lik,” said th officr, giving th girl an appl.
Th girl smild and took it. Nsvítski lik th rst of th mn on th
bridg did not tak his ys off th womn till thy had passd. Whn
thy had gon by, th sam stram of soldirs followd, with th sam
kind of talk, and at last all stoppd. As oftn happns, th horss of
a convoy wagon bcam rstiv at th nd of th bridg, and th whol
crowd had to wait.
“And why ar thy stopping? Thr’s no propr ordr!” said th
soldirs. “Whr ar you shoving to? Dvil tak you! Can’t you wait?
It’ll b wors if h firs th bridg. S, hr’s an officr jammd
in too”—diffrnt voics wr saying in th crowd, as th mn lookd
at on anothr, and all prssd toward th xit from th bridg.
Looking down at th watrs of th nns undr th bridg, Nsvítski
suddnly hard a sound nw to him, of somthing swiftly approaching...
somthing big, that splashd into th watr.
“Just s whr it carris to!” a soldir nar by said strnly,
looking round at th sound.
“ncouraging us to gt along quickr,” said anothr unasily.
Th crowd movd on again. Nsvítski ralizd that it was a cannon ball.
“Hy, Cossack, my hors!” h said. “Now, thn, you thr! gt out
of th way! Mak way!”
With grat difficulty h managd to gt to his hors, and shouting
continually h movd on. Th soldirs squzd thmslvs to mak way
for him, but again prssd on him so that thy jammd his lg, and thos
narst him wr not to blam for thy wr thmslvs prssd still
hardr from bhind.
“Nsvítski, Nsvítski! you numskull!” cam a hoars voic from
bhind him.
Nsvítski lookd round and saw, som fiftn pacs away but sparatd
by th living mass of moving infantry, Váska Dnísov, rd and shaggy,
with his cap on th back of his black had and a cloak hanging jauntily
ovr his shouldr.
“Tll ths dvils, ths finds, to lt m pass!” shoutd Dnísov
vidntly in a fit of rag, his coal-black ys with thir bloodshot
whits glittring and rolling as h wavd his shathd sabr in a small
bar hand as rd as his fac.
“Ah, Váska!” joyfully rplid Nsvítski. “What’s up with
you?”
“Th squadwon can’t pass,” shoutd Váska Dnísov, showing his
whit tth fircly and spurring his black thoroughbrd Arab, which
twitchd its ars as th bayonts touchd it, and snortd, spurting
whit foam from his bit, tramping th planks of th bridg with his
hoofs, and apparntly rady to jump ovr th railings had his ridr lt
him. “What is this? Thy’r lik shp! Just lik shp! Out of th
way!... Lt us pass!... Stop thr, you dvil with th cart! I’ll hack
you with my sabr!” h shoutd, actually drawing his sabr from its
scabbard and flourishing it.
Th soldirs crowdd against on anothr with trrifid facs, and
Dnísov joind Nsvítski.
“How’s it you’r not drunk today?” said Nsvítski whn th
othr had riddn up to him.
“Thy don’t vn giv on tim to dwink!” answrd Váska
Dnísov. “Thy kp dwagging th wgimnt to and fwo all day. If thy
man to fight, lt’s fight. But th dvil knows what this is.”
“What a dandy you ar today!” said Nsvítski, looking at
Dnísov’s nw cloak and saddlcloth.
Dnísov smild, took out of his sabrtach a handkrchif that diffusd
a smll of prfum, and put it to Nsvítski’s nos.
“Of cours. I’m going into action! I’v shavd, bwushd my tth,
and scntd myslf.”
Th imposing figur of Nsvítski followd by his Cossack, and
th dtrmination of Dnísov who flourishd his sword and shoutd
frantically, had such an ffct that thy managd to squz through
to th farthr sid of th bridg and stoppd th infantry. Bsid th
bridg Nsvítski found th colonl to whom h had to dlivr th ordr,
and having don this h rod back.
Having clard th way Dnísov stoppd at th nd of th bridg.
Carlssly holding in his stallion that was nighing and pawing th
ground, agr to rjoin its fllows, h watchd his squadron draw
narr. Thn th clang of hoofs, as of svral horss galloping,
rsoundd on th planks of th bridg, and th squadron, officrs in
front and mn four abrast, sprad across th bridg and bgan to mrg
on his sid of it.
Th infantry who had bn stoppd crowdd nar th bridg in th
trampld mud and gazd with that particular fling of ill-will,
strangmnt, and ridicul with which troops of diffrnt arms usually
ncountr on anothr at th clan, smart hussars who movd past thm in
rgular ordr.
“Smart lads! Only fit for a fair!” said on.
“What good ar thy? Thy’r ld about just for show!” rmarkd
anothr.
“Don’t kick up th dust, you infantry!” jstd an hussar whos
prancing hors had splashd mud ovr som foot soldirs.
“I’d lik to put you on a two days’ march with a knapsack! Your
fin cords would soon gt a bit rubbd,” said an infantryman, wiping
th mud off his fac with his slv. “Prchd up thr, you’r mor
lik a bird than a man.”
“Thr now, Zíkin, thy ought to put you on a hors. You’d look
fin,” said a corporal, chaffing a thin littl soldir who bnt undr
th wight of his knapsack.
“Tak a stick btwn your lgs, that’ll suit you for a hors!”
th hussar shoutd back.
CHAPTR VIII
Th last of th infantry hurridly crossd th bridg, squzing
togthr as thy approachd it as if passing through a funnl. At last
th baggag wagons had all crossd, th crush was lss, and th last
battalion cam onto th bridg. Only Dnísov’s squadron of hussars
rmaind on th farthr sid of th bridg facing th nmy, who could
b sn from th hill on th opposit bank but was not yt visibl from
th bridg, for th horizon as sn from th vally through which th
rivr flowd was formd by th rising ground only half a mil away.
At th foot of th hill lay wastland ovr which a fw groups of our
Cossack scouts wr moving. Suddnly on th road at th top of th high
ground, artillry and troops in blu uniform wr sn. Ths wr th
Frnch. A group of Cossack scouts rtird down th hill at a trot. All
th officrs and mn of Dnísov’s squadron, though thy trid to talk
of othr things and to look in othr dirctions, thought only of what
was thr on th hilltop, and kpt constantly looking at th patchs
apparing on th skylin, which thy knw to b th nmy’s troops.
Th wathr had clard again sinc noon and th sun was dscnding
brightly upon th Danub and th dark hills around it. It was calm, and
at intrvals th bugl calls and th shouts of th nmy could b hard
from th hill. Thr was no on now btwn th squadron and th nmy
xcpt a fw scattrd skirmishrs. An mpty spac of som svn hundrd
yards was all that sparatd thm. Th nmy casd firing, and that
strn, thratning, inaccssibl, and intangibl lin which sparats
two hostil armis was all th mor clarly flt.
“On stp byond that boundary lin which rsmbls th lin dividing
th living from th dad lis uncrtainty, suffring, and dath. And
what is thr? Who is thr?—thr byond that fild, that tr, that
roof lit up by th sun? No on knows, but on wants to know. You far
and yt long to cross that lin, and know that soonr or latr it must
b crossd and you will hav to find out what is thr, just as you will
invitably hav to larn what lis th othr sid of dath. But you ar
strong, halthy, chrful, and xcitd, and ar surroundd by othr such
xcitdly animatd and halthy mn.” So thinks, or at any rat
fls, anyon who coms in sight of th nmy, and that fling givs
a particular glamour and glad knnss of imprssion to vrything that
taks plac at such momnts.
On th high ground whr th nmy was, th smok of a cannon ros,
and a ball flw whistling ovr th hads of th hussar squadron. Th
officrs who had bn standing togthr rod off to thir placs. Th
hussars bgan carfully aligning thir horss. Silnc fll on th whol
squadron. All wr looking at th nmy in front and at th squadron
commandr, awaiting th word of command. A scond and a third cannon
ball flw past. vidntly thy wr firing at th hussars, but th balls
with rapid rhythmic whistl flw ovr th hads of th horsmn and fll
somwhr byond thm. Th hussars did not look round, but at th sound
of ach shot, as at th word of command, th whol squadron with its
rows of facs so alik yt so diffrnt, holding its brath whil th
ball flw past, ros in th stirrups and sank back again. Th soldirs
without turning thir hads glancd at on anothr, curious to s thir
comrads’ imprssion. vry fac, from Dnísov’s to that of th
buglr, showd on common xprssion of conflict, irritation, and
xcitmnt, around chin and mouth. Th quartrmastr frownd, looking
at th soldirs as if thratning to punish thm. Cadt Mirónov duckd
vry tim a ball flw past. Rostóv on th lft flank, mountd on his
Rook—a handsom hors dspit its gam lg—had th happy air of a
schoolboy calld up bfor a larg audinc for an xamination in which
h fls sur h will distinguish himslf. H was glancing at vryon
with a clar, bright xprssion, as if asking thm to notic how calmly
h sat undr fir. But dspit himslf, on his fac too that sam
indication of somthing nw and strn showd round th mouth.
“Who’s that curtsying thr? Cadt Miwónov! That’s not wight!
Look at m,” crid Dnísov who, unabl to kp still on on spot,
kpt turning his hors in front of th squadron.
Th black, hairy, snub-nosd fac of Váska Dnísov, and his whol
short sturdy figur with th sinwy hairy hand and stumpy fingrs in
which h hld th hilt of his nakd sabr, lookd just as it usually
did, spcially toward vning whn h had mptid his scond bottl; h
was only rddr than usual. With his shaggy had thrown back lik birds
whn thy drink, prssing his spurs mrcilssly into th sids of his
good hors, Bdouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in th
saddl, h gallopd to th othr flank of th squadron and shoutd in
a hoars voic to th mn to look to thir pistols. H rod up to
Kírstn. Th staff captain on his broad-backd, stady mar cam at a
walk to mt him. His fac with its long mustach was srious as always,
only his ys wr brightr than usual.
“Wll, what about it?” said h to Dnísov. “It won’t com to a
fight. You’ll s—w shall rtir.”
“Th dvil only knows what thy’r about!” muttrd Dnísov.
“Ah, Wostóv,” h crid noticing th cadt’s bright fac,
“you’v got it at last.”
And h smild approvingly, vidntly plasd with th cadt. Rostóv
flt prfctly happy. Just thn th commandr appard on th bridg.
Dnísov gallopd up to him.
“Your xcllncy! Lt us attack thm! I’ll dwiv thm off.”
“Attack indd!” said th colonl in a bord voic, puckring up his
fac as if driving off a troublsom fly. “And why ar you stopping
hr? Don’t you s th skirmishrs ar rtrating? Lad th squadron
back.”
Th squadron crossd th bridg and drw out of rang of fir without
having lost a singl man. Th scond squadron that had bn in th front
lin followd thm across and th last Cossacks quittd th farthr sid
of th rivr.
Th two Pávlograd squadrons, having crossd th bridg, rtird up th
hill on aftr th othr. Thir colonl, Karl Bogdánich Schubrt, cam
up to Dnísov’s squadron and rod at a footpac not far from Rostóv,
without taking any notic of him although thy wr now mting for th
first tim sinc thir ncountr concrning Tlyánin. Rostóv, fling
that h was at th front and in th powr of a man toward whom h now
admittd that h had bn to blam, did not lift his ys from th
colonl’s athltic back, his nap covrd with light hair, and his rd
nck. It smd to Rostóv that Bogdánich was only prtnding not
to notic him, and that his whol aim now was to tst th cadt’s
courag, so h drw himslf up and lookd around him mrrily; thn it
smd to him that Bogdánich rod so nar in ordr to show him his
courag. Nxt h thought that his nmy would snd th squadron on a
dsprat attack just to punish him—Rostóv. Thn h imagind how,
aftr th attack, Bogdánich would com up to him as h lay woundd and
would magnanimously xtnd th hand of rconciliation.
Th high-shouldrd figur of Zhrkóv, familiar to th Pávlograds as
h had but rcntly lft thir rgimnt, rod up to th colonl.
Aftr his dismissal from hadquartrs Zhrkóv had not rmaind in th
rgimnt, saying h was not such a fool as to slav at th front whn h
could gt mor rwards by doing nothing on th staff, and had succdd
in attaching himslf as an ordrly officr to Princ Bagratión. H now
cam to his formr chif with an ordr from th commandr of th rar
guard.
“Colonl,” h said, addrssing Rostóv’s nmy with an air of
gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrads, “thr is an ordr
to stop and fir th bridg.”
“An ordr to who?” askd th colonl morosly.
“I don’t myslf know ‘to who,’” rplid th cornt in a
srious ton, “but th princ told m to ‘go and tll th colonl
that th hussars must rturn quickly and fir th bridg.’”
Zhrkóv was followd by an officr of th suit who rod up to th
colonl of hussars with th sam ordr. Aftr him th stout Nsvítski
cam galloping up on a Cossack hors that could scarcly carry his
wight.
“How’s this, Colonl?” h shoutd as h approachd. “I told you
to fir th bridg, and now somon has gon and blundrd; thy ar all
bsid thmslvs ovr thr and on can’t mak anything out.”
Th colonl dlibratly stoppd th rgimnt and turnd to Nsvítski.
“You spok to m of inflammabl matrial,” said h, “but you said
nothing about firing it.”
“But, my dar sir,” said Nsvítski as h drw up, taking off his
cap and smoothing his hair wt with prspiration with his plump hand,
“wasn’t I tlling you to fir th bridg, whn inflammabl matrial
had bn put in position?”
“I am not your ‘dar sir,’ Mr. Staff Officr, and you did not tll
m to burn th bridg! I know th srvic, and it is my habit ordrs
strictly to oby. You said th bridg would b burnd, but who would it
burn, I could not know by th holy spirit!”
“Ah, that’s always th way!” said Nsvítski with a wav of th
hand. “How did you gt hr?” said h, turning to Zhrkóv.
“On th sam businss. But you ar damp! Lt m wring you out!”
“You wr saying, Mr. Staff Officr...” continud th colonl in an
offndd ton.
“Colonl,” intrruptd th officr of th suit, “You must b
quick or th nmy will bring up his guns to us grapshot.”
Th colonl lookd silntly at th officr of th suit, at th stout
staff officr, and at Zhrkóv, and h frownd.
“I will th bridg fir,” h said in a solmn ton as if to announc
that in spit of all th unplasantnss h had to ndur h would still
do th right thing.
Striking his hors with his long muscular lgs as if it wr to blam
for vrything, th colonl movd forward and ordrd th scond
squadron, that in which Rostóv was srving undr Dnísov, to rturn to
th bridg.
“Thr, it’s just as I thought,” said Rostóv to himslf. “H
wishs to tst m!” His hart contractd and th blood rushd to his
fac. “Lt him s whthr I am a coward!” h thought.
Again on all th bright facs of th squadron th srious xprssion
appard that thy had worn whn undr fir. Rostóv watchd his nmy,
th colonl, closly—to find in his fac confirmation of his own
conjctur, but th colonl did not onc glanc at Rostóv, and lookd
as h always did whn at th front, solmn and strn. Thn cam th word
of command.
“Look sharp! Look sharp!” svral voics rpatd around him.
Thir sabrs catching in th bridls and thir spurs jingling, th
hussars hastily dismountd, not knowing what thy wr to do. Th mn
wr crossing thmslvs. Rostóv no longr lookd at th colonl, h
had no tim. H was afraid of falling bhind th hussars, so much afraid
that his hart stood still. His hand trmbld as h gav his hors into
an ordrly’s charg, and h flt th blood rush to his hart with
a thud. Dnísov rod past him, laning back and shouting somthing.
Rostóv saw nothing but th hussars running all around him, thir spurs
catching and thir sabrs clattring.
“Strtchrs!” shoutd somon bhind him.
Rostóv did not think what this call for strtchrs mant; h ran on,
trying only to b ahad of th othrs; but just at th bridg, not
looking at th ground, h cam on som sticky, troddn mud, stumbld,
and fll on his hands. Th othrs outstrippd him.
“At boss zids, Captain,” h hard th voic of th colonl, who,
having riddn ahad, had pulld up his hors nar th bridg, with a
triumphant, chrful fac.
Rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his brchs lookd at his nmy and
was about to run on, thinking that th farthr h wnt to th front
th bttr. But Bogdánich, without looking at or rcognizing Rostóv,
shoutd to him:
“Who’s that running on th middl of th bridg? To th right! Com
back, Cadt!” h crid angrily; and turning to Dnísov, who, showing
off his courag, had riddn on to th planks of th bridg:
“Why run risks, Captain? You should dismount,” h said.
“Oh, vry bullt has its billt,” answrd Váska Dnísov, turning
in his saddl.
Manwhil Nsvítski, Zhrkóv, and th officr of th suit wr
standing togthr out of rang of th shots, watching, now th small
group of mn with yllow shakos, dark-grn jackts braidd with cord,
and blu riding brchs, who wr swarming nar th bridg, and thn at
what was approaching in th distanc from th opposit sid—th blu
uniforms and groups with horss, asily rcognizabl as artillry.
“Will thy burn th bridg or not? Who’ll gt thr first? Will thy
gt thr and fir th bridg or will th Frnch gt within grapshot
rang and wip thm out?” Ths wr th qustions ach man of th
troops on th high ground abov th bridg involuntarily askd himslf
with a sinking hart—watching th bridg and th hussars in th bright
vning light and th blu tunics advancing from th othr sid with
thir bayonts and guns.
“Ugh. Th hussars will gt it hot!” said Nsvítski; “thy ar
within grapshot rang now.”
“H shouldn’t hav takn so many mn,” said th officr of th
suit.
“Tru nough,” answrd Nsvítski; “two smart fllows could hav
don th job just as wll.”
“Ah, your xcllncy,” put in Zhrkóv, his ys fixd on th
hussars, but still with that naïv air that mad it impossibl to know
whthr h was spaking in jst or in arnst. “Ah, your xcllncy!
How you look at things! Snd two mn? And who thn would giv us th
Vladímir mdal and ribbon? But now, vn if thy do gt ppprd, th
squadron may b rcommndd for honors and h may gt a ribbon. Our
Bogdánich knows how things ar don.”
“Thr now!” said th officr of th suit, “that’s
grapshot.”
H pointd to th Frnch guns, th limbrs of which wr bing dtachd
and hurridly rmovd.
On th Frnch sid, amid th groups with cannon, a cloud of smok
appard, thn a scond and a third almost simultanously, and at th
momnt whn th first rport was hard a fourth was sn. Thn two
rports on aftr anothr, and a third.
“Oh! Oh!” groand Nsvítski as if in firc pain, sizing th
officr of th suit by th arm. “Look! A man has falln! Falln,
falln!”
“Two, I think.”
“If I wr Tsar I would nvr go to war,” said Nsvítski, turning
away.
Th Frnch guns wr hastily rloadd. Th infantry in thir blu
uniforms advancd toward th bridg at a run. Smok appard again
but at irrgular intrvals, and grapshot crackd and rattld onto th
bridg. But this tim Nsvítski could not s what was happning thr,
as a dns cloud of smok aros from it. Th hussars had succdd in
stting it on fir and th Frnch battris wr now firing at thm, no
longr to hindr thm but bcaus th guns wr traind and thr was
somon to fir at.
Th Frnch had tim to fir thr rounds of grapshot bfor th hussars
got back to thir horss. Two wr misdirctd and th shot wnt too
high, but th last round fll in th midst of a group of hussars and
knockd thr of thm ovr.
Rostóv, absorbd by his rlations with Bogdánich, had pausd on th
bridg not knowing what to do. Thr was no on to hw down (as h
had always imagind battls to himslf), nor could h hlp to fir th
bridg bcaus h had not brought any burning straw with him lik th
othr soldirs. H stood looking about him, whn suddnly h hard a
rattl on th bridg as if nuts wr bing spilt, and th hussar narst
to him fll against th rails with a groan. Rostóv ran up to him with
th othrs. Again somon shoutd, “Strtchrs!” Four mn sizd th
hussar and bgan lifting him.
“Oooh! For Christ’s sak lt m alon!” crid th woundd man, but
still h was liftd and laid on th strtchr.
Nicholas Rostóv turnd away and, as if sarching for somthing, gazd
into th distanc, at th watrs of th Danub, at th sky, and at th
sun. How bautiful th sky lookd; how blu, how calm, and how dp!
How bright and glorious was th stting sun! With what soft glittr th
watrs of th distant Danub shon. And fairr still wr th faraway
blu mountains byond th rivr, th nunnry, th mystrious gorgs, and
th pin forsts vild in th mist of thir summits... Thr was pac
and happinss... “I should wish for nothing ls, nothing, if only I
wr thr,” thought Rostóv. “In myslf alon and in that sunshin
thr is so much happinss; but hr... groans, suffring, far, and
this uncrtainty and hurry... Thr—thy ar shouting again, and
again ar all running back somwhr, and I shall run with thm, and it,
dath, is hr abov m and around... Anothr instant and I shall nvr
again s th sun, this watr, that gorg!...”
At that instant th sun bgan to hid bhind th clouds, and othr
strtchrs cam into viw bfor Rostóv. And th far of dath and of
th strtchrs, and lov of th sun and of lif, all mrgd into on
fling of sickning agitation.
“O Lord God! Thou who art in that havn, sav, forgiv, and protct
m!” Rostóv whisprd.
Th hussars ran back to th mn who hld thir horss; thir voics
soundd loudr and calmr, th strtchrs disappard from sight.
“Wll, fwind? So you’v smlt powdah!” shoutd Váska Dnísov
just abov his ar.
“It’s all ovr; but I am a coward—ys, a coward!” thought
Rostóv, and sighing dply h took Rook, his hors, which stood rsting
on foot, from th ordrly and bgan to mount.
“Was that grapshot?” h askd Dnísov.
“Ys and no mistak!” crid Dnísov. “You workd lik wgular
bwicks and it’s nasty work! An attack’s plasant work! Hacking
away at th dogs! But this sort of thing is th vry dvil, with thm
shooting at you lik a targt.”
And Dnísov rod up to a group that had stoppd nar Rostóv, composd
of th colonl, Nsvítski, Zhrkóv, and th officr from th suit.
“Wll, it sms that no on has noticd,” thought Rostóv. And this
was tru. No on had takn any notic, for vryon knw th snsation
which th cadt undr fir for th first tim had xprincd.
“Hr’s somthing for you to rport,” said Zhrkóv. “S if I
don’t gt promotd to a subliutnancy.”
“Inform th princ that I th bridg fird!” said th colonl
triumphantly and gaily.
“And if h asks about th losss?”
“A trifl,” said th colonl in his bass voic: “two hussars
woundd, and on knockd out,” h addd, unabl to rstrain a happy
smil, and pronouncing th phras “knockd out” with ringing
distinctnss.
CHAPTR IX
Pursud by th Frnch army of a hundrd thousand mn undr th command
of Bonapart, ncountring a population that was unfrindly to it,
losing confidnc in its allis, suffring from shortnss of supplis,
and complld to act undr conditions of war unlik anything that had
bn forsn, th Russian army of thirty-fiv thousand mn commandd
by Kutúzov was hurridly rtrating along th Danub, stopping whr
ovrtakn by th nmy and fighting rarguard actions only as far as
ncssary to nabl it to rtrat without losing its havy quipmnt.
Thr had bn actions at Lambach, Amstttn, and Mlk; but dspit th
courag and nduranc—acknowldgd vn by th nmy—with which th
Russians fought, th only consqunc of ths actions was a yt mor
rapid rtrat. Austrian troops that had scapd captur at Ulm and had
joind Kutúzov at Braunau now sparatd from th Russian army, and
Kutúzov was lft with only his own wak and xhaustd forcs. Th
dfns of Vinna was no longr to b thought of. Instad of an
offnsiv, th plan of which, carfully prpard in accord with th
modrn scinc of stratgics, had bn handd to Kutúzov whn h was in
Vinna by th Austrian Hofkrigsrath, th sol and almost unattainabl
aim rmaining for him was to ffct a junction with th forcs that wr
advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had don at Ulm.
On th twnty-ighth of Octobr Kutúzov with his army crossd to th
lft bank of th Danub and took up a position for th first tim
with th rivr btwn himslf and th main body of th Frnch. On th
thirtith h attackd Mortir’s division, which was on th lft bank,
and brok it up. In this action for th first tim trophis wr takn:
bannrs, cannon, and two nmy gnrals. For th first tim, aftr a
fortnight’s rtrat, th Russian troops had haltd and aftr a fight
had not only hld th fild but had rpulsd th Frnch. Though th
troops wr ill-clad, xhaustd, and had lost a third of thir numbr
in killd, woundd, sick, and stragglrs; though a numbr of sick and
woundd had bn abandond on th othr sid of th Danub with a lttr
in which Kutúzov ntrustd thm to th humanity of th nmy; and
though th big hospitals and th houss in Krms convrtd into military
hospitals could no longr accommodat all th sick and woundd, yt th
stand mad at Krms and th victory ovr Mortir raisd th spirits of
th army considrably. Throughout th whol army and at hadquartrs
most joyful though rronous rumors wr rif of th imaginary approach
of columns from Russia, of som victory gaind by th Austrians, and of
th rtrat of th frightnd Bonapart.
Princ Andrw during th battl had bn in attndanc on th Austrian
Gnral Schmidt, who was killd in th action. His hors had bn
woundd undr him and his own arm slightly grazd by a bullt. As a mark
of th commandr in chif’s spcial favor h was snt with th nws of
this victory to th Austrian court, now no longr at Vinna (which was
thratnd by th Frnch) but at Brünn. Dspit his apparntly dlicat
build Princ Andrw could ndur physical fatigu far bttr than many
vry muscular mn, and on th night of th battl, having arrivd
at Krms xcitd but not wary, with dispatchs from Dokhtúrov to
Kutúzov, h was snt immdiatly with a spcial dispatch to Brünn.
To b so snt mant not only a rward but an important stp toward
promotion.
Th night was dark but starry, th road showd black in th snow that
had falln th prvious day—th day of th battl. Rviwing his
imprssions of th rcnt battl, picturing plasantly to himslf th
imprssion his nws of a victory would crat, or rcalling th snd-off
givn him by th commandr in chif and his fllow officrs, Princ
Andrw was galloping along in a post chais njoying th flings of a
man who has at lngth bgun to attain a long-dsird happinss. As soon
as h closd his ys his ars smd filld with th rattl of th
whls and th snsation of victory. Thn h bgan to imagin that
th Russians wr running away and that h himslf was killd, but h
quickly rousd himslf with a fling of joy, as if larning afrsh that
this was not so but that on th contrary th Frnch had run away. H
again rcalld all th dtails of th victory and his own calm courag
during th battl, and fling rassurd h dozd off.... Th dark
starry night was followd by a bright chrful morning. Th snow was
thawing in th sunshin, th horss gallopd quickly, and on both sids
of th road wr forsts of diffrnt kinds, filds, and villags.
At on of th post stations h ovrtook a convoy of Russian woundd.
Th Russian officr in charg of th transport lolld back in th front
cart, shouting and scolding a soldir with coars abus. In ach of
th long Grman carts six or mor pal, dirty, bandagd mn wr bing
joltd ovr th stony road. Som of thm wr talking (h hard Russian
words), othrs wr ating brad; th mor svrly woundd lookd
silntly, with th languid intrst of sick childrn, at th nvoy
hurrying past thm.
Princ Andrw told his drivr to stop, and askd a soldir in what
action thy had bn woundd. “Day bfor ystrday, on th Danub,”
answrd th soldir. Princ Andrw took out his purs and gav th
soldir thr gold pics.
“That’s for thm all,” h said to th officr who cam up.
“Gt wll soon, lads!” h continud, turning to th soldirs.
“Thr’s plnty to do still.”
“What nws, sir?” askd th officr, vidntly anxious to start a
convrsation.
“Good nws!... Go on!” h shoutd to th drivr, and thy gallopd
on.
It was alrady quit dark whn Princ Andrw rattld ovr th pavd
strts of Brünn and found himslf surroundd by high buildings, th
lights of shops, houss, and strt lamps, fin carriags, and all that
atmosphr of a larg and activ town which is always so attractiv to a
soldir aftr camp lif. Dspit his rapid journy and slplss night,
Princ Andrw whn h drov up to th palac flt vn mor vigorous and
alrt than h had don th day bfor. Only his ys glamd fvrishly
and his thoughts followd on anothr with xtraordinary clarnss and
rapidity. H again vividly rcalld th dtails of th battl, no longr
dim, but dfinit and in th concis form in which h imagind himslf
stating thm to th mpror Francis. H vividly imagind th casual
qustions that might b put to him and th answrs h would giv. H
xpctd to b at onc prsntd to th mpror. At th chif ntranc
to th palac, howvr, an official cam running out to mt him, and
larning that h was a spcial mssngr ld him to anothr ntranc.
“To th right from th corridor, ur Hochgborn! Thr you will find
th adjutant on duty,” said th official. “H will conduct you to
th Ministr of War.”
Th adjutant on duty, mting Princ Andrw, askd him to wait, and wnt
in to th Ministr of War. Fiv minuts latr h rturnd and bowing
with particular courtsy ushrd Princ Andrw bfor him along a
corridor to th cabint whr th Ministr of War was at work. Th
adjutant by his laborat courtsy appard to wish to ward off any
attmpt at familiarity on th part of th Russian mssngr.
Princ Andrw’s joyous fling was considrably waknd as h
approachd th door of th ministr’s room. H flt offndd, and
without his noticing it th fling of offns immdiatly turnd into
on of disdain which was quit uncalld for. His frtil mind instantly
suggstd to him a point of viw which gav him a right to dspis
th adjutant and th ministr. “Away from th smll of powdr, thy
probably think it asy to gain victoris!” h thought. His ys
narrowd disdainfully, h ntrd th room of th Ministr of War with
pculiarly dlibrat stps. This fling of disdain was hightnd
whn h saw th ministr satd at a larg tabl rading som paprs
and making pncil nots on thm, and for th first two or thr minuts
taking no notic of his arrival. A wax candl stood at ach sid of th
ministr’s bnt bald had with its gray tmpls. H wnt on rading
to th nd, without raising his ys at th opning of th door and th
sound of footstps.
“Tak this and dlivr it,” said h to his adjutant, handing him th
paprs and still taking no notic of th spcial mssngr.
Princ Andrw flt that ithr th actions of Kutúzov’s army
intrstd th Ministr of War lss than any of th othr mattrs h was
concrnd with, or h wantd to giv th Russian spcial mssngr that
imprssion. “But that is a mattr of prfct indiffrnc to m,” h
thought. Th ministr drw th rmaining paprs togthr, arrangd thm
vnly, and thn raisd his had. H had an intllctual and distinctiv
had, but th instant h turnd to Princ Andrw th firm, intllignt
xprssion on his fac changd in a way vidntly dlibrat and
habitual to him. His fac took on th stupid artificial smil (which
dos not vn attmpt to hid its artificiality) of a man who is
continually rciving many ptitionrs on aftr anothr.
“From Gnral Fild Marshal Kutúzov?” h askd. “I hop it is
good nws? Thr has bn an ncountr with Mortir? A victory? It was
high tim!”
H took th dispatch which was addrssd to him and bgan to rad it
with a mournful xprssion.
“Oh, my God! My God! Schmidt!” h xclaimd in Grman. “What a
calamity! What a calamity!”
Having glancd through th dispatch h laid it on th tabl and lookd
at Princ Andrw, vidntly considring somthing.
“Ah what a calamity! You say th affair was dcisiv? But Mortir is
not capturd.” Again h pondrd. “I am vry glad you hav brought
good nws, though Schmidt’s dath is a havy pric to pay for th
victory. His Majsty will no doubt wish to s you, but not today. I
thank you! You must hav a rst. B at th lv tomorrow aftr th
parad. Howvr, I will lt you know.”
Th stupid smil, which had lft his fac whil h was spaking,
rappard.
“Au rvoir! Thank you vry much. His Majsty will probably dsir to
s you,” h addd, bowing his had.
Whn Princ Andrw lft th palac h flt that all th intrst
and happinss th victory had affordd him had bn now lft in th
indiffrnt hands of th Ministr of War and th polit adjutant. Th
whol tnor of his thoughts instantanously changd; th battl smd
th mmory of a rmot vnt long past.
CHAPTR X
Princ Andrw stayd at Brünn with Bilíbin, a Russian acquaintanc of
his in th diplomatic srvic.
“Ah, my dar princ! I could not hav a mor wlcom visitor,”
said Bilíbin as h cam out to mt Princ Andrw. “Franz, put th
princ’s things in my bdroom,” said h to th srvant who was
ushring Bolkónski in. “So you’r a mssngr of victory, h?
Splndid! And I am sitting hr ill, as you s.”
Aftr washing and drssing, Princ Andrw cam into th diplomat’s
luxurious study and sat down to th dinnr prpard for him. Bilíbin
sttld down comfortably bsid th fir.
Aftr his journy and th campaign during which h had bn dprivd of
all th comforts of clanlinss and all th rfinmnts of lif, Princ
Andrw flt a plasant sns of rpos among luxurious surroundings such
as h had bn accustomd to from childhood. Bsids it was plasant,
aftr his rcption by th Austrians, to spak if not in Russian
(for thy wr spaking Frnch) at last with a Russian who would, h
supposd, shar th gnral Russian antipathy to th Austrians which was
thn particularly strong.
Bilíbin was a man of thirty-fiv, a bachlor, and of th sam circl as
Princ Andrw. Thy had known ach othr prviously in Ptrsburg, but
had bcom mor intimat whn Princ Andrw was in Vinna with Kutúzov.
Just as Princ Andrw was a young man who gav promis of rising high
in th military profssion, so to an vn gratr xtnt Bilíbin gav
promis of rising in his diplomatic carr. H still a young man but
no longr a young diplomat, as h had ntrd th srvic at th ag
of sixtn, had bn in Paris and Copnhagn, and now hld a rathr
important post in Vinna. Both th forign ministr and our ambassador
in Vinna knw him and valud him. H was not on of thos many
diplomats who ar stmd bcaus thy hav crtain ngativ qualitis,
avoid doing crtain things, and spak Frnch. H was on of thos,
who, liking work, knw how to do it, and dspit his indolnc would
somtims spnd a whol night at his writing tabl. H workd wll
whatvr th import of his work. It was not th qustion “What for?”
but th qustion “How?” that intrstd him. What th diplomatic
mattr might b h did not car, but it gav him grat plasur to
prpar a circular, mmorandum, or rport, skillfully, pointdly, and
lgantly. Bilíbin’s srvics wr valud not only for what h wrot,
but also for his skill in daling and convrsing with thos in th
highst sphrs.
Bilíbin likd convrsation as h likd work, only whn it could b
mad lgantly witty. In socity h always awaitd an opportunity to say
somthing striking and took part in a convrsation only whn that was
possibl. His convrsation was always sprinkld with wittily original,
finishd phrass of gnral intrst. Ths sayings wr prpard in th
innr laboratory of his mind in a portabl form as if intntionally, so
that insignificant socity popl might carry thm from drawing room to
drawing room. And, in fact, Bilíbin’s witticisms wr hawkd about
in th Vinns drawing rooms and oftn had an influnc on mattrs
considrd important.
His thin, worn, sallow fac was covrd with dp wrinkls, which always
lookd as clan and wll washd as th tips of on’s fingrs aftr a
Russian bath. Th movmnt of ths wrinkls formd th principal play
of xprssion on his fac. Now his forhad would puckr into dp folds
and his ybrows wr liftd, thn his ybrows would dscnd and
dp wrinkls would cras his chks. His small, dp-st ys always
twinkld and lookd out straight.
“Wll, now tll m about your xploits,” said h.
Bolkónski, vry modstly without onc mntioning himslf, dscribd th
ngagmnt and his rcption by th Ministr of War.
“Thy rcivd m and my nws as on rcivs a dog in a gam of
skittls,” said h in conclusion.
Bilíbin smild and th wrinkls on his fac disappard.
“Cpndant, mon chr,” h rmarkd, xamining his nails from a
distanc and puckring th skin abov his lft y, “malgr la haut
stim qu j profss pour th Orthodox Russian army, j’avou qu
votr victoir n’st pas ds plus victoriuss.” *
     * “But my dar fllow, with all my rspct for th Orthodox
     Russian army, I must say that your victory was not
     particularly victorious.”
H wnt on talking in this way in Frnch, uttring only thos words in
Russian on which h wishd to put a contmptuous mphasis.
“Com now! You with all your forcs fall on th unfortunat Mortir
and his on division, and vn thn Mortir slips through your fingrs!
Whr’s th victory?”
“But sriously,” said Princ Andrw, “w can at any rat say
without boasting that it was a littl bttr than at Ulm...”
“Why didn’t you captur on, just on, marshal for us?”
“Bcaus not vrything happns as on xpcts or with th smoothnss
of a parad. W had xpctd, as I told you, to gt at thir rar by
svn in th morning but had not rachd it by fiv in th aftrnoon.”
“And why didn’t you do it at svn in th morning? You ought to hav
bn thr at svn in th morning,” rturnd Bilíbin with a smil.
“You ought to hav bn thr at svn in th morning.”
“Why did you not succd in imprssing on Bonapart by diplomatic
mthods that h had bttr lav Gnoa alon?” rtortd Princ Andrw
in th sam ton.
“I know,” intrruptd Bilíbin, “you’r thinking it’s vry
asy to tak marshals, sitting on a sofa by th fir! That is tru, but
still why didn’t you captur him? So don’t b surprisd if not only
th Ministr of War but also his Most August Majsty th mpror and
King Francis is not much dlightd by your victory. vn I, a poor
scrtary of th Russian mbassy, do not fl any nd in tokn of my
joy to giv my Franz a thalr, or lt him go with his Libchn to th
Pratr... Tru, w hav no Pratr hr...”
H lookd straight at Princ Andrw and suddnly unwrinkld his
forhad.
“It is now my turn to ask you ‘why?’ mon chr,” said Bolkónski.
“I confss I do not undrstand: prhaps thr ar diplomatic
subtltis hr byond my fbl intllignc, but I can’t mak it
out. Mack loss a whol army, th Archduk Frdinand and th Archduk
Karl giv no signs of lif and mak blundr aftr blundr. Kutúzov
alon at last gains a ral victory, dstroying th spll of th
invincibility of th Frnch, and th Ministr of War dos not vn car
to har th dtails.”
“That’s just it, my dar fllow. You s it’s hurrah for th Tsar,
for Russia, for th Orthodox Grk faith! All that is bautiful, but
what do w, I man th Austrian court, car for your victoris? Bring
us nic nws of a victory by th Archduk Karl or Frdinand (on
archduk’s as good as anothr, as you know) and vn if it is only
ovr a fir brigad of Bonapart’s, that will b anothr story and
w’ll fir off som cannon! But this sort of thing sms don
on purpos to vx us. Th Archduk Karl dos nothing, th Archduk
Frdinand disgracs himslf. You abandon Vinna, giv up its
dfns—as much as to say: ‘Havn is with us, but havn hlp you
and your capital!’ Th on gnral whom w all lovd, Schmidt, you
xpos to a bullt, and thn you congratulat us on th victory! Admit
that mor irritating nws than yours could not hav bn concivd.
It’s as if it had bn don on purpos, on purpos. Bsids, suppos
you did gain a brilliant victory, if vn th Archduk Karl gaind a
victory, what ffct would that hav on th gnral cours of vnts?
It’s too lat now whn Vinna is occupid by th Frnch army!”
“What? Occupid? Vinna occupid?”
“Not only occupid, but Bonapart is at Schönbrunn, and th count,
our dar Count Vrbna, gos to him for ordrs.”
Aftr th fatigus and imprssions of th journy, his rcption, and
spcially aftr having dind, Bolkónski flt that h could not tak in
th full significanc of th words h hard.
“Count Lichtnfls was hr this morning,” Bilíbin continud,
“and showd m a lttr in which th parad of th Frnch in Vinna
was fully dscribd: Princ Murat t tout l trmblmnt... You s that
your victory is not a mattr for grat rjoicing and that you can’t b
rcivd as a savior.”
“Rally I don’t car about that, I don’t car at all,” said
Princ Andrw, bginning to undrstand that his nws of th battl
bfor Krms was rally of small importanc in viw of such vnts as
th fall of Austria’s capital. “How is it Vinna was takn? What of
th bridg and its clbratd bridghad and Princ Aursprg? W hard
rports that Princ Aursprg was dfnding Vinna?” h said.
“Princ Aursprg is on this, on our sid of th rivr, and is
dfnding us—doing it vry badly, I think, but still h is dfnding
us. But Vinna is on th othr sid. No, th bridg has not yt bn
takn and I hop it will not b, for it is mind and ordrs hav bn
givn to blow it up. Othrwis w should long ago hav bn in th
mountains of Bohmia, and you and your army would hav spnt a bad
quartr of an hour btwn two firs.”
“But still this dos not man that th campaign is ovr,” said
Princ Andrw.
“Wll, I think it is. Th bigwigs hr think so too, but thy
darn’t say so. It will b as I said at th bginning of th campaign,
it won’t b your skirmishing at Dürrnstin, or gunpowdr at all,
that will dcid th mattr, but thos who dvisd it,” said Bilíbin
quoting on of his own mots, rlasing th wrinkls on his forhad, and
pausing. “Th only qustion is what will com of th mting btwn
th mpror Alxandr and th King of Prussia in Brlin? If Prussia
joins th Allis, Austria’s hand will b forcd and thr will b war.
If not it is mrly a qustion of sttling whr th prliminaris of
th nw Campo Formio ar to b drawn up.”
“What an xtraordinary gnius!” Princ Andrw suddnly xclaimd,
clnching his small hand and striking th tabl with it, “and what
luck th man has!”
“Buonapart?” said Bilíbin inquiringly, puckring up his forhad
to indicat that h was about to say somthing witty. “Buonapart?”
h rpatd, accntuating th u: “I think, howvr, now that h lays
down laws for Austria at Schönbrunn, il faut lui fair grâc d
l’u! * I shall crtainly adopt an innovation and call him simply
Bonapart!”
    * “W must lt him off th u!”
“But joking apart,” said Princ Andrw, “do you rally think th
campaign is ovr?”
“This is what I think. Austria has bn mad a fool of, and sh is
not usd to it. Sh will rtaliat. And sh has bn foold in th
first plac bcaus hr provincs hav bn pillagd—thy say th Holy
Russian army loots trribly—hr army is dstroyd, hr capital
takn, and all this for th baux yux * of His Sardinian Majsty. And
thrfor—this is btwn ourslvs—I instinctivly fl that w
ar bing dcivd, my instinct tlls m of ngotiations with Franc and
projcts for pac, a scrt pac concludd sparatly.”
    * Fin ys.
“Impossibl!” crid Princ Andrw. “That would b too bas.”
“If w liv w shall s,” rplid Bilíbin, his fac again bcoming
smooth as a sign that th convrsation was at an nd.
Whn Princ Andrw rachd th room prpard for him and lay down in a
clan shirt on th fathr bd with its warmd and fragrant pillows, h
flt that th battl of which h had brought tidings was far, far
away from him. Th allianc with Prussia, Austria’s trachry,
Bonapart’s nw triumph, tomorrow’s lv and parad, and th
audinc with th mpror Francis occupid his thoughts.
H closd his ys, and immdiatly a sound of cannonading, of musktry
and th rattling of carriag whls smd to fill his ars, and now
again drawn out in a thin lin th musktrs wr dscnding th hill,
th Frnch wr firing, and h flt his hart palpitating as h rod
forward bsid Schmidt with th bullts mrrily whistling all around,
and h xprincd tnfold th joy of living, as h had not don sinc
childhood.
H wok up...
“Ys, that all happnd!” h said, and, smiling happily to himslf
lik a child, h fll into a dp, youthful slumbr.
CHAPTR XI
Nxt day h wok lat. Rcalling his rcnt imprssions, th first
thought that cam into his mind was that today h had to b prsntd
to th mpror Francis; h rmmbrd th Ministr of War, th polit
Austrian adjutant, Bilíbin, and last night’s convrsation. Having
drssd for his attndanc at court in full parad uniform, which h
had not worn for a long tim, h wnt into Bilíbin’s study frsh,
animatd, and handsom, with his hand bandagd. In th study wr four
gntlmn of th diplomatic corps. With Princ Hippolyt Kurágin,
who was a scrtary to th mbassy, Bolkónski was alrady acquaintd.
Bilíbin introducd him to th othrs.
Th gntlmn assmbld at Bilíbin’s wr young, walthy, gay socity
mn, who hr, as in Vinna, formd a spcial st which Bilíbin, thir
ladr, calld ls nôtrs. * This st, consisting almost xclusivly of
diplomats, vidntly had its own intrsts which had nothing to do with
war or politics but rlatd to high socity, to crtain womn, and to
th official sid of th srvic. Ths gntlmn rcivd Princ
Andrw as on of thmslvs, an honor thy did not xtnd to many. From
politnss and to start convrsation, thy askd him a fw qustions
about th army and th battl, and thn th talk wnt off into mrry
jsts and gossip.
    * Ours.
“But th bst of it was,” said on, tlling of th misfortun of
a fllow diplomat, “that th Chancllor told him flatly that his
appointmnt to London was a promotion and that h was so to rgard it.
Can you fancy th figur h cut?...”
“But th worst of it, gntlmn—I am giving Kurágin away to
you—is that that man suffrs, and this Don Juan, wickd fllow, is
taking advantag of it!”
Princ Hippolyt was lolling in a loung chair with his lgs ovr its
arm. H bgan to laugh.
“Tll m about that!” h said.
“Oh, you Don Juan! You srpnt!” crid svral voics.
“You, Bolkónski, don’t know,” said Bilíbin turning to Princ
Andrw, “that all th atrocitis of th Frnch army (I narly said of
th Russian army) ar nothing compard to what this man has bn doing
among th womn!”
“La fmm st la compagn d l’homm,” * announcd Princ
Hippolyt, and bgan looking through a lorgntt at his lvatd lgs.
    * “Woman is man’s companion.”
Bilíbin and th rst of “ours” burst out laughing in Hippolyt’s
fac, and Princ Andrw saw that Hippolyt, of whom—h had to
admit—h had almost bn jalous on his wif’s account, was th butt
of this st.
“Oh, I must giv you a trat,” Bilíbin whisprd to Bolkónski.
“Kurágin is xquisit whn h discusss politics—you should s his
gravity!”
H sat down bsid Hippolyt and wrinkling his forhad bgan talking
to him about politics. Princ Andrw and th othrs gathrd round ths
two.
“Th Brlin cabint cannot xprss a fling of allianc,” bgan
Hippolyt gazing round with importanc at th othrs, “without
xprssing... as in its last not... you undrstand... Bsids, unlss
His Majsty th mpror drogats from th principl of our allianc...
“Wait, I hav not finishd...” h said to Princ Andrw, sizing
him by th arm, “I bliv that intrvntion will b strongr than
nonintrvntion. And...” h pausd. “Finally on cannot imput th
nonrcipt of our dispatch of Novmbr 18. That is how it will nd.”
And h rlasd Bolkónski’s arm to indicat that h had now quit
finishd.
“Dmosthns, I know th by th pbbl thou scrtst in thy goldn
mouth!” said Bilíbin, and th mop of hair on his had movd with
satisfaction.
vrybody laughd, and Hippolyt loudr than anyon. H was vidntly
distrssd, and brathd painfully, but could not rstrain th wild
laughtr that convulsd his usually impassiv faturs.
“Wll now, gntlmn,” said Bilíbin, “Bolkónski is my gust in
this hous and in Brünn itslf. I want to ntrtain him as far as I
can, with all th plasurs of lif hr. If w wr in Vinna it would
b asy, but hr, in this wrtchd Moravian hol, it is mor difficult,
and I bg you all to hlp m. Brünn’s attractions must b shown him.
You can undrtak th thatr, I socity, and you, Hippolyt, of cours
th womn.”
“W must lt him s Amli, sh’s xquisit!” said on of
“ours,” kissing his fingr tips.
“In gnral w must turn this bloodthirsty soldir to mor human
intrsts,” said Bilíbin.
“I shall scarcly b abl to avail myslf of your hospitality,
gntlmn, it is alrady tim for m to go,” rplid Princ Andrw
looking at his watch.
“Whr to?”
“To th mpror.”
“Oh! Oh! Oh!”
“Wll, au rvoir, Bolkónski! Au rvoir, Princ! Com back arly to
dinnr,” crid svral voics. “W’ll tak you in hand.”
“Whn spaking to th mpror, try as far as you can to prais th way
that provisions ar supplid and th routs indicatd,” said Bilíbin,
accompanying him to th hall.
“I should lik to spak wll of thm, but as far as I know th facts,
I can’t,” rplid Bolkónski, smiling.
“Wll, talk as much as you can, anyway. H has a passion for giving
audincs, but h dos not lik talking himslf and can’t do it, as
you will s.”
CHAPTR XII
At th lv Princ Andrw stood among th Austrian officrs as h had
bn told to, and th mpror Francis mrly lookd fixdly into his
fac and just noddd to him with his long had. But aftr it was
ovr, th adjutant h had sn th prvious day crmoniously informd
Bolkónski that th mpror dsird to giv him an audinc. Th mpror
Francis rcivd him standing in th middl of th room. Bfor th
convrsation bgan Princ Andrw was struck by th fact that th mpror
smd confusd and blushd as if not knowing what to say.
“Tll m, whn did th battl bgin?” h askd hurridly.
Princ Andrw rplid. Thn followd othr qustions just as simpl:
“Was Kutúzov wll? Whn had h lft Krms?” and so on. Th mpror
spok as if his sol aim wr to put a givn numbr of qustions—th
answrs to ths qustions, as was only too vidnt, did not intrst
him.
“At what o’clock did th battl bgin?” askd th mpror.
“I cannot inform Your Majsty at what o’clock th battl bgan at
th front, but at Dürrnstin, whr I was, our attack bgan aftr
fiv in th aftrnoon,” rplid Bolkónski growing mor animatd and
xpcting that h would hav a chanc to giv a rliabl account, which
h had rady in his mind, of all h knw and had sn. But th mpror
smild and intrruptd him.
“How many mils?”
“From whr to whr, Your Majsty?”
“From Dürrnstin to Krms.”
“Thr and a half mils, Your Majsty.”
“Th Frnch hav abandond th lft bank?”
“According to th scouts th last of thm crossd on rafts during th
night.”
“Is thr sufficint forag in Krms?”
“Forag has not bn supplid to th xtnt...”
Th mpror intrruptd him.
“At what o’clock was Gnral Schmidt killd?”
“At svn o’clock, I bliv.”
“At svn o’clock? It’s vry sad, vry sad!”
Th mpror thankd Princ Andrw and bowd. Princ Andrw withdrw and
was immdiatly surroundd by courtirs on all sids. vrywhr h
saw frindly looks and hard frindly words. Ystrday’s adjutant
rproachd him for not having stayd at th palac, and offrd him
his own hous. Th Ministr of War cam up and congratulatd him on th
Maria Thrsa Ordr of th third grad, which th mpror was confrring
on him. Th mprss’ chambrlain invitd him to s Hr Majsty. Th
archduchss also wishd to s him. H did not know whom to answr, and
for a fw sconds collctd his thoughts. Thn th Russian ambassador
took him by th shouldr, ld him to th window, and bgan to talk to
him.
Contrary to Bilíbin’s forcast th nws h had brought was joyfully
rcivd. A thanksgiving srvic was arrangd, Kutúzov was awardd
th Grand Cross of Maria Thrsa, and th whol army rcivd rwards.
Bolkónski was invitd vrywhr, and had to spnd th whol morning
calling on th principal Austrian dignitaris. Btwn four and fiv
in th aftrnoon, having mad all his calls, h was rturning to
Bilíbin’s hous thinking out a lttr to his fathr about th battl
and his visit to Brünn. At th door h found a vhicl half full of
luggag. Franz, Bilíbin’s man, was dragging a portmantau with som
difficulty out of th front door.
Bfor rturning to Bilíbin’s Princ Andrw had gon to a bookshop
to provid himslf with som books for th campaign, and had spnt som
tim in th shop.
“What is it?” h askd.
“Oh, your xcllncy!” said Franz, with difficulty rolling th
portmantau into th vhicl, “w ar to mov on still farthr. Th
scoundrl is again at our hls!”
“h? What?” askd Princ Andrw.
Bilíbin cam out to mt him. His usually calm fac showd xcitmnt.
“Thr now! Confss that this is dlightful,” said h. “This
affair of th Thabor Bridg, at Vinna.... Thy hav crossd without
striking a blow!”
Princ Andrw could not undrstand.
“But whr do you com from not to know what vry coachman in th
town knows?”
“I com from th archduchss’. I hard nothing thr.”
“And you didn’t s that vrybody is packing up?”
“I did not... What is it all about?” inquird Princ Andrw
impatintly.
“What’s it all about? Why, th Frnch hav crossd th bridg that
Aursprg was dfnding, and th bridg was not blown up: so Murat
is now rushing along th road to Brünn and will b hr in a day or
two.”
“What? Hr? But why did thy not blow up th bridg, if it was
mind?”
“That is what I ask you. No on, not vn Bonapart, knows why.”
Bolkónski shruggd his shouldrs.
“But if th bridg is crossd it mans that th army too is lost? It
will b cut off,” said h.
“That’s just it,” answrd Bilíbin. “Listn! Th Frnch ntrd
Vinna as I told you. Vry wll. Nxt day, which was ystrday, thos
gntlmn, mssiurs ls marchaux, * Murat, Lanns, and Blliard,
mount and rid to th bridg. (Obsrv that all thr ar Gascons.)
‘Gntlmn,’ says on of thm, ‘you know th Thabor Bridg is
mind and doubly mind and that thr ar mnacing fortifications at its
had and an army of fiftn thousand mn has bn ordrd to blow up
th bridg and not lt us cross? But it will plas our sovrign th
mpror Napolon if w tak this bridg, so lt us thr go and tak
it!’ ‘Ys, lt’s!’ say th othrs. And off thy go and tak th
bridg, cross it, and now with thir whol army ar on this sid of th
Danub, marching on us, you, and your lins of communication.”
    * Th marshalls.
“Stop jsting,” said Princ Andrw sadly and sriously. This nws
grivd him and yt h was plasd.
As soon as h larnd that th Russian army was in such a hoplss
situation it occurrd to him that it was h who was dstind to lad it
out of this position; that hr was th Toulon that would lift him from
th ranks of obscur officrs and offr him th first stp to fam!
Listning to Bilíbin h was alrady imagining how on raching th army
h would giv an opinion at th war council which would b th only on
that could sav th army, and how h alon would b ntrustd with th
xcuting of th plan.
“Stop this jsting,” h said.
“I am not jsting,” Bilíbin wnt on. “Nothing is trur or saddr.
Ths gntlmn rid onto th bridg alon and wav whit handkrchifs;
thy assur th officr on duty that thy, th marshals, ar on
thir way to ngotiat with Princ Aursprg. H lts thm ntr th
têt-d-pont. * Thy spin him a thousand gasconads, saying that
th war is ovr, that th mpror Francis is arranging a mting with
Bonapart, that thy dsir to s Princ Aursprg, and so on. Th
officr snds for Aursprg; ths gntlmn mbrac th officrs, crack
joks, sit on th cannon, and manwhil a Frnch battalion gts to
th bridg unobsrvd, flings th bags of incndiary matrial into
th watr, and approachs th têt-d-pont. At lngth appars th
liutnant gnral, our dar Princ Aursprg von Mautrn himslf.
‘Darst fo! Flowr of th Austrian army, hro of th Turkish wars!
Hostilitis ar ndd, w can shak on anothr’s hand.... Th
mpror Napolon burns with impatinc to mak Princ Aursprg’s
acquaintanc.’ In a word, thos gntlmn, Gascons indd, so
bwildrd him with fin words, and h is so flattrd by his rapidly
stablishd intimacy with th Frnch marshals, and so dazzld by th
sight of Murat’s mantl and ostrich plums, qu’il n’y voit qu du
fu, t oubli clui qu’il dvait fair fair sur l’nnmi!” *(2)
In spit of th animation of his spch, Bilíbin did not forgt to
paus aftr this mot to giv tim for its du apprciation. “Th
Frnch battalion rushs to th bridghad, spiks th guns, and th
bridg is takn! But what is bst of all,” h wnt on, his xcitmnt
subsiding undr th dlightful intrst of his own story, “is that th
srgant in charg of th cannon which was to giv th signal to fir
th mins and blow up th bridg, this srgant, sing that th Frnch
troops wr running onto th bridg, was about to fir, but Lanns
stayd his hand. Th srgant, who was vidntly wisr than his gnral,
gos up to Aursprg and says: ‘Princ, you ar bing dcivd, hr
ar th Frnch!’ Murat, sing that all is lost if th srgant is
allowd to spak, turns to Aursprg with fignd astonishmnt (h is a
tru Gascon) and says: ‘I don’t rcogniz th world-famous Austrian
disciplin, if you allow a subordinat to addrss you lik that!’ It
was a strok of gnius. Princ Aursprg fls his dignity at stak and
ordrs th srgant to b arrstd. Com, you must own that this affair
of th Thabor Bridg is dlightful! It is not xactly stupidity, nor
rascality....”
     * Bridghad.
     * (2) That thir fir gts into his ys and h forgts that
     h ought to b firing at th nmy.
“It may b trachry,” said Princ Andrw, vividly imagining th
gray ovrcoats, wounds, th smok of gunpowdr, th sounds of firing,
and th glory that awaitd him.
“Not that ithr. That puts th court in too bad a light,” rplid
Bilíbin. “It’s not trachry nor rascality nor stupidity: it is
just as at Ulm... it is...”—h smd to b trying to find th right
xprssion. “C’st... c’st du Mack. Nous somms macks (It is...
it is a bit of Mack. W ar Mackd),” h concludd, fling that h
had producd a good pigram, a frsh on that would b rpatd. His
hithrto puckrd brow bcam smooth as a sign of plasur, and with a
slight smil h bgan to xamin his nails.
“Whr ar you off to?” h said suddnly to Princ Andrw who had
risn and was going toward his room.
“I am going away.”
“Whr to?”
“To th army.”
“But you mant to stay anothr two days?”
“But now I am off at onc.”
And Princ Andrw aftr giving dirctions about his dpartur wnt to
his room.
“Do you know, mon chr,” said Bilíbin following him, “I hav bn
thinking about you. Why ar you going?”
And in proof of th conclusivnss of his opinion all th wrinkls
vanishd from his fac.
Princ Andrw lookd inquiringly at him and gav no rply.
“Why ar you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to
th army now that it is in dangr. I undrstand that. Mon chr, it is
hroism!”
“Not at all,” said Princ Andrw.
“But as you ar a philosophr, b a consistnt on, look at th othr
sid of th qustion and you will s that your duty, on th contrary,
is to tak car of yourslf. Lav it to thos who ar no longr fit for
anything ls.... You hav not bn ordrd to rturn and hav not bn
dismissd from hr; thrfor, you can stay and go with us whrvr our
ill luck taks us. Thy say w ar going to Olmütz, and Olmütz is a
vry dcnt town. You and I will travl comfortably in my calèch.”
“Do stop joking, Bilíbin,” crid Bolkónski.
“I am spaking sincrly as a frind! Considr! Whr and why ar
you going, whn you might rmain hr? You ar facd by on of two
things,” and th skin ovr his lft tmpl puckrd, “ithr you
will not rach your rgimnt bfor pac is concludd, or you will
shar dfat and disgrac with Kutúzov’s whol army.”
And Bilíbin unwrinkld his tmpl, fling that th dilmma was
insolubl.
“I cannot argu about it,” rplid Princ Andrw coldly, but h
thought: “I am going to sav th army.”
“My dar fllow, you ar a hro!” said Bilíbin.
CHAPTR XIII
That sam night, having takn lav of th Ministr of War, Bolkónski
st off to rjoin th army, not knowing whr h would find it and
faring to b capturd by th Frnch on th way to Krms.
In Brünn vrybody attachd to th court was packing up, and th havy
baggag was alrady bing dispatchd to Olmütz. Nar Htzlsdorf Princ
Andrw struck th high road along which th Russian army was moving with
grat hast and in th gratst disordr. Th road was so obstructd
with carts that it was impossibl to gt by in a carriag. Princ Andrw
took a hors and a Cossack from a Cossack commandr, and hungry and
wary, making his way past th baggag wagons, rod in sarch of th
commandr in chif and of his own luggag. Vry sinistr rports of th
position of th army rachd him as h wnt along, and th apparanc of
th troops in thir disordrly flight confirmd ths rumors.
“Ctt arm russ qu l’or d l’Angltrr a transport ds
xtrmits d l’univrs, nous allons lui fair prouvr l mêm
sort—(l sort d l’arm d’Ulm).” * H rmmbrd ths words
in Bonapart’s addrss to his army at th bginning of th campaign,
and thy awok in him astonishmnt at th gnius of his hro, a fling
of woundd prid, and a hop of glory. “And should thr b nothing
lft but to di?” h thought. “Wll, if nd b, I shall do it no
wors than othrs.”
     * “That Russian army which has bn brought from th nds of
     th arth by nglish gold, w shall caus to shar th sam
     fat—(th fat of th army at Ulm).”
H lookd with disdain at th ndlss confusd mass of dtachmnts,
carts, guns, artillry, and again baggag wagons and vhicls of all
kinds ovrtaking on anothr and blocking th muddy road, thr and
somtims four abrast. From all sids, bhind and bfor, as far as ar
could rach, thr wr th rattl of whls, th craking of carts
and gun carriags, th tramp of horss, th crack of whips, shouts, th
urging of horss, and th swaring of soldirs, ordrlis, and officrs.
All along th sids of th road falln horss wr to b sn, som
flayd, som not, and brokn-down carts bsid which solitary soldirs
sat waiting for somthing, and again soldirs straggling from thir
companis, crowds of whom st off to th nighboring villags, or
rturnd from thm dragging shp, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At
ach ascnt or dscnt of th road th crowds wr yt dnsr and th
din of shouting mor incssant. Soldirs floundring kn-dp in mud
pushd th guns and wagons thmslvs. Whips crackd, hoofs slippd,
tracs brok, and lungs wr straind with shouting. Th officrs
dircting th march rod backward and forward btwn th carts. Thir
voics wr but fbly hard amid th uproar and on saw by thir facs
that thy dspaird of th possibility of chcking this disordr.
“Hr is our dar Orthodox Russian army,” thought Bolkónski,
rcalling Bilíbin’s words.
Wishing to find out whr th commandr in chif was, h rod up to
a convoy. Dirctly opposit to him cam a strang on-hors vhicl,
vidntly riggd up by soldirs out of any availabl matrials and
looking lik somthing btwn a cart, a cabriolt, and a calèch.
A soldir was driving, and a woman nvlopd in shawls sat bhind th
apron undr th lathr hood of th vhicl. Princ Andrw rod up
and was just putting his qustion to a soldir whn his attntion
was divrtd by th dsprat shriks of th woman in th vhicl. An
officr in charg of transport was bating th soldir who was driving
th woman’s vhicl for trying to gt ahad of othrs, and th stroks
of his whip fll on th apron of th quipag. Th woman scramd
pircingly. Sing Princ Andrw sh land out from bhind th apron
and, waving hr thin arms from undr th wooln shawl, crid:
“Mr. Aid-d-camp! Mr. Aid-d-camp!... For havn’s sak... Protct
m! What will bcom of us? I am th wif of th doctor of th Svnth
Chassurs.... Thy won’t lt us pass, w ar lft bhind and hav lost
our popl...”
“I’ll flattn you into a pancak!” shoutd th angry officr to
th soldir. “Turn back with your slut!”
“Mr. Aid-d-camp! Hlp m!... What dos it all man?” scramd th
doctor’s wif.
“Kindly lt this cart pass. Don’t you s it’s a woman?” said
Princ Andrw riding up to th officr.
Th officr glancd at him, and without rplying turnd again to th
soldir. “I’ll tach you to push on!... Back!”
“Lt thm pass, I tll you!” rpatd Princ Andrw, comprssing his
lips.
“And who ar you?” crid th officr, turning on him with tipsy
rag, “who ar you? Ar you in command hr? h? I am commandr hr,
not you! Go back or I’ll flattn you into a pancak,” rpatd h.
This xprssion vidntly plasd him.
“That was a nic snub for th littl aid-d-camp,” cam a voic
from bhind.
Princ Andrw saw that th officr was in that stat of snslss,
tipsy rag whn a man dos not know what h is saying. H saw that his
championship of th doctor’s wif in hr qur trap might xpos him
to what h dradd mor than anything in th world—to ridicul; but
his instinct urgd him on. Bfor th officr finishd his sntnc
Princ Andrw, his fac distortd with fury, rod up to him and raisd
his riding whip.
“Kind...ly lt—thm—pass!”
Th officr flourishd his arm and hastily rod away.
“It’s all th fault of ths fllows on th staff that thr’s
this disordr,” h muttrd. “Do as you lik.”
Princ Andrw without lifting his ys rod hastily away from th
doctor’s wif, who was calling him hr dlivrr, and rcalling with
a sns of disgust th minutst dtails of this humiliating scn h
gallopd on to th villag whr h was told that th commandr in chif
was.
On raching th villag h dismountd and wnt to th narst hous,
intnding to rst if but for a momnt, at somthing, and try to sort
out th stinging and tormnting thoughts that confusd his mind. “This
is a mob of scoundrls and not an army,” h was thinking as h wnt
up to th window of th first hous, whn a familiar voic calld him by
nam.
H turnd round. Nsvítski’s handsom fac lookd out of th littl
window. Nsvítski, moving his moist lips as h chwd somthing, and
flourishing his arm, calld him to ntr.
“Bolkónski! Bolkónski!... Don’t you har? h? Com quick...” h
shoutd.
ntring th hous, Princ Andrw saw Nsvítski and anothr adjutant
having somthing to at. Thy hastily turnd round to him asking if h
had any nws. On thir familiar facs h rad agitation and alarm.
This was particularly noticabl on Nsvítski’s usually laughing
countnanc.
“Whr is th commandr in chif?” askd Bolkónski.
“Hr, in that hous,” answrd th adjutant.
“Wll, is it tru that it’s pac and capitulation?” askd
Nsvítski.
“I was going to ask you. I know nothing xcpt that it was all I could
do to gt hr.”
“And w, my dar boy! It’s trribl! I was wrong to laugh at Mack,
w’r gtting it still wors,” said Nsvítski. “But sit down and
hav somthing to at.”
“You won’t b abl to find ithr your baggag or anything ls now,
Princ. And God only knows whr your man Ptr is,” said th othr
adjutant.
“Whr ar hadquartrs?”
“W ar to spnd th night in Znaim.”
“Wll, I hav got all I nd into packs for two horss,” said
Nsvítski. “Thy’v mad up splndid packs for m—fit to cross
th Bohmian mountains with. It’s a bad lookout, old fllow! But
what’s th mattr with you? You must b ill to shivr lik that,” h
addd, noticing that Princ Andrw wincd as at an lctric shock.
“It’s nothing,” rplid Princ Andrw.
H had just rmmbrd his rcnt ncountr with th doctor’s wif and
th convoy officr.
“What is th commandr in chif doing hr?” h askd.
“I can’t mak out at all,” said Nsvítski.
“Wll, all I can mak out is that vrything is abominabl,
abominabl, quit abominabl!” said Princ Andrw, and h wnt off to
th hous whr th commandr in chif was.
Passing by Kutúzov’s carriag and th xhaustd saddl horss of
his suit, with thir Cossacks who wr talking loudly togthr, Princ
Andrw ntrd th passag. Kutúzov himslf, h was told, was in th
hous with Princ Bagratión and Wyrothr. Wyrothr was th Austrian
gnral who had succdd Schmidt. In th passag littl Kozlóvski was
squatting on his hls in front of a clrk. Th clrk, with cuffs turnd
up, was hastily writing at a tub turnd bottom upwards. Kozlóvski’s
fac lookd worn—h too had vidntly not slpt all night. H glancd
at Princ Andrw and did not vn nod to him.
“Scond lin... hav you writtn it?” h continud dictating to th
clrk. “Th Kiv Grnadirs, Podolian...”
“On can’t writ so fast, your honor,” said th clrk, glancing
angrily and disrspctfully at Kozlóvski.
Through th door cam th sounds of Kutúzov’s voic, xcitd and
dissatisfid, intrruptd by anothr, an unfamiliar voic. From th
sound of ths voics, th inattntiv way Kozlóvski lookd at him, th
disrspctful mannr of th xhaustd clrk, th fact that th clrk and
Kozlóvski wr squatting on th floor by a tub so nar to th commandr
in chif, and from th noisy laughtr of th Cossacks holding th
horss nar th window, Princ Andrw flt that somthing important and
disastrous was about to happn.
H turnd to Kozlóvski with urgnt qustions.
“Immdiatly, Princ,” said Kozlóvski. “Dispositions for
Bagratión.”
“What about capitulation?”
“Nothing of th sort. Ordrs ar issud for a battl.”
Princ Andrw movd toward th door from whnc voics wr hard.
Just as h was going to opn it th sounds casd, th door opnd, and
Kutúzov with his agl nos and puffy fac appard in th doorway.
Princ Andrw stood right in front of Kutúzov but th xprssion of
th commandr in chif’s on sound y showd him to b so proccupid
with thoughts and anxitis as to b oblivious of his prsnc. H
lookd straight at his adjutant’s fac without rcognizing him.
“Wll, hav you finishd?” said h to Kozlóvski.
“On momnt, your xcllncy.”
Bagratión, a gaunt middl-agd man of mdium hight with a firm,
impassiv fac of Orintal typ, cam out aftr th commandr in chif.
“I hav th honor to prsnt myslf,” rpatd Princ Andrw rathr
loudly, handing Kutúzov an nvlop.
“Ah, from Vinna? Vry good. Latr, latr!”
Kutúzov wnt out into th porch with Bagratión.
“Wll, good-by, Princ,” said h to Bagratión. “My blssing, and
may Christ b with you in your grat ndavor!”
His fac suddnly softnd and tars cam into his ys. With his lft
hand h drw Bagratión toward him, and with his right, on which h wor
a ring, h mad th sign of th cross ovr him with a gstur vidntly
habitual, offring his puffy chk, but Bagratión kissd him on th
nck instad.
“Christ b with you!” Kutúzov rpatd and wnt toward his
carriag. “Gt in with m,” said h to Bolkónski.
“Your xcllncy, I should lik to b of us hr. Allow m to rmain
with Princ Bagratión’s dtachmnt.”
“Gt in,” said Kutúzov, and noticing that Bolkónski still dlayd,
h addd: “I nd good officrs myslf, nd thm myslf!”
Thy got into th carriag and drov for a fw minuts in silnc.
“Thr is still much, much bfor us,” h said, as if with an old
man’s pntration h undrstood all that was passing in Bolkónski’s
mind. “If a tnth part of his dtachmnt rturns I shall thank God,”
h addd as if spaking to himslf.
Princ Andrw glancd at Kutúzov’s fac only a foot distant from him
and involuntarily noticd th carfully washd sams of th scar nar
his tmpl, whr an Ismail bullt had pircd his skull, and th mpty
y sockt. “Ys, h has a right to spak so calmly of thos mn’s
dath,” thought Bolkónski.
“That is why I bg to b snt to that dtachmnt,” h said.
Kutúzov did not rply. H smd to hav forgottn what h had bn
saying, and sat plungd in thought. Fiv minuts latr, gntly swaying
on th soft springs of th carriag, h turnd to Princ Andrw.
Thr was not a trac of agitation on his fac. With dlicat irony h
qustiond Princ Andrw about th dtails of his intrviw with th
mpror, about th rmarks h had hard at court concrning th Krms
affair, and about som ladis thy both knw.
CHAPTR XIV
On Novmbr 1 Kutúzov had rcivd, through a spy, nws that th army
h commandd was in an almost hoplss position. Th spy rportd that
th Frnch, aftr crossing th bridg at Vinna, wr advancing in
immns forc upon Kutúzov’s lin of communication with th troops
that wr arriving from Russia. If Kutúzov dcidd to rmain at Krms,
Napolon’s army of on hundrd and fifty thousand mn would cut him
off compltly and surround his xhaustd army of forty thousand, and h
would find himslf in th position of Mack at Ulm. If Kutúzov dcidd
to abandon th road conncting him with th troops arriving from Russia,
h would hav to march with no road into unknown parts of th Bohmian
mountains, dfnding himslf against suprior forcs of th nmy and
abandoning all hop of a junction with Buxhöwdn. If Kutúzov dcidd
to rtrat along th road from Krms to Olmütz, to unit with th
troops arriving from Russia, h riskd bing forstalld on that road
by th Frnch who had crossd th Vinna bridg, and ncumbrd by his
baggag and transport, having to accpt battl on th march against an
nmy thr tims as strong, who would hm him in from two sids.
Kutúzov chos this lattr cours.
Th Frnch, th spy rportd, having crossd th Vinna bridg, wr
advancing by forcd marchs toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six mils
off on th lin of Kutúzov’s rtrat. If h rachd Znaim bfor th
Frnch, thr would b grat hop of saving th army; to lt th
Frnch forstall him at Znaim mant th xposur of his whol army to a
disgrac such as that of Ulm, or to uttr dstruction. But to forstall
th Frnch with his whol army was impossibl. Th road for th Frnch
from Vinna to Znaim was shortr and bttr than th road for th
Russians from Krms to Znaim.
Th night h rcivd th nws, Kutúzov snt Bagratión’s vanguard,
four thousand strong, to th right across th hills from th Krms-Znaim
to th Vinna-Znaim road. Bagratión was to mak this march without
rsting, and to halt facing Vinna with Znaim to his rar, and if h
succdd in forstalling th Frnch h was to dlay thm as long as
possibl. Kutúzov himslf with all his transport took th road to
Znaim.
Marching thirty mils that stormy night across roadlss hills, with his
hungry, ill-shod soldirs, and losing a third of his mn as stragglrs
by th way, Bagratión cam out on th Vinna-Znaim road at Hollabrünn
a fw hours ahad of th Frnch who wr approaching Hollabrünn from
Vinna. Kutúzov with his transport had still to march for som days
bfor h could rach Znaim. Hnc Bagratión with his four thousand
hungry, xhaustd mn would hav to dtain for days th whol nmy army
that cam upon him at Hollabrünn, which was clarly impossibl. But
a frak of fat mad th impossibl possibl. Th succss of th trick
that had placd th Vinna bridg in th hands of th Frnch without
a fight ld Murat to try to dciv Kutúzov in a similar way. Mting
Bagratión’s wak dtachmnt on th Znaim road h supposd it to b
Kutúzov’s whol army. To b abl to crush it absolutly h awaitd
th arrival of th rst of th troops who wr on thir way from Vinna,
and with this objct offrd a thr days’ truc on condition that
both armis should rmain in position without moving. Murat dclard
that ngotiations for pac wr alrady procding, and that h
thrfor offrd this truc to avoid unncssary bloodshd. Count
Nostitz, th Austrian gnral occupying th advancd posts, blivd
Murat’s missary and rtird, laving Bagratión’s division
xposd. Anothr missary rod to th Russian lin to announc th pac
ngotiations and to offr th Russian army th thr days’ truc.
Bagratión rplid that h was not authorizd ithr to accpt or rfus
a truc and snt his adjutant to Kutúzov to rport th offr h had
rcivd.
A truc was Kutúzov’s sol chanc of gaining tim, giving
Bagratión’s xhaustd troops som rst, and ltting th transport and
havy convoys (whos movmnts wr concald from th Frnch) advanc
if but on stag narr Znaim. Th offr of a truc gav th only, and
a quit unxpctd, chanc of saving th army. On rciving th nws
h immdiatly dispatchd Adjutant Gnral Wintzingrod, who was in
attndanc on him, to th nmy camp. Wintzingrod was not mrly
to agr to th truc but also to offr trms of capitulation, and
manwhil Kutúzov snt his adjutants back to hastn to th utmost th
movmnts of th baggag trains of th ntir army along th Krms-Znaim
road. Bagratión’s xhaustd and hungry dtachmnt, which alon
covrd this movmnt of th transport and of th whol army, had to
rmain stationary in fac of an nmy ight tims as strong as itslf.
Kutúzov’s xpctations that th proposals of capitulation (which wr
in no way binding) might giv tim for part of th transport to pass,
and also that Murat’s mistak would vry soon b discovrd, provd
corrct. As soon as Bonapart (who was at Schönbrunn, sixtn mils
from Hollabrünn) rcivd Murat’s dispatch with th proposal of a
truc and a capitulation, h dtctd a rus and wrot th following
lttr to Murat:
Schönbrunn, 25th Brumair, 1805,
at ight o’clock in th morning
To PRINC MURAT,
I cannot find words to xprss to you my displasur. You command only
my advanc guard, and hav no right to arrang an armistic without my
ordr. You ar causing m to los th fruits of a campaign. Brak
th armistic immdiatly and march on th nmy. Inform him that th
gnral who signd that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no
on but th mpror of Russia has that right.
If, howvr, th mpror of Russia ratifis that convntion, I will
ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, dstroy th Russian
army.... You ar in a position to siz its baggag and artillry.
Th Russian mpror’s aid-d-camp is an impostor. Officrs ar
nothing whn thy hav no powrs; this on had non.... Th Austrians
lt thmslvs b trickd at th crossing of th Vinna bridg, you ar
ltting yourslf b trickd by an aid-d-camp of th mpror.
NAPOLON
Bonapart’s adjutant rod full gallop with this mnacing lttr to
Murat. Bonapart himslf, not trusting to his gnrals, movd with all
th Guards to th fild of battl, afraid of ltting a rady victim
scap, and Bagratión’s four thousand mn mrrily lightd campfirs,
drid and warmd thmslvs, cookd thir porridg for th first tim
for thr days, and not on of thm knw or imagind what was in stor
for him.
CHAPTR XV
Btwn thr and four o’clock in th aftrnoon Princ Andrw, who
had prsistd in his rqust to Kutúzov, arrivd at Grunth and rportd
himslf to Bagratión. Bonapart’s adjutant had not yt rachd
Murat’s dtachmnt and th battl had not yt bgun. In Bagratión’s
dtachmnt no on knw anything of th gnral position of affairs. Thy
talkd of pac but did not bliv in its possibility; othrs talkd
of a battl but also disblivd in th narnss of an ngagmnt.
Bagratión, knowing Bolkónski to b a favorit and trustd adjutant,
rcivd him with distinction and spcial marks of favor, xplaining to
him that thr would probably b an ngagmnt that day or th nxt, and
giving him full librty to rmain with him during th battl or to join
th rarguard and hav an y on th ordr of rtrat, “which is also
vry important.”
“Howvr, thr will hardly b an ngagmnt today,” said Bagratión
as if to rassur Princ Andrw.
“If h is on of th ordinary littl staff dandis snt to arn a
mdal h can gt his rward just as wll in th rarguard, but if h
wishs to stay with m, lt him... h’ll b of us hr if h’s a
brav officr,” thought Bagratión. Princ Andrw, without rplying,
askd th princ’s prmission to rid round th position to s th
disposition of th forcs, so as to know his barings should h b snt
to xcut an ordr. Th officr on duty, a handsom, lgantly drssd
man with a diamond ring on his forfingr, who was fond of spaking
Frnch though h spok it badly, offrd to conduct Princ Andrw.
On all sids thy saw rain-soakd officrs with djctd facs who
smd to b sking somthing, and soldirs dragging doors, bnchs,
and fncing from th villag.
“Thr now, Princ! W can’t stop thos fllows,” said th staff
officr pointing to th soldirs. “Th officrs don’t kp thm in
hand. And thr,” h pointd to a sutlr’s tnt, “thy crowd in
and sit. This morning I turnd thm all out and now look, it’s full
again. I must go thr, Princ, and scar thm a bit. It won’t tak a
momnt.”
“Ys, lt’s go in and I will gt myslf a roll and som chs,”
said Princ Andrw who had not yt had tim to at anything.
“Why didn’t you mntion it, Princ? I would hav offrd you
somthing.”
Thy dismountd and ntrd th tnt. Svral officrs, with flushd and
wary facs, wr sitting at th tabl ating and drinking.
“Now what dos this man, gntlmn?” said th staff officr, in
th rproachful ton of a man who has rpatd th sam thing mor
than onc. “You know it won’t do to lav your posts lik this.
Th princ gav ordrs that no on should lav his post. Now you,
Captain,” and h turnd to a thin, dirty littl artillry officr who
without his boots (h had givn thm to th cantn kpr to dry),
in only his stockings, ros whn thy ntrd, smiling not altogthr
comfortably.
“Wll, arn’t you ashamd of yourslf, Captain Túshin?” h
continud. “On would think that as an artillry officr you would st
a good xampl, yt hr you ar without your boots! Th alarm will b
soundd and you’ll b in a prtty position without your boots!” (Th
staff officr smild.) “Kindly rturn to your posts, gntlmn, all of
you, all!” h addd in a ton of command.
Princ Andrw smild involuntarily as h lookd at th artillry officr
Túshin, who silnt and smiling, shifting from on stockingd foot to
th othr, glancd inquiringly with his larg, intllignt, kindly ys
from Princ Andrw to th staff officr.
“Th soldirs say it fls asir without boots,” said Captain
Túshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortabl position, vidntly wishing
to adopt a jocular ton. But bfor h had finishd h flt that his
jst was unaccptabl and had not com off. H grw confusd.
“Kindly rturn to your posts,” said th staff officr trying to
prsrv his gravity.
Princ Andrw glancd again at th artillry officr’s small figur.
Thr was somthing pculiar about it, quit unsoldirly, rathr comic,
but xtrmly attractiv.
Th staff officr and Princ Andrw mountd thir horss and rod on.
Having riddn byond th villag, continually mting and ovrtaking
soldirs and officrs of various rgimnts, thy saw on thir lft som
ntrnchmnts bing thrown up, th frshly dug clay of which showd up
rd. Svral battalions of soldirs, in thir shirt slvs dspit
th cold wind, swarmd in ths arthworks lik a host of whit ants;
spadfuls of rd clay wr continually bing thrown up from bhind th
bank by unsn hands. Princ Andrw and th officr rod up, lookd at
th ntrnchmnt, and wnt on again. Just bhind it thy cam upon som
dozns of soldirs, continually rplacd by othrs, who ran from th
ntrnchmnt. Thy had to hold thir noss and put thir horss to a
trot to scap from th poisond atmosphr of ths latrins.
“Voilà l’agrmnt ds camps, monsiur l princ,” * said th
staff officr.
    * “This is a plasur on gts in camp, Princ.”
Thy rod up th opposit hill. From thr th Frnch could alrady b
sn. Princ Andrw stoppd and bgan xamining th position.
“That’s our battry,” said th staff officr indicating th
highst point. “It’s in charg of th qur fllow w saw without
his boots. You can s vrything from thr; lt’s go thr,
Princ.”
“Thank you vry much, I will go on alon,” said Princ Andrw,
wishing to rid himslf of this staff officr’s company, “plas
don’t troubl yourslf furthr.”
Th staff officr rmaind bhind and Princ Andrw rod on alon.
Th farthr forward and narr th nmy h wnt, th mor ordrly and
chrful wr th troops. Th gratst disordr and dprssion had bn
in th baggag train h had passd that morning on th Znaim road svn
mils away from th Frnch. At Grunth also som apprhnsion and alarm
could b flt, but th narr Princ Andrw cam to th Frnch lins th
mor confidnt was th apparanc of our troops. Th soldirs in
thir gratcoats wr rangd in lins, th srgants major and company
officrs wr counting th mn, poking th last man in ach sction in
th ribs and tlling him to hold his hand up. Soldirs scattrd ovr
th whol plac wr dragging logs and brushwood and wr building
shltrs with mrry chattr and laughtr; around th firs sat othrs,
drssd and undrssd, drying thir shirts and lg bands or mnding
boots or ovrcoats and crowding round th boilrs and porridg cookrs.
In on company dinnr was rady, and th soldirs wr gazing agrly
at th staming boilr, waiting till th sampl, which a quartrmastr
srgant was carrying in a woodn bowl to an officr who sat on a log
bfor his shltr, had bn tastd.
Anothr company, a lucky on for not all th companis had vodka,
crowdd round a pockmarkd, broad-shouldrd srgant major who, tilting
a kg, filld on aftr anothr th cantn lids hld out to him. Th
soldirs liftd th cantn lids to thir lips with rvrntial facs,
mptid thm, rolling th vodka in thir mouths, and walkd away from
th srgant major with brightnd xprssions, licking thir lips and
wiping thm on th slvs of thir gratcoats. All thir facs wr
as srn as if all this wr happning at hom awaiting pacful
ncampmnt, and not within sight of th nmy bfor an action in
which at last half of thm would b lft on th fild. Aftr passing a
chassur rgimnt and in th lins of th Kiv grnadirs—fin fllows
busy with similar pacful affairs—nar th shltr of th rgimntal
commandr, highr than and diffrnt from th othrs, Princ Andrw cam
out in front of a platoon of grnadirs bfor whom lay a nakd man. Two
soldirs hld him whil two othrs wr flourishing thir switchs and
striking him rgularly on his bar back. Th man shrikd unnaturally.
A stout major was pacing up and down th lin, and rgardlss of th
scrams kpt rpating:
“It’s a sham for a soldir to stal; a soldir must b honst,
honorabl, and brav, but if h robs his fllows thr is no honor in
him, h’s a scoundrl. Go on! Go on!”
So th swishing sound of th stroks, and th dsprat but unnatural
scrams, continud.
“Go on, go on!” said th major.
A young officr with a bwildrd and paind xprssion on his fac
stppd away from th man and lookd round inquiringly at th adjutant
as h rod by.
Princ Andrw, having rachd th front lin, rod along it. Our front
lin and that of th nmy wr far apart on th right and lft flanks,
but in th cntr whr th mn with a flag of truc had passd that
morning, th lins wr so nar togthr that th mn could s on
anothr’s facs and spak to on anothr. Bsids th soldirs who
formd th pickt lin on ithr sid, thr wr many curious onlookrs
who, jsting and laughing, stard at thir strang forign nmis.
Sinc arly morning—dspit an injunction not to approach th pickt
lin—th officrs had bn unabl to kp sight-srs away. Th
soldirs forming th pickt lin, lik showmn xhibiting a curiosity,
no longr lookd at th Frnch but paid attntion to th sight-srs and
grw wary waiting to b rlivd. Princ Andrw haltd to hav a look
at th Frnch.
“Look! Look thr!” on soldir was saying to anothr, pointing to a
Russian musktr who had gon up to th pickt lin with an officr and
was rapidly and xcitdly talking to a Frnch grnadir. “Hark to him
jabbring! Fin, isn’t it? It’s all th Frnchy can do to kp up
with him. Thr now, Sídorov!”
“Wait a bit and listn. It’s fin!” answrd Sídorov, who was
considrd an adpt at Frnch.
Th soldir to whom th laughrs rfrrd was Dólokhov. Princ Andrw
rcognizd him and stoppd to listn to what h was saying. Dólokhov
had com from th lft flank whr thir rgimnt was stationd, with
his captain.
“Now thn, go on, go on!” incitd th officr, bnding forward and
trying not to los a word of th spch which was incomprhnsibl to
him. “Mor, plas: mor! What’s h saying?”
Dólokhov did not answr th captain; h had bn drawn into a hot
disput with th Frnch grnadir. Thy wr naturally talking about th
campaign. Th Frnchman, confusing th Austrians with th Russians, was
trying to prov that th Russians had surrndrd and had fld all
th way from Ulm, whil Dólokhov maintaind that th Russians had not
surrndrd but had batn th Frnch.
“W hav ordrs to driv you off hr, and w shall driv you off,”
said Dólokhov.
“Only tak car you and your Cossacks ar not all capturd!” said
th Frnch grnadir.
Th Frnch onlookrs and listnrs laughd.
“W’ll mak you danc as w did undr Suvórov...,” * said
Dólokhov.
    * “On vous fra dansr.”
“Qu’ st-c qu’il chant?” * askd a Frnchman.
    * “What’s h singing about?”
“It’s ancint history,” said anothr, gussing that it rfrrd to
a formr war. “Th mpror will tach your Suvara as h has taught th
othrs...”
“Bonapart...” bgan Dólokhov, but th Frnchman intrruptd him.
“Not Bonapart. H is th mpror! Sacr nom...!” crid h angrily.
“Th dvil skin your mpror.”
And Dólokhov swor at him in coars soldir’s Russian and shouldring
his muskt walkd away.
“Lt us go, Iván Lukích,” h said to th captain.
“Ah, that’s th way to talk Frnch,” said th pickt soldirs.
“Now, Sídorov, you hav a try!”
Sídorov, turning to th Frnch, winkd, and bgan to jabbr maninglss
sounds vry fast: “Kari, mala, tafa, safi, mutr, Kaská,” h said,
trying to giv an xprssiv intonation to his voic.
“Ho! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!” cam pals of such halthy
and good-humord laughtr from th soldirs that it infctd th Frnch
involuntarily, so much so that th only thing lft to do smd to b
to unload th muskts, xplod th ammunition, and all rturn hom as
quickly as possibl.
But th guns rmaind loadd, th loophols in blockhouss and
ntrnchmnts lookd out just as mnacingly, and th unlimbrd cannon
confrontd on anothr as bfor.
CHAPTR XVI
Having riddn round th whol lin from right flank to lft, Princ
Andrw mad his way up to th battry from which th staff officr had
told him th whol fild could b sn. Hr h dismountd, and stoppd
bsid th farthst of th four unlimbrd cannon. Bfor th guns an
artillry sntry was pacing up and down; h stood at attntion whn th
officr arrivd, but at a sign rsumd his masurd, monotonous pacing.
Bhind th guns wr thir limbrs and still farthr back pickt rops
and artillrymn’s bonfirs. To th lft, not far from th farthst
cannon, was a small, nwly constructd wattl shd from which cam th
sound of officrs’ voics in agr convrsation.
It was tru that a viw ovr narly th whol Russian position and th
gratr part of th nmy’s opnd out from this battry. Just facing
it, on th crst of th opposit hill, th villag of Schön Grabrn
could b sn, and in thr placs to lft and right th Frnch troops
amid th smok of thir campfirs, th gratr part of whom wr
vidntly in th villag itslf and bhind th hill. To th lft from
that villag, amid th smok, was somthing rsmbling a battry, but it
was impossibl to s it clarly with th nakd y. Our right flank was
postd on a rathr stp inclin which dominatd th Frnch position.
Our infantry wr stationd thr, and at th farthst point th
dragoons. In th cntr, whr Túshin’s battry stood and from which
Princ Andrw was survying th position, was th asist and most
dirct dscnt and ascnt to th brook sparating us from Schön
Grabrn. On th lft our troops wr clos to a cops, in which smokd
th bonfirs of our infantry who wr flling wood. Th Frnch lin was
widr than ours, and it was plain that thy could asily outflank us
on both sids. Bhind our position was a stp and dp dip, making it
difficult for artillry and cavalry to rtir. Princ Andrw took
out his notbook and, laning on th cannon, sktchd a plan of th
position. H mad som nots on two points, intnding to mntion thm to
Bagratión. His ida was, first, to concntrat all th artillry in th
cntr, and scondly, to withdraw th cavalry to th othr sid of th
dip. Princ Andrw, bing always nar th commandr in chif, closly
following th mass movmnts and gnral ordrs, and constantly studying
historical accounts of battls, involuntarily picturd to himslf th
cours of vnts in th forthcoming action in broad outlin. H
imagind only important possibilitis: “If th nmy attacks th right
flank,” h said to himslf, “th Kiv grnadirs and th Podólsk
chassurs must hold thir position till rsrvs from th cntr
com up. In that cas th dragoons could succssfully mak a flank
countrattack. If thy attack our cntr w, having th cntr battry
on this high ground, shall withdraw th lft flank undr its covr, and
rtrat to th dip by chlons.” So h rasond.... All th tim
h had bn bsid th gun, h had hard th voics of th officrs
distinctly, but as oftn happns had not undrstood a word of what thy
wr saying. Suddnly, howvr, h was struck by a voic coming from th
shd, and its ton was so sincr that h could not but listn.
“No, frind,” said a plasant and, as it smd to Princ Andrw, a
familiar voic, “what I say is that if it wr possibl to know
what is byond dath, non of us would b afraid of it. That’s so,
frind.”
Anothr, a youngr voic, intrruptd him: “Afraid or not, you can’t
scap it anyhow.”
“All th sam, on is afraid! Oh, you clvr popl,” said a third
manly voic intrrupting thm both. “Of cours you artillry mn ar
vry wis, bcaus you can tak vrything along with you—vodka and
snacks.”
And th ownr of th manly voic, vidntly an infantry officr,
laughd.
“Ys, on is afraid,” continud th first spakr, h of th
familiar voic. “On is afraid of th unknown, that’s what it is.
Whatvr w may say about th soul going to th sky... w know thr is
no sky but only an atmosphr.”
Th manly voic again intrruptd th artillry officr.
“Wll, stand us som of your hrb vodka, Túshin,” it said.
“Why,” thought Princ Andrw, “that’s th captain who stood up
in th sutlr’s hut without his boots.” H rcognizd th agrabl,
philosophizing voic with plasur.
“Som hrb vodka? Crtainly!” said Túshin. “But still, to
conciv a futur lif...”
H did not finish. Just thn thr was a whistl in th air; narr and
narr, fastr and loudr, loudr and fastr, a cannon ball, as if it
had not finishd saying what was ncssary, thuddd into th ground nar
th shd with supr human forc, throwing up a mass of arth. Th ground
smd to groan at th trribl impact.
And immdiatly Túshin, with a short pip in th cornr of his mouth
and his kind, intllignt fac rathr pal, rushd out of th shd
followd by th ownr of th manly voic, a dashing infantry officr who
hurrid off to his company, buttoning up his coat as h ran.
CHAPTR XVII
Mounting his hors again Princ Andrw lingrd with th battry,
looking at th puff from th gun that had snt th ball. His ys
ran rapidly ovr th wid spac, but h only saw that th hithrto
motionlss masss of th Frnch now swayd and that thr rally was
a battry to thir lft. Th smok abov it had not yt disprsd. Two
mountd Frnchmn, probably adjutants, wr galloping up th hill. A
small but distinctly visibl nmy column was moving down th hill,
probably to strngthn th front lin. Th smok of th first shot had
not yt disprsd bfor anothr puff appard, followd by a rport.
Th battl had bgun! Princ Andrw turnd his hors and gallopd back
to Grunth to find Princ Bagratión. H hard th cannonad bhind him
growing loudr and mor frqunt. vidntly our guns had bgun to rply.
From th bottom of th slop, whr th parlys had takn plac, cam
th rport of musktry.
Lmarrois had just arrivd at a gallop with Bonapart’s strn lttr,
and Murat, humiliatd and anxious to xpiat his fault, had at onc
movd his forcs to attack th cntr and outflank both th Russian
wings, hoping bfor vning and bfor th arrival of th mpror to
crush th contmptibl dtachmnt that stood bfor him.
“It has bgun. Hr it is!” thought Princ Andrw, fling th
blood rush to his hart. “But whr and how will my Toulon prsnt
itslf?”
Passing btwn th companis that had bn ating porridg and drinking
vodka a quartr of an hour bfor, h saw vrywhr th sam rapid
movmnt of soldirs forming ranks and gtting thir muskts rady,
and on all thir facs h rcognizd th sam agrnss that filld his
hart. “It has bgun! Hr it is, dradful but njoyabl!” was what
th fac of ach soldir and ach officr smd to say.
Bfor h had rachd th mbankmnts that wr bing thrown up, h saw,
in th light of th dull autumn vning, mountd mn coming toward him.
Th formost, waring a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
whit hors, was Princ Bagratión. Princ Andrw stoppd, waiting for
him to com up; Princ Bagratión rind in his hors and rcognizing
Princ Andrw noddd to him. H still lookd ahad whil Princ Andrw
told him what h had sn.
Th fling, “It has bgun! Hr it is!” was sn vn on Princ
Bagratión’s hard brown fac with its half-closd, dull, slpy ys.
Princ Andrw gazd with anxious curiosity at that impassiv fac
and wishd h could tll what, if anything, this man was thinking
and fling at that momnt. “Is thr anything at all bhind that
impassiv fac?” Princ Andrw askd himslf as h lookd. Princ
Bagratión bnt his had in sign of agrmnt with what Princ Andrw
told him, and said, “Vry good!” in a ton that smd to imply that
vrything that took plac and was rportd to him was xactly what h
had forsn. Princ Andrw, out of brath with his rapid rid, spok
quickly. Princ Bagratión, uttring his words with an Orintal accnt,
spok particularly slowly, as if to imprss th fact that thr was no
nd to hurry. Howvr, h put his hors to a trot in th dirction
of Túshin’s battry. Princ Andrw followd with th suit. Bhind
Princ Bagratión rod an officr of th suit, th princ’s prsonal
adjutant, Zhrkóv, an ordrly officr, th staff officr on duty,
riding a fin bobtaild hors, and a civilian—an accountant who had
askd prmission to b prsnt at th battl out of curiosity. Th
accountant, a stout, full-facd man, lookd around him with a naïv
smil of satisfaction and prsntd a strang apparanc among th
hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlt coat, as h joltd on
his hors with a convoy officr’s saddl.
“H wants to s a battl,” said Zhrkóv to Bolkónski, pointing
to th accountant, “but h fls a pain in th pit of his stomach
alrady.”
“Oh, lav off!” said th accountant with a baming but rathr
cunning smil, as if flattrd at bing mad th subjct of Zhrkóv’s
jok, and purposly trying to appar stupidr than h rally was.
“It is vry strang, mon Monsiur Princ,” said th staff officr.
(H rmmbrd that in Frnch thr is som pculiar way of addrssing a
princ, but could not gt it quit right.)
By this tim thy wr all approaching Túshin’s battry, and a ball
struck th ground in front of thm.
“What’s that that has falln?” askd th accountant with a naïv
smil.
“A Frnch pancak,” answrd Zhrkóv.
“So that’s what thy hit with?” askd th accountant. “How
awful!”
H smd to swll with satisfaction. H had hardly finishd spaking
whn thy again hard an unxpctdly violnt whistling which suddnly
ndd with a thud into somthing soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding
a littl to thir right and bhind th accountant, crashd to arth with
his hors. Zhrkóv and th staff officr bnt ovr thir saddls and
turnd thir horss away. Th accountant stoppd, facing th Cossack,
and xamind him with attntiv curiosity. Th Cossack was dad, but th
hors still struggld.
Princ Bagratión scrwd up his ys, lookd round, and, sing th
caus of th confusion, turnd away with indiffrnc, as if to say,
“Is it worth whil noticing trifls?” H rind in his hors with
th car of a skillful ridr and, slightly bnding ovr, disngagd his
sabr which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashiond sabr of
a kind no longr in gnral us. Princ Andrw rmmbrd th story of
Suvórov giving his sabr to Bagratión in Italy, and th rcollction
was particularly plasant at that momnt. Thy had rachd th battry
at which Princ Andrw had bn whn h xamind th battlfild.
“Whos company?” askd Princ Bagratión of an artillryman standing
by th ammunition wagon.
H askd, “Whos company?” but h rally mant, “Ar you
frightnd hr?” and th artillryman undrstood him.
“Captain Túshin’s, your xcllncy!” shoutd th rd-haird,
frckld gunnr in a mrry voic, standing to attntion.
“Ys, ys,” muttrd Bagratión as if considring somthing, and h
rod past th limbrs to th farthst cannon.
As h approachd, a ringing shot issud from it dafning him and his
suit, and in th smok that suddnly surroundd th gun thy could s
th gunnrs who had sizd it straining to roll it quickly back to its
formr position. A hug, broad-shouldrd gunnr, Numbr On, holding
a mop, his lgs far apart, sprang to th whl; whil Numbr Two with
a trmbling hand placd a charg in th cannon’s mouth. Th short,
round-shouldrd Captain Túshin, stumbling ovr th tail of th gun
carriag, movd forward and, not noticing th gnral, lookd out
shading his ys with his small hand.
“Lift it two lins mor and it will b just right,” crid h in a
fbl voic to which h trid to impart a dashing not, ill-suitd to
his wak figur. “Numbr Two!” h squakd. “Fir, Mdvdv!”
Bagratión calld to him, and Túshin, raising thr fingrs to his cap
with a bashful and awkward gstur not at all lik a military salut
but lik a prist’s bndiction, approachd th gnral. Though
Túshin’s guns had bn intndd to cannonad th vally, h was
firing incndiary balls at th villag of Schön Grabrn visibl just
opposit, in front of which larg masss of Frnch wr advancing.
No on had givn Túshin ordrs whr and at what to fir, but aftr
consulting his srgant major, Zakharchnko, for whom h had grat
rspct, h had dcidd that it would b a good thing to st fir to th
villag. “Vry good!” said Bagratión in rply to th officr’s
rport, and bgan dlibratly to xamin th whol battlfild xtndd
bfor him. Th Frnch had advancd narst on our right. Blow th
hight on which th Kiv rgimnt was stationd, in th hollow whr th
rivult flowd, th soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musktry was
hard, and much farthr to th right byond th dragoons, th officr of
th suit pointd out to Bagratión a Frnch column that was outflanking
us. To th lft th horizon boundd by th adjacnt wood. Princ
Bagratión ordrd two battalions from th cntr to b snt to
rinforc th right flank. Th officr of th suit vnturd to rmark
to th princ that if ths battalions wnt away, th guns would rmain
without support. Princ Bagratión turnd to th officr and with his
dull ys lookd at him in silnc. It smd to Princ Andrw that th
officr’s rmark was just and that rally no answr could b mad to
it. But at that momnt an adjutant gallopd up with a mssag from th
commandr of th rgimnt in th hollow and nws that immns masss
of th Frnch wr coming down upon thm and that his rgimnt was in
disordr and was rtrating upon th Kiv grnadirs. Princ Bagratión
bowd his had in sign of assnt and approval. H rod off at a walk to
th right and snt an adjutant to th dragoons with ordrs to attack th
Frnch. But this adjutant rturnd half an hour latr with th nws that
th commandr of th dragoons had alrady rtratd byond th dip in
th ground, as a havy fir had bn opnd on him and h was losing
mn uslssly, and so had hastnd to throw som sharpshootrs into th
wood.
“Vry good!” said Bagratión.
As h was laving th battry, firing was hard on th lft also, and
as it was too far to th lft flank for him to hav tim to go thr
himslf, Princ Bagratión snt Zhrkóv to tll th gnral in command
(th on who had paradd his rgimnt bfor Kutúzov at Braunau) that
h must rtrat as quickly as possibl bhind th hollow in th rar,
as th right flank would probably not b abl to withstand th nmy’s
attack vry long. About Túshin and th battalion that had bn in
support of his battry all was forgottn. Princ Andrw listnd
attntivly to Bagratión’s colloquis with th commanding officrs
and th ordrs h gav thm and, to his surpris, found that no ordrs
wr rally givn, but that Princ Bagratión trid to mak it appar
that vrything don by ncssity, by accidnt, or by th will of
subordinat commandrs was don, if not by his dirct command, at last
in accord with his intntions. Princ Andrw noticd, howvr, that
though what happnd was du to chanc and was indpndnt of th
commandr’s will, owing to th tact Bagratión showd, his prsnc
was vry valuabl. Officrs who approachd him with disturbd
countnancs bcam calm; soldirs and officrs grtd him gaily, grw
mor chrful in his prsnc, and wr vidntly anxious to display
thir courag bfor him.
CHAPTR XVIII
Princ Bagratión, having rachd th highst point of our right flank,
bgan riding downhill to whr th roll of musktry was hard but whr
on account of th smok nothing could b sn. Th narr thy got to
th hollow th lss thy could s but th mor thy flt th narnss
of th actual battlfild. Thy bgan to mt woundd mn. On with a
blding had and no cap was bing draggd along by two soldirs who
supportd him undr th arms. Thr was a gurgl in his throat and h
was spitting blood. A bullt had vidntly hit him in th throat or
mouth. Anothr was walking sturdily by himslf but without his muskt,
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just bn hurt, whil
blood from it was straming ovr his gratcoat as from a bottl. H had
that momnt bn woundd and his fac showd far rathr than suffring.
Crossing a road thy dscndd a stp inclin and saw svral mn
lying on th ground; thy also mt a crowd of soldirs som of whom wr
unwoundd. Th soldirs wr ascnding th hill brathing havily, and
dspit th gnral’s prsnc wr talking loudly and gsticulating.
In front of thm rows of gray cloaks wr alrady visibl through th
smok, and an officr catching sight of Bagratión rushd shouting aftr
th crowd of rtrating soldirs, ordring thm back. Bagratión rod up
to th ranks along which shots crackld now hr and now thr, drowning
th sound of voics and th shouts of command. Th whol air rkd with
smok. Th xcitd facs of th soldirs wr blacknd with it. Som
wr using thir ramrods, othrs putting powdr on th touchpans or
taking chargs from thir pouchs, whil othrs wr firing, though who
thy wr firing at could not b sn for th smok which thr was no
wind to carry away. A plasant humming and whistling of bullts wr
oftn hard. “What is this?” thought Princ Andrw approaching th
crowd of soldirs. “It can’t b an attack, for thy ar not moving;
it can’t b a squar—for thy ar not drawn up for that.”
Th commandr of th rgimnt, a thin, fbl-looking old man with a
plasant smil—his ylids drooping mor than half ovr his old ys,
giving him a mild xprssion, rod up to Bagratión and wlcomd him as
a host wlcoms an honord gust. H rportd that his rgimnt had
bn attackd by Frnch cavalry and that, though th attack had bn
rpulsd, h had lost mor than half his mn. H said th attack
had bn rpulsd, mploying this military trm to dscrib what had
occurrd to his rgimnt, but in rality h did not himslf know what
had happnd during that half-hour to th troops ntrustd to him, and
could not say with crtainty whthr th attack had bn rpulsd or his
rgimnt had bn brokn up. All h knw was that at th commncmnt
of th action balls and shlls bgan flying all ovr his rgimnt and
hitting mn and that aftrwards somon had shoutd “Cavalry!” and
our mn had bgun firing. Thy wr still firing, not at th cavalry
which had disappard, but at Frnch infantry who had com into th
hollow and wr firing at our mn. Princ Bagratión bowd his had as a
sign that this was xactly what h had dsird and xpctd. Turning
to his adjutant h ordrd him to bring down th two battalions of th
Sixth Chassurs whom thy had just passd. Princ Andrw was struck by
th changd xprssion on Princ Bagratión’s fac at this momnt. It
xprssd th concntratd and happy rsolution you s on th fac of
a man who on a hot day taks a final run bfor plunging into th watr.
Th dull, slpy xprssion was no longr thr, nor th affctation
of profound thought. Th round, stady, hawk’s ys lookd bfor him
agrly and rathr disdainfully, not rsting on anything although his
movmnts wr still slow and masurd.
Th commandr of th rgimnt turnd to Princ Bagratión, ntrating
him to go back as it was too dangrous to rmain whr thy wr.
“Plas, your xcllncy, for God’s sak!” h kpt saying,
glancing for support at an officr of th suit who turnd away
from him. “Thr, you s!” and h drw attntion to th bullts
whistling, singing, and hissing continually around thm. H spok in th
ton of ntraty and rproach that a carpntr uss to a gntlman who
has pickd up an ax: “W ar usd to it, but you, sir, will blistr
your hands.” H spok as if thos bullts could not kill him, and his
half-closd ys gav still mor prsuasivnss to his words. Th staff
officr joind in th colonl’s appals, but Bagratión did not rply;
h only gav an ordr to cas firing and r-form, so as to giv room
for th two approaching battalions. Whil h was spaking, th curtain
of smok that had concald th hollow, drivn by a rising wind, bgan
to mov from right to lft as if drawn by an invisibl hand, and th
hill opposit, with th Frnch moving about on it, opnd out bfor
thm. All ys fastnd involuntarily on this Frnch column advancing
against thm and winding down ovr th unvn ground. On could alrady
s th soldirs’ shaggy caps, distinguish th officrs from th mn,
and s th standard flapping against its staff.
“Thy march splndidly,” rmarkd somon in Bagratión’s suit.
Th had of th column had alrady dscndd into th hollow. Th clash
would tak plac on this sid of it...
Th rmains of our rgimnt which had bn in action rapidly formd up
and movd to th right; from bhind it, disprsing th laggards, cam
two battalions of th Sixth Chassurs in fin ordr. Bfor thy had
rachd Bagratión, th wighty trad of th mass of mn marching in
stp could b hard. On thir lft flank, narst to Bagratión, marchd
a company commandr, a fin round-facd man, with a stupid and happy
xprssion—th sam man who had rushd out of th wattl shd. At that
momnt h was clarly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fllow h
would appar as h passd th commandr.
With th slf-satisfaction of a man on parad, h stppd lightly with
his muscular lgs as if sailing along, strtching himslf to his full
hight without th smallst ffort, his as contrasting with th havy
trad of th soldirs who wr kping stp with him. H carrid clos
to his lg a narrow unshathd sword (small, curvd, and not lik a ral
wapon) and lookd now at th suprior officrs and now back at th mn
without losing stp, his whol powrful body turning flxibly. It was as
if all th powrs of his soul wr concntratd on passing th commandr
in th bst possibl mannr, and fling that h was doing it wll h
was happy. “Lft... lft... lft...” h smd to rpat to himslf
at ach altrnat stp; and in tim to this, with strn but varid
facs, th wall of soldirs burdnd with knapsacks and muskts marchd
in stp, and ach on of ths hundrds of soldirs smd to b
rpating to himslf at ach altrnat stp, “Lft... lft...
lft...” A fat major skirtd a bush, puffing and falling out of
stp; a soldir who had falln bhind, his fac showing alarm at his
dfction, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon
ball, claving th air, flw ovr th hads of Bagratión and his suit,
and fll into th column to th masur of “Lft... lft!” “Clos
up!” cam th company commandr’s voic in jaunty tons. Th
soldirs passd in a smicircl round somthing whr th ball had
falln, and an old troopr on th flank, a noncommissiond officr who
had stoppd bsid th dad mn, ran to catch up his lin and, falling
into stp with a hop, lookd back angrily, and through th ominous
silnc and th rgular tramp of ft bating th ground in unison, on
smd to har lft... lft... lft.
“Wll don, lads!” said Princ Bagratión.
“Glad to do our bst, your x’ln-lncy!” cam a confusd shout
from th ranks. A moros soldir marching on th lft turnd his ys on
Bagratión as h shoutd, with an xprssion that smd to say: “W
know that ourslvs!” Anothr, without looking round, as though
faring to rlax, shoutd with his mouth wid opn and passd on.
Th ordr was givn to halt and down knapsacks.
Bagratión rod round th ranks that had marchd past him and
dismountd. H gav th rins to a Cossack, took off and handd ovr his
flt coat, strtchd his lgs, and st his cap straight. Th had of th
Frnch column, with its officrs lading, appard from blow th hill.
“Forward, with God!” said Bagratión, in a rsolut, sonorous voic,
turning for a momnt to th front lin, and slightly swinging his arms,
h wnt forward unasily ovr th rough fild with th awkward gait of
a cavalryman. Princ Andrw flt that an invisibl powr was lading him
forward, and xprincd grat happinss.
Th Frnch wr alrady nar. Princ Andrw, walking bsid Bagratión,
could clarly distinguish thir bandolirs, rd paults, and vn thir
facs. (H distinctly saw an old Frnch officr who, with gaitrd
lgs and turnd-out tos, climbd th hill with difficulty.) Princ
Bagratión gav no furthr ordrs and silntly continud to walk on in
front of th ranks. Suddnly on shot aftr anothr rang out from th
Frnch, smok appard all along thir unvn ranks, and muskt shots
soundd. Svral of our mn fll, among thm th round-facd officr
who had marchd so gaily and complacntly. But at th momnt th first
rport was hard, Bagratión lookd round and shoutd, “Hurrah!”
“Hurrah—ah!—ah!” rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and
passing Bagratión and racing on anothr thy rushd in an irrgular
but joyous and agr crowd down th hill at thir disordrd fo.
CHAPTR XIX
Th attack of th Sixth Chassurs scurd th rtrat of our right
flank. In th cntr Túshin’s forgottn battry, which had managd to
st fir to th Schön Grabrn villag, dlayd th Frnch advanc. Th
Frnch wr putting out th fir which th wind was sprading, and thus
gav us tim to rtrat. Th rtirmnt of th cntr to th othr sid
of th dip in th ground at th rar was hurrid and noisy, but th
diffrnt companis did not gt mixd. But our lft—which consistd
of th Azóv and Podólsk infantry and th Pávlograd hussars—was
simultanously attackd and outflankd by suprior Frnch forcs undr
Lanns and was thrown into confusion. Bagratión had snt Zhrkóv
to th gnral commanding that lft flank with ordrs to rtrat
immdiatly.
Zhrkóv, not rmoving his hand from his cap, turnd his hors about
and gallopd off. But no soonr had h lft Bagratión than his courag
faild him. H was sizd by panic and could not go whr it was
dangrous.
Having rachd th lft flank, instad of going to th front whr th
firing was, h bgan to look for th gnral and his staff whr thy
could not possibly b, and so did not dlivr th ordr.
Th command of th lft flank blongd by sniority to th commandr of
th rgimnt Kutúzov had rviwd at Braunau and in which Dólokhov was
srving as a privat. But th command of th xtrm lft flank had bn
assignd to th commandr of th Pávlograd rgimnt in which Rostóv
was srving, and a misundrstanding aros. Th two commandrs wr much
xaspratd with on anothr and, long aftr th action had bgun on
th right flank and th Frnch wr alrady advancing, wr ngagd
in discussion with th sol objct of offnding on anothr. But th
rgimnts, both cavalry and infantry, wr by no mans rady for th
impnding action. From privats to gnral thy wr not xpcting a
battl and wr ngagd in pacful occupations, th cavalry fding th
horss and th infantry collcting wood.
“H highr iss dan I in rank,” said th Grman colonl of th
hussars, flushing and addrssing an adjutant who had riddn up, “so
lt him do what h vill, but I cannot sacrific my hussars... Buglr,
sount z rtrat!”
But hast was bcoming imprativ. Cannon and musktry, mingling
togthr, thundrd on th right and in th cntr, whil th capots
of Lanns’ sharpshootrs wr alrady sn crossing th milldam and
forming up within twic th rang of a muskt shot. Th gnral in
command of th infantry wnt toward his hors with jrky stps, and
having mountd drw himslf up vry straight and tall and rod to th
Pávlograd commandr. Th commandrs mt with polit bows but with
scrt malvolnc in thir harts.
“Onc again, Colonl,” said th gnral, “I can’t lav half
my mn in th wood. I bg of you, I bg of you,” h rpatd, “to
occupy th position and prpar for an attack.”
“I pg of you yourslf not to mix in vot is not your businss!”
suddnly rplid th irat colonl. “If you vr in th cavalry...”
“I am not in th cavalry, Colonl, but I am a Russian gnral and if
you ar not awar of th fact...”
“Quit avar, your xcllncy,” suddnly shoutd th colonl,
touching his hors and turning purpl in th fac. “Vill you b so
goot to com to z front and s dat zis position iss no goot? I don’t
vish to dstroy my mn for your plasur!”
“You forgt yourslf, Colonl. I am not considring my own plasur
and I won’t allow it to b said!”
Taking th colonl’s outburst as a challng to his courag, th
gnral xpandd his chst and rod, frowning, bsid him to th
front lin, as if thir diffrncs would b sttld thr amongst th
bullts. Thy rachd th front, svral bullts spd ovr thm, and
thy haltd in silnc. Thr was nothing frsh to b sn from th
lin, for from whr thy had bn bfor it had bn vidnt that it
was impossibl for cavalry to act among th bushs and brokn ground,
as wll as that th Frnch wr outflanking our lft. Th gnral
and colonl lookd strnly and significantly at on anothr lik two
fighting cocks prparing for battl, ach vainly trying to dtct signs
of cowardic in th othr. Both passd th xamination succssfully. As
thr was nothing to b said, and nithr wishd to giv occasion for
it to b allgd that h had bn th first to lav th rang of fir,
thy would hav rmaind thr for a long tim tsting ach othr’s
courag had it not bn that just thn thy hard th rattl of musktry
and a muffld shout almost bhind thm in th wood. Th Frnch had
attackd th mn collcting wood in th cops. It was no longr possibl
for th hussars to rtrat with th infantry. Thy wr cut off from
th lin of rtrat on th lft by th Frnch. Howvr inconvnint th
position, it was now ncssary to attack in ordr to cut a way through
for thmslvs.
Th squadron in which Rostóv was srving had scarcly tim to mount
bfor it was haltd facing th nmy. Again, as at th nns bridg,
thr was nothing btwn th squadron and th nmy, and again that
trribl dividing lin of uncrtainty and far—rsmbling th lin
sparating th living from th dad—lay btwn thm. All wr
conscious of this unsn lin, and th qustion whthr thy would cross
it or not, and how thy would cross it, agitatd thm all.
Th colonl rod to th front, angrily gav som rply to qustions put
to him by th officrs, and, lik a man dspratly insisting on having
his own way, gav an ordr. No on said anything dfinit, but th rumor
of an attack sprad through th squadron. Th command to form up rang
out and th sabrs whizzd as thy wr drawn from thir scabbards.
Still no on movd. Th troops of th lft flank, infantry and hussars
alik, flt that th commandr did not himslf know what to do, and this
irrsolution communicatd itslf to th mn.
“If only thy would b quick!” thought Rostóv, fling that at last
th tim had com to xprinc th joy of an attack of which h had so
oftn hard from his fllow hussars.
“Fo’ward, with God, lads!” rang out Dnísov’s voic. “At a
twot fo’ward!”
Th horss’ croups bgan to sway in th front lin. Rook pulld at th
rins and startd of his own accord.
Bfor him, on th right, Rostóv saw th front lins of his hussars and
still farthr ahad a dark lin which h could not s distinctly but
took to b th nmy. Shots could b hard, but som way off.
“Fastr!” cam th word of command, and Rostóv flt Rook’s flanks
drooping as h brok into a gallop.
Rostóv anticipatd his hors’s movmnts and bcam mor and mor
latd. H had noticd a solitary tr ahad of him. This tr had bn
in th middl of th lin that had smd so trribl—and now h
had crossd that lin and not only was thr nothing trribl, but
vrything was bcoming mor and mor happy and animatd. “Oh, how I
will slash at him!” thought Rostóv, gripping th hilt of his sabr.
“Hur-a-a-a-ah!” cam a roar of voics. “Lt anyon com my way
now,” thought Rostóv driving his spurs into Rook and ltting him go
at a full gallop so that h outstrippd th othrs. Ahad, th nmy was
alrady visibl. Suddnly somthing lik a birch broom smd to swp
ovr th squadron. Rostóv raisd his sabr, rady to strik, but at
that instant th troopr Nikítnko, who was galloping ahad, shot away
from him, and Rostóv flt as in a dram that h continud to b carrid
forward with unnatural spd but yt stayd on th sam spot. From
bhind him Bondarchúk, an hussar h knw, joltd against him and lookd
angrily at him. Bondarchúk’s hors swrvd and gallopd past.
“How is it I am not moving? I hav falln, I am killd!” Rostóv
askd and answrd at th sam instant. H was alon in th middl of a
fild. Instad of th moving horss and hussars’ backs, h saw nothing
bfor him but th motionlss arth and th stubbl around him. Thr
was warm blood undr his arm. “No, I am woundd and th hors is
killd.” Rook trid to ris on his forlgs but fll back, pinning his
ridr’s lg. Blood was flowing from his had; h struggld but could
not ris. Rostóv also trid to ris but fll back, his sabrtach
having bcom ntangld in th saddl. Whr our mn wr, and whr th
Frnch, h did not know. Thr was no on nar.
Having disntangld his lg, h ros. “Whr, on which sid, was now
th lin that had so sharply dividd th two armis?” h askd himslf
and could not answr. “Can somthing bad hav happnd to m?”
h wondrd as h got up: and at that momnt h flt that somthing
suprfluous was hanging on his bnumbd lft arm. Th wrist flt as if
it wr not his. H xamind his hand carfully, vainly trying to find
blood on it. “Ah, hr ar popl coming,” h thought joyfully,
sing som mn running toward him. “Thy will hlp m!” In front
cam a man waring a strang shako and a blu cloak, swarthy, sunburnd,
and with a hookd nos. Thn cam two mor, and many mor running
bhind. On of thm said somthing strang, not in Russian. In among th
hindmost of ths mn waring similar shakos was a Russian hussar. H
was bing hld by th arms and his hors was bing ld bhind him.
“It must b on of ours, a prisonr. Ys. Can it b that thy will
tak m too? Who ar ths mn?” thought Rostóv, scarcly bliving
his ys. “Can thy b Frnch?” H lookd at th approaching
Frnchmn, and though but a momnt bfor h had bn galloping to gt
at thm and hack thm to pics, thir proximity now smd so awful
that h could not bliv his ys. “Who ar thy? Why ar thy
running? Can thy b coming at m? And why? To kill m? M whom vryon
is so fond of?” H rmmbrd his mothr’s lov for him, and his
family’s, and his frinds’, and th nmy’s intntion to kill him
smd impossibl. “But prhaps thy may do it!” For mor than tn
sconds h stood not moving from th spot or ralizing th situation.
Th formost Frnchman, th on with th hookd nos, was alrady so
clos that th xprssion of his fac could b sn. And th xcitd,
alin fac of that man, his bayont hanging down, holding his brath,
and running so lightly, frightnd Rostóv. H sizd his pistol and,
instad of firing it, flung it at th Frnchman and ran with all his
might toward th bushs. H did not now run with th fling of doubt
and conflict with which h had troddn th nns bridg, but with th
fling of a har fling from th hounds. On singl sntimnt, that
of far for his young and happy lif, possssd his whol bing. Rapidly
laping th furrows, h fld across th fild with th imptuosity h
usd to show at catchplay, now and thn turning his good-naturd, pal,
young fac to look back. A shuddr of trror wnt through him: “No,
bttr not look,” h thought, but having rachd th bushs h glancd
round onc mor. Th Frnch had falln bhind, and just as h lookd
round th first man changd his run to a walk and, turning, shoutd
somthing loudly to a comrad farthr back. Rostóv pausd. “No,
thr’s som mistak,” thought h. “Thy can’t hav wantd to
kill m.” But at th sam tim, his lft arm flt as havy as if
a svnty-pound wight wr tid to it. H could run no mor. Th
Frnchman also stoppd and took aim. Rostóv closd his ys and stoopd
down. On bullt and thn anothr whistld past him. H mustrd his
last rmaining strngth, took hold of his lft hand with his right, and
rachd th bushs. Bhind ths wr som Russian sharpshootrs.
CHAPTR XX
Th infantry rgimnts that had bn caught unawars in th outskirts
of th wood ran out of it, th diffrnt companis gtting mixd, and
rtratd as a disordrly crowd. On soldir, in his far, uttrd th
snslss cry, “Cut off!” that is so trribl in battl, and that
word infctd th whol crowd with a fling of panic.
“Surroundd! Cut off? W’r lost!” shoutd th fugitivs.
Th momnt h hard th firing and th cry from bhind, th gnral
ralizd that somthing dradful had happnd to his rgimnt, and th
thought that h, an xmplary officr of many yars’ srvic who
had nvr bn to blam, might b hld rsponsibl at hadquartrs
for nglignc or infficincy so staggrd him that, forgtting th
rcalcitrant cavalry colonl, his own dignity as a gnral, and abov
all quit forgtting th dangr and all rgard for slf-prsrvation, h
clutchd th cruppr of his saddl and, spurring his hors, gallopd to
th rgimnt undr a hail of bullts which fll around, but fortunatly
missd him. His on dsir was to know what was happning and at any
cost corrct, or rmdy, th mistak if h had mad on, so that h,
an xmplary officr of twnty-two yars’ srvic, who had nvr bn
cnsurd, should not b hld to blam.
Having gallopd safly through th Frnch, h rachd a fild bhind
th cops across which our mn, rgardlss of ordrs, wr running and
dscnding th vally. That momnt of moral hsitation which dcids
th fat of battls had arrivd. Would this disordrly crowd of soldirs
attnd to th voic of thir commandr, or would thy, disrgarding him,
continu thir flight? Dspit his dsprat shouts that usd to sm
so trribl to th soldirs, dspit his furious purpl countnanc
distortd out of all liknss to his formr slf, and th flourishing of
his sabr, th soldirs all continud to run, talking, firing into th
air, and disobying ordrs. Th moral hsitation which dcidd th fat
of battls was vidntly culminating in a panic.
Th gnral had a fit of coughing as a rsult of shouting and of th
powdr smok and stoppd in dspair. vrything smd lost. But at that
momnt th Frnch who wr attacking, suddnly and without any apparnt
rason, ran back and disappard from th outskirts, and Russian
sharpshootrs showd thmslvs in th cops. It was Timókhin’s
company, which alon had maintaind its ordr in th wood and, having
lain in ambush in a ditch, now attackd th Frnch unxpctdly.
Timókhin, armd only with a sword, had rushd at th nmy with such
a dsprat cry and such mad, drunkn dtrmination that, takn by
surpris, th Frnch had thrown down thir muskts and run. Dólokhov,
running bsid Timókhin, killd a Frnchman at clos quartrs and was
th first to siz th surrndring Frnch officr by his collar. Our
fugitivs rturnd, th battalions r-formd, and th Frnch who had
narly cut our lft flank in half wr for th momnt rpulsd. Our
rsrv units wr abl to join up, and th fight was at an nd. Th
rgimntal commandr and Major konómov had stoppd bsid a bridg,
ltting th rtrating companis pass by thm, whn a soldir cam up
and took hold of th commandr’s stirrup, almost laning against him.
Th man was waring a bluish coat of broadcloth, h had no knapsack
or cap, his had was bandagd, and ovr his shouldr a Frnch munition
pouch was slung. H had an officr’s sword in his hand. Th soldir
was pal, his blu ys lookd impudntly into th commandr’s fac,
and his lips wr smiling. Though th commandr was occupid in giving
instructions to Major konómov, h could not hlp taking notic of th
soldir.
“Your xcllncy, hr ar two trophis,” said Dólokhov, pointing
to th Frnch sword and pouch. “I hav takn an officr prisonr. I
stoppd th company.” Dólokhov brathd havily from warinss and
spok in abrupt sntncs. “Th whol company can bar witnss. I bg
you will rmmbr this, your xcllncy!”
“All right, all right,” rplid th commandr, and turnd to Major
konómov.
But Dólokhov did not go away; h untid th handkrchif around his
had, pulld it off, and showd th blood congald on his hair.
“A bayont wound. I rmaind at th front. Rmmbr, your
xcllncy!”
Túshin’s battry had bn forgottn and only at th vry nd of th
action did Princ Bagratión, still haring th cannonad in th cntr,
snd his ordrly staff officr, and latr Princ Andrw also, to ordr
th battry to rtir as quickly as possibl. Whn th supports attachd
to Túshin’s battry had bn movd away in th middl of th action
by somon’s ordr, th battry had continud firing and was only not
capturd by th Frnch bcaus th nmy could not surmis that anyon
could hav th ffrontry to continu firing from four quit undfndd
guns. On th contrary, th nrgtic action of that battry ld th
Frnch to suppos that hr—in th cntr—th main Russian forcs
wr concntratd. Twic thy had attmptd to attack this point, but on
ach occasion had bn drivn back by grapshot from th four isolatd
guns on th hillock.
Soon aftr Princ Bagratión had lft him, Túshin had succdd in
stting fir to Schön Grabrn.
“Look at thm scurrying! It’s burning! Just s th smok! Fin!
Grand! Look at th smok, th smok!” xclaimd th artillrymn,
brightning up.
All th guns, without waiting for ordrs, wr bing fird in th
dirction of th conflagration. As if urging ach othr on, th soldirs
crid at ach shot: “Fin! That’s good! Look at it... Grand!” Th
fir, fannd by th brz, was rapidly sprading. Th Frnch columns
that had advancd byond th villag wnt back; but as though in rvng
for this failur, th nmy placd tn guns to th right of th villag
and bgan firing thm at Túshin’s battry.
In thir childlik gl, arousd by th fir and thir luck in
succssfully cannonading th Frnch, our artillrymn only noticd this
battry whn two balls, and thn four mor, fll among our guns, on
knocking ovr two horss and anothr taring off a munition-wagon
drivr’s lg. Thir spirits onc rousd wr, howvr, not diminishd,
but only changd charactr. Th horss wr rplacd by othrs from a
rsrv gun carriag, th woundd wr carrid away, and th four guns
wr turnd against th tn-gun battry. Túshin’s companion officr
had bn killd at th bginning of th ngagmnt and within an hour
svntn of th forty mn of th guns’ crws had bn disabld, but
th artillrymn wr still as mrry and livly as vr. Twic thy
noticd th Frnch apparing blow thm, and thn thy fird grapshot
at thm.
Littl Túshin, moving fbly and awkwardly, kpt tlling his ordrly to
“rfill my pip for that on!” and thn, scattring sparks from it,
ran forward shading his ys with his small hand to look at th Frnch.
“Smack at ‘m, lads!” h kpt saying, sizing th guns by th
whls and working th scrws himslf.
Amid th smok, dafnd by th incssant rports which always mad him
jump, Túshin not taking his pip from his mouth ran from gun to gun,
now aiming, now counting th chargs, now giving ordrs about rplacing
dad or woundd horss and harnssing frsh ons, and shouting in his
fbl voic, so high pitchd and irrsolut. His fac grw mor and
mor animatd. Only whn a man was killd or woundd did h frown and
turn away from th sight, shouting angrily at th mn who, as is always
th cas, hsitatd about lifting th injurd or dad. Th soldirs,
for th most part handsom fllows and, as is always th cas in an
artillry company, a had and shouldrs tallr and twic as broad
as thir officr—all lookd at thir commandr lik childrn in an
mbarrassing situation, and th xprssion on his fac was invariably
rflctd on thirs.
Owing to th trribl uproar and th ncssity for concntration and
activity, Túshin did not xprinc th slightst unplasant sns of
far, and th thought that h might b killd or badly woundd nvr
occurrd to him. On th contrary, h bcam mor and mor latd. It
smd to him that it was a vry long tim ago, almost a day, sinc h
had first sn th nmy and fird th first shot, and that th cornr
of th fild h stood on was wll-known and familiar ground. Though h
thought of vrything, considrd vrything, and did vrything th
bst of officrs could do in his position, h was in a stat akin to
fvrish dlirium or drunknnss.
From th dafning sounds of his own guns around him, th whistl and
thud of th nmy’s cannon balls, from th flushd and prspiring
facs of th crw bustling round th guns, from th sight of th blood
of mn and horss, from th littl puffs of smok on th nmy’s sid
(always followd by a ball flying past and striking th arth, a man, a
gun, a hors), from th sight of all ths things a fantastic world of
his own had takn possssion of his brain and at that momnt affordd
him plasur. Th nmy’s guns wr in his fancy not guns but pips
from which occasional puffs wr blown by an invisibl smokr.
“Thr... h’s puffing again,” muttrd Túshin to himslf, as a
small cloud ros from th hill and was born in a strak to th lft by
th wind.
“Now look out for th ball... w’ll throw it back.”
“What do you want, your honor?” askd an artillryman, standing
clos by, who hard him muttring.
“Nothing... only a shll...” h answrd.
“Com along, our Matvvna!” h said to himslf. “Matvvna” *
was th nam his fancy gav to th farthst gun of th battry, which
was larg and of an old pattrn. Th Frnch swarming round thir guns
smd to him lik ants. In that world, th handsom drunkard Numbr On
of th scond gun’s crw was “uncl”; Túshin lookd at him mor
oftn than at anyon ls and took dlight in his vry movmnt.
Th sound of musktry at th foot of th hill, now diminishing, now
incrasing, smd lik somon’s brathing. H listnd intntly to
th bb and flow of ths sounds.
    * Daughtr of Matthw.
“Ah! Brathing again, brathing!” h muttrd to himslf.
H imagind himslf as an normously tall, powrful man who was throwing
cannon balls at th Frnch with both hands.
“Now thn, Matvvna, dar old lady, don’t lt m down!” h was
saying as h movd from th gun, whn a strang, unfamiliar voic calld
abov his had: “Captain Túshin! Captain!”
Túshin turnd round in dismay. It was th staff officr who had turnd
him out of th booth at Grunth. H was shouting in a gasping voic:
“Ar you mad? You hav twic bn ordrd to rtrat, and you...”
“Why ar thy down on m?” thought Túshin, looking in alarm at his
suprior.
“I... don’t...” h muttrd, holding up two fingrs to his cap.
“I...”
But th staff officr did not finish what h wantd to say. A cannon
ball, flying clos to him, causd him to duck and bnd ovr his hors.
H pausd, and just as h was about to say somthing mor, anothr ball
stoppd him. H turnd his hors and gallopd off.
“Rtir! All to rtir!” h shoutd from a distanc.
Th soldirs laughd. A momnt latr, an adjutant arrivd with th sam
ordr.
It was Princ Andrw. Th first thing h saw on riding up to th spac
whr Túshin’s guns wr stationd was an unharnssd hors with a
brokn lg, that lay scraming pitously bsid th harnssd horss.
Blood was gushing from its lg as from a spring. Among th limbrs lay
svral dad mn. On ball aftr anothr passd ovr as h approachd
and h flt a nrvous shuddr run down his spin. But th mr thought
of bing afraid rousd him again. “I cannot b afraid,” thought h,
and dismountd slowly among th guns. H dlivrd th ordr and did
not lav th battry. H dcidd to hav th guns rmovd from thir
positions and withdrawn in his prsnc. Togthr with Túshin, stpping
across th bodis and undr a trribl fir from th Frnch, h attndd
to th rmoval of th guns.
“A staff officr was hr a minut ago, but skippd off,” said an
artillryman to Princ Andrw. “Not lik your honor!”
Princ Andrw said nothing to Túshin. Thy wr both so busy as to sm
not to notic on anothr. Whn having limbrd up th only two cannon
that rmaind uninjurd out of th four, thy bgan moving down th hill
(on shattrd gun and on unicorn wr lft bhind), Princ Andrw rod
up to Túshin.
“Wll, till w mt again...” h said, holding out his hand to
Túshin.
“Good-by, my dar fllow,” said Túshin. “Dar soul! Good-by, my
dar fllow!” and for som unknown rason tars suddnly filld his
ys.
CHAPTR XXI
Th wind had falln and black clouds, mrging with th powdr smok,
hung low ovr th fild of battl on th horizon. It was growing
dark and th glow of two conflagrations was th mor conspicuous. Th
cannonad was dying down, but th rattl of musktry bhind and on th
right soundd oftnr and narr. As soon as Túshin with his guns,
continually driving round or coming upon woundd mn, was out of rang
of fir and had dscndd into th dip, h was mt by som of th staff,
among thm th staff officr and Zhrkóv, who had bn twic snt to
Túshin’s battry but had nvr rachd it. Intrrupting on
anothr, thy all gav, and transmittd, ordrs as to how to procd,
rprimanding and rproaching him. Túshin gav no ordrs, and,
silntly—faring to spak bcaus at vry word h flt rady to
wp without knowing why—rod bhind on his artillry nag. Though
th ordrs wr to abandon th woundd, many of thm draggd thmslvs
aftr troops and bggd for sats on th gun carriags. Th jaunty
infantry officr who just bfor th battl had rushd out of
Túshin’s wattl shd was laid, with a bullt in his stomach, on
“Matvvna’s” carriag. At th foot of th hill, a pal hussar
cadt, supporting on hand with th othr, cam up to Túshin and askd
for a sat.
“Captain, for God’s sak! I’v hurt my arm,” h said timidly.
“For God’s sak... I can’t walk. For God’s sak!”
It was plain that this cadt had alrady rpatdly askd for a lift and
bn rfusd. H askd in a hsitating, pitous voic.
“Tll thm to giv m a sat, for God’s sak!”
“Giv him a sat,” said Túshin. “Lay a cloak for him to sit on,
lad,” h said, addrssing his favorit soldir. “And whr is th
woundd officr?”
“H has bn st down. H did,” rplid somon.
“Hlp him up. Sit down, dar fllow, sit down! Sprad out th cloak,
Antónov.”
Th cadt was Rostóv. With on hand h supportd th othr; h was
pal and his jaw trmbld, shivring fvrishly. H was placd on
“Matvvna,” th gun from which thy had rmovd th dad officr.
Th cloak thy sprad undr him was wt with blood which staind his
brchs and arm.
“What, ar you woundd, my lad?” said Túshin, approaching th gun
on which Rostóv sat.
“No, it’s a sprain.”
“Thn what is this blood on th gun carriag?” inquird Túshin.
“It was th officr, your honor, staind it,” answrd th
artillryman, wiping away th blood with his coat slv, as if
apologizing for th stat of his gun.
It was all that thy could do to gt th guns up th ris aidd by th
infantry, and having rachd th villag of Gruntrsdorf thy haltd. It
had grown so dark that on could not distinguish th uniforms tn pacs
off, and th firing had bgun to subsid. Suddnly, nar by on th
right, shouting and firing wr again hard. Flashs of shot glamd in
th darknss. This was th last Frnch attack and was mt by soldirs
who had shltrd in th villag houss. Thy all rushd out of
th villag again, but Túshin’s guns could not mov, and th
artillrymn, Túshin, and th cadt xchangd silnt glancs as thy
awaitd thir fat. Th firing did down and soldirs, talking agrly,
stramd out of a sid strt.
“Not hurt, Ptróv?” askd on.
“W’v givn it ‘m hot, mat! Thy won’t mak anothr push
now,” said anothr.
“You couldn’t s a thing. How thy shot at thir own fllows!
Nothing could b sn. Pitch-dark, brothr! Isn’t thr somthing to
drink?”
Th Frnch had bn rpulsd for th last tim. And again and again in
th complt darknss Túshin’s guns movd forward, surroundd by th
humming infantry as by a fram.
In th darknss, it smd as though a gloomy unsn rivr was flowing
always in on dirction, humming with whisprs and talk and th sound of
hoofs and whls. Amid th gnral rumbl, th groans and voics of th
woundd wr mor distinctly hard than any othr sound in th darknss
of th night. Th gloom that nvlopd th army was filld with thir
groans, which smd to mlt into on with th darknss of th night.
Aftr a whil th moving mass bcam agitatd, somon rod past on
a whit hors followd by his suit, and said somthing in passing:
“What did h say? Whr to, now? Halt, is it? Did h thank us?” cam
agr qustions from all sids. Th whol moving mass bgan prssing
closr togthr and a rport sprad that thy wr ordrd to halt:
vidntly thos in front had haltd. All rmaind whr thy wr in th
middl of th muddy road.
Firs wr lightd and th talk bcam mor audibl. Captain Túshin,
having givn ordrs to his company, snt a soldir to find a drssing
station or a doctor for th cadt, and sat down by a bonfir th
soldirs had kindld on th road. Rostóv, too, draggd himslf to th
fir. From pain, cold, and damp, a fvrish shivring shook his whol
body. Drowsinss was irrsistibly mastring him, but h kpt awak by
an xcruciating pain in his arm, for which h could find no satisfactory
position. H kpt closing his ys and thn again looking at th fir,
which smd to him dazzlingly rd, and at th fbl, round-shouldrd
figur of Túshin who was sitting cross-lggd lik a Turk bsid him.
Túshin’s larg, kind, intllignt ys wr fixd with sympathy and
commisration on Rostóv, who saw that Túshin with his whol hart
wishd to hlp him but could not.
From all sids wr hard th footstps and talk of th infantry, who
wr walking, driving past, and sttling down all around. Th sound
of voics, th tramping ft, th horss’ hoofs moving in mud, th
crackling of wood firs nar and afar, mrgd into on trmulous rumbl.
It was no longr, as bfor, a dark, unsn rivr flowing through th
gloom, but a dark sa swlling and gradually subsiding aftr a storm.
Rostóv lookd at and listnd listlssly to what passd bfor and
around him. An infantryman cam to th fir, squattd on his hls, hld
his hands to th blaz, and turnd away his fac.
“You don’t mind your honor?” h askd Túshin. “I’v lost my
company, your honor. I don’t know whr... such bad luck!”
With th soldir, an infantry officr with a bandagd chk cam up to
th bonfir, and addrssing Túshin askd him to hav th guns movd a
trifl to lt a wagon go past. Aftr h had gon, two soldirs rushd to
th campfir. Thy wr quarrling and fighting dspratly, ach trying
to snatch from th othr a boot thy wr both holding on to.
“You pickd it up?... I dar say! You’r vry smart!” on of thm
shoutd hoarsly.
Thn a thin, pal soldir, his nck bandagd with a bloodstaind lg
band, cam up and in angry tons askd th artillrymn for watr.
“Must on di lik a dog?” said h.
Túshin told thm to giv th man som watr. Thn a chrful soldir
ran up, bgging a littl fir for th infantry.
“A nic littl hot torch for th infantry! Good luck to you, fllow
countrymn. Thanks for th fir—w’ll rturn it with intrst,”
said h, carrying away into th darknss a glowing stick.
Nxt cam four soldirs, carrying somthing havy on a cloak, and passd
by th fir. On of thm stumbld.
“Who th dvil has put th logs on th road?” snarld h.
“H’s dad—why carry him?” said anothr.
“Shut up!”
And thy disappard into th darknss with thir load.
“Still aching?” Túshin askd Rostóv in a whispr.
“Ys.”
“Your honor, you’r wantd by th gnral. H is in th hut hr,”
said a gunnr, coming up to Túshin.
“Coming, frind.”
Túshin ros and, buttoning his gratcoat and pulling it straight,
walkd away from th fir.
Not far from th artillry campfir, in a hut that had bn prpard
for him, Princ Bagratión sat at dinnr, talking with som commanding
officrs who had gathrd at his quartrs. Th littl old man with
th half-closd ys was thr grdily gnawing a mutton bon, and th
gnral who had srvd blamlssly for twnty-two yars, flushd by a
glass of vodka and th dinnr; and th staff officr with th signt
ring, and Zhrkóv, unasily glancing at thm all, and Princ Andrw,
pal, with comprssd lips and fvrishly glittring ys.
In a cornr of th hut stood a standard capturd from th Frnch, and
th accountant with th naïv fac was fling its txtur, shaking his
had in prplxity—prhaps bcaus th bannr rally intrstd him,
prhaps bcaus it was hard for him, hungry as h was, to look on at
a dinnr whr thr was no plac for him. In th nxt hut thr was a
Frnch colonl who had bn takn prisonr by our dragoons. Our officrs
wr flocking in to look at him. Princ Bagratión was thanking th
individual commandrs and inquiring into dtails of th action and our
losss. Th gnral whos rgimnt had bn inspctd at Braunau was
informing th princ that as soon as th action bgan h had withdrawn
from th wood, mustrd th mn who wr woodcutting, and, allowing th
Frnch to pass him, had mad a bayont charg with two battalions and
had brokn up th Frnch troops.
“Whn I saw, your xcllncy, that thir first battalion was
disorganizd, I stoppd in th road and thought: ‘I’ll lt thm
com on and will mt thm with th fir of th whol battalion’—and
that’s what I did.”
Th gnral had so wishd to do this and was so sorry h had not managd
to do it that it smd to him as if it had rally happnd. Prhaps
it might rally hav bn so? Could on possibly mak out amid all that
confusion what did or did not happn?
“By th way, your xcllncy, I should inform you,” h
continud—rmmbring Dólokhov’s convrsation with Kutúzov and his
last intrviw with th gntlman-rankr—“that Privat Dólokhov,
who was rducd to th ranks, took a Frnch officr prisonr in my
prsnc and particularly distinguishd himslf.”
“I saw th Pávlograd hussars attack thr, your xcllncy,” chimd
in Zhrkóv, looking unasily around. H had not sn th hussars all
that day, but had hard about thm from an infantry officr. “Thy
brok up two squars, your xcllncy.”
Svral of thos prsnt smild at Zhrkóv’s words, xpcting on of
his usual joks, but noticing that what h was saying rdoundd to
th glory of our arms and of th day’s work, thy assumd a srious
xprssion, though many of thm knw that what h was saying was a li
dvoid of any foundation. Princ Bagratión turnd to th old colonl:
“Gntlmn, I thank you all; all arms hav bhavd hroically:
infantry, cavalry, and artillry. How was it that two guns wr
abandond in th cntr?” h inquird, sarching with his ys for
somon. (Princ Bagratión did not ask about th guns on th lft
flank; h knw that all th guns thr had bn abandond at th vry
bginning of th action.) “I think I snt you?” h addd, turning to
th staff officr on duty.
“On was damagd,” answrd th staff officr, “and th othr I
can’t undrstand. I was thr all th tim giving ordrs and had only
just lft.... It is tru that it was hot thr,” h addd, modstly.
Somon mntiond that Captain Túshin was bivouacking clos to th
villag and had alrady bn snt for.
“Oh, but you wr thr?” said Princ Bagratión, addrssing Princ
Andrw.
“Of cours, w only just missd on anothr,” said th staff
officr, with a smil to Bolkónski.
“I had not th plasur of sing you,” said Princ Andrw, coldly
and abruptly.
All wr silnt. Túshin appard at th thrshold and mad his way
timidly from bhind th backs of th gnrals. As h stppd past th
gnrals in th crowdd hut, fling mbarrassd as h always was by th
sight of his supriors, h did not notic th staff of th bannr and
stumbld ovr it. Svral of thos prsnt laughd.
“How was it a gun was abandond?” askd Bagratión, frowning, not so
much at th captain as at thos who wr laughing, among whom Zhrkóv
laughd loudst.
Only now, whn h was confrontd by th strn authoritis, did his guilt
and th disgrac of having lost two guns and yt rmaining aliv prsnt
thmslvs to Túshin in all thir horror. H had bn so xcitd that
h had not thought about it until that momnt. Th officrs’ laughtr
confusd him still mor. H stood bfor Bagratión with his lowr
jaw trmbling and was hardly abl to muttr: “I don’t know... your
xcllncy... I had no mn... your xcllncy.”
“You might hav takn som from th covring troops.”
Túshin did not say that thr wr no covring troops, though that
was prfctly tru. H was afraid of gtting som othr officr into
troubl, and silntly fixd his ys on Bagratión as a schoolboy who
has blundrd looks at an xaminr.
Th silnc lastd som tim. Princ Bagratión, apparntly not wishing
to b svr, found nothing to say; th othrs did not vntur to
intrvn. Princ Andrw lookd at Túshin from undr his brows and his
fingrs twitchd nrvously.
“Your xcllncy!” Princ Andrw brok th silnc with his abrupt
voic, “you wr plasd to snd m to Captain Túshin’s battry. I
wnt thr and found two thirds of th mn and horss knockd out, two
guns smashd, and no supports at all.”
Princ Bagratión and Túshin lookd with qual intntnss at
Bolkónski, who spok with supprssd agitation.
“And, if your xcllncy will allow m to xprss my opinion,” h
continud, “w ow today’s succss chifly to th action of that
battry and th hroic nduranc of Captain Túshin and his company,”
and without awaiting a rply, Princ Andrw ros and lft th tabl.
Princ Bagratión lookd at Túshin, vidntly rluctant to show
distrust in Bolkónski’s mphatic opinion yt not fling abl fully
to crdit it, bnt his had, and told Túshin that h could go. Princ
Andrw wnt out with him.
“Thank you; you savd m, my dar fllow!” said Túshin.
Princ Andrw gav him a look, but said nothing and wnt away. H flt
sad and dprssd. It was all so strang, so unlik what h had hopd.
“Who ar thy? Why ar thy hr? What do thy want? And whn will
all this nd?” thought Rostóv, looking at th changing shadows bfor
him. Th pain in his arm bcam mor and mor intns. Irrsistibl
drowsinss ovrpowrd him, rd rings dancd bfor his ys, and th
imprssion of thos voics and facs and a sns of lonlinss mrgd
with th physical pain. It was thy, ths soldirs—woundd and
unwoundd—it was thy who wr crushing, wighing down, and twisting
th sinws and scorching th flsh of his spraind arm and shouldr. To
rid himslf of thm h closd his ys.
For a momnt h dozd, but in that short intrval innumrabl things
appard to him in a dram: his mothr and hr larg whit hand,
Sónya’s thin littl shouldrs, Natásha’s ys and laughtr,
Dnísov with his voic and mustach, and Tlyánin and all that affair
with Tlyánin and Bogdánich. That affair was th sam thing as this
soldir with th harsh voic, and it was that affair and this soldir
that wr so agonizingly, incssantly pulling and prssing his arm and
always dragging it in on dirction. H trid to gt away from thm, but
thy would not for an instant lt his shouldr mov a hair’s bradth.
It would not ach—it would b wll—if only thy did not pull it, but
it was impossibl to gt rid of thm.
H opnd his ys and lookd up. Th black canopy of night hung lss
than a yard abov th glow of th charcoal. Flaks of falling snow wr
fluttring in that light. Túshin had not rturnd, th doctor had not
com. H was alon now, xcpt for a soldir who was sitting nakd at
th othr sid of th fir, warming his thin yllow body.
“Nobody wants m!” thought Rostóv. “Thr is no on to hlp m or
pity m. Yt I was onc at hom, strong, happy, and lovd.” H sighd
and, doing so, groand involuntarily.
“h, is anything hurting you?” askd th soldir, shaking his shirt
out ovr th fir, and not waiting for an answr h gav a grunt and
addd: “What a lot of mn hav bn crippld today—frightful!”
Rostóv did not listn to th soldir. H lookd at th snowflaks
fluttring abov th fir and rmmbrd a Russian wintr at his warm,
bright hom, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sligh, his
halthy body, and all th affction and car of his family. “And why
did I com hr?” h wondrd.
Nxt day th Frnch army did not rnw thir attack, and th rmnant of
Bagratión’s dtachmnt was runitd to Kutúzov’s army.
BOOK THR: 1805
CHAPTR I
Princ Vasíli was not a man who dlibratly thought out his plans.
Still lss did h think of injuring anyon for his own advantag. H
was mrly a man of th world who had got on and to whom gtting on had
bcom a habit. Schms and dvics for which h nvr rightly accountd
to himslf, but which formd th whol intrst of his lif,
wr constantly shaping thmslvs in his mind, arising from th
circumstancs and prsons h mt. Of ths plans h had not mrly on
or two in his had but dozns, som only bginning to form thmslvs,
som approaching achivmnt, and som in cours of disintgration. H
did not, for instanc, say to himslf: “This man now has influnc, I
must gain his confidnc and frindship and through him obtain a spcial
grant.” Nor did h say to himslf: “Pirr is a rich man, I must
ntic him to marry my daughtr and lnd m th forty thousand rubls
I nd.” But whn h cam across a man of position his instinct
immdiatly told him that this man could b usful, and without any
prmditation Princ Vasíli took th first opportunity to gain his
confidnc, flattr him, bcom intimat with him, and finally mak his
rqust.
H had Pirr at hand in Moscow and procurd for him an appointmnt as
Gntlman of th Bdchambr, which at that tim confrrd th status of
Councilor of Stat, and insistd on th young man accompanying him to
Ptrsburg and staying at his hous. With apparnt absnt-minddnss,
yt with unhsitating assuranc that h was doing th right thing,
Princ Vasíli did vrything to gt Pirr to marry his daughtr. Had
h thought out his plans bforhand h could not hav bn so natural
and shown such unaffctd familiarity in intrcours with vrybody both
abov and blow him in social standing. Somthing always drw him toward
thos richr and mor powrful than himslf and h had rar skill in
sizing th most opportun momnt for making us of popl.
Pirr, on unxpctdly bcoming Count Bzúkhov and a rich man, flt
himslf aftr his rcnt lonlinss and frdom from cars so bst and
proccupid that only in bd was h abl to b by himslf. H had to
sign paprs, to prsnt himslf at govrnmnt offics, th purpos of
which was not clar to him, to qustion his chif stward, to visit his
stat nar Moscow, and to rciv many popl who formrly did not
vn wish to know of his xistnc but would now hav bn offndd
and grivd had h chosn not to s thm. Ths diffrnt
popl—businssmn, rlations, and acquaintancs alik—wr all
disposd to trat th young hir in th most frindly and flattring
mannr: thy wr all vidntly firmly convincd of Pirr’s nobl
qualitis. H was always haring such words as: “With your rmarkabl
kindnss,” or, “With your xcllnt hart,” “You ar yourslf so
honorabl, Count,” or, “Wr h as clvr as you,” and so on,
till h bgan sincrly to bliv in his own xcptional kindnss and
xtraordinary intllignc, th mor so as in th dpth of his hart it
had always smd to him that h rally was vry kind and intllignt.
vn popl who had formrly bn spitful toward him and vidntly
unfrindly now bcam gntl and affctionat. Th angry ldst
princss, with th long waist and hair plastrd down lik a doll’s,
had com into Pirr’s room aftr th funral. With drooping ys
and frqunt blushs sh told him sh was vry sorry about thir past
misundrstandings and did not now fl sh had a right to ask him for
anything, xcpt only for prmission, aftr th blow sh had rcivd,
to rmain for a fw wks longr in th hous sh so lovd and whr
sh had sacrificd so much. Sh could not rfrain from wping at ths
words. Touchd that this statusqu princss could so chang, Pirr
took hr hand and bggd hr forgivnss, without knowing what for.
From that day th ldst princss quit changd toward Pirr and bgan
knitting a stripd scarf for him.
“Do this for my sak, mon chr; aftr all, sh had to put up with a
grat dal from th dcasd,” said Princ Vasíli to him, handing him
a dd to sign for th princss’ bnfit.
Princ Vasíli had com to th conclusion that it was ncssary to throw
this bon—a bill for thirty thousand rubls—to th poor princss
that it might not occur to hr to spak of his shar in th affair of
th inlaid portfolio. Pirr signd th dd and aftr that th princss
grw still kindr. Th youngr sistrs also bcam affctionat to him,
spcially th youngst, th prtty on with th mol, who oftn mad
him fl confusd by hr smils and hr own confusion whn mting him.
It smd so natural to Pirr that vryon should lik him, and it
would hav smd so unnatural had anyon dislikd him, that h could
not but bliv in th sincrity of thos around him. Bsids, h had
no tim to ask himslf whthr ths popl wr sincr or not. H
was always busy and always flt in a stat of mild and chrful
intoxication. H flt as though h wr th cntr of som important and
gnral movmnt; that somthing was constantly xpctd of him, that if
h did not do it h would griv and disappoint many popl, but if h
did this and that, all would b wll; and h did what was dmandd of
him, but still that happy rsult always rmaind in th futur.
Mor than anyon ls, Princ Vasíli took possssion of Pirr’s
affairs and of Pirr himslf in thos arly days. From th dath of
Count Bzúkhov h did not lt go his hold of th lad. H had th air of
a man opprssd by businss, wary and suffring, who yt would not, for
pity’s sak, lav this hlplss youth who, aftr all, was th son of
his old frind and th possssor of such normous walth, to th capric
of fat and th dsigns of rogus. During th fw days h spnt in
Moscow aftr th dath of Count Bzúkhov, h would call Pirr, or
go to him himslf, and tll him what ought to b don in a ton of
warinss and assuranc, as if h wr adding vry tim: “You know
I am ovrwhlmd with businss and it is purly out of charity that
I troubl myslf about you, and you also know quit wll that what I
propos is th only thing possibl.”
“Wll, my dar fllow, tomorrow w ar off at last,” said Princ
Vasíli on day, closing his ys and fingring Pirr’s lbow,
spaking as if h wr saying somthing which had long sinc bn agrd
upon and could not now b altrd. “W start tomorrow and I’m giving
you a plac in my carriag. I am vry glad. All our important businss
hr is now sttld, and I ought to hav bn off long ago. Hr is
somthing I hav rcivd from th chancllor. I askd him for you, and
you hav bn ntrd in th diplomatic corps and mad a Gntlman of
th Bdchambr. Th diplomatic carr now lis opn bfor you.”
Notwithstanding th ton of warid assuranc with which ths words
wr pronouncd, Pirr, who had so long bn considring his carr,
wishd to mak som suggstion. But Princ Vasíli intrruptd him in
th spcial dp cooing ton, prcluding th possibility of intrrupting
his spch, which h usd in xtrm cass whn spcial prsuasion was
ndd.
“Mais, mon chr, I did this for my own sak, to satisfy my conscinc,
and thr is nothing to thank m for. No on has vr complaind yt of
bing too much lovd; and bsids, you ar fr, you could throw it
up tomorrow. But you will s vrything for yourslf whn you gt to
Ptrsburg. It is high tim for you to gt away from ths trribl
rcollctions.” Princ Vasíli sighd. “Ys, ys, my boy. And my
valt can go in your carriag. Ah! I was narly forgtting,” h addd.
“You know, mon chr, your fathr and I had som accounts to sttl, so
I hav rcivd what was du from th Ryazán stat and will kp it;
you won’t rquir it. W’ll go into th accounts latr.”
By “what was du from th Ryazán stat” Princ Vasíli mant
svral thousand rubls quitrnt rcivd from Pirr’s pasants,
which th princ had rtaind for himslf.
In Ptrsburg, as in Moscow, Pirr found th sam atmosphr of
gntlnss and affction. H could not rfus th post, or rathr th
rank (for h did nothing), that Princ Vasíli had procurd for him,
and acquaintancs, invitations, and social occupations wr so numrous
that, vn mor than in Moscow, h flt a sns of bwildrmnt, bustl,
and continual xpctation of som good, always in front of him but nvr
attaind.
Of his formr bachlor acquaintancs many wr no longr in Ptrsburg.
Th Guards had gon to th front; Dólokhov had bn rducd to th
ranks; Anatol was in th army somwhr in th provincs; Princ Andrw
was abroad; so Pirr had not th opportunity to spnd his nights as h
usd to lik to spnd thm, or to opn his mind by intimat talks with
a frind oldr than himslf and whom h rspctd. His whol tim
was takn up with dinnrs and balls and was spnt chifly at Princ
Vasíli’s hous in th company of th stout princss, his wif, and
his bautiful daughtr Hlèn.
Lik th othrs, Anna Pávlovna Schrr showd Pirr th chang of
attitud toward him that had takn plac in socity.
Formrly in Anna Pávlovna’s prsnc, Pirr had always flt that
what h was saying was out of plac, tactlss and unsuitabl, that
rmarks which smd to him clvr whil thy formd in his mind bcam
foolish as soon as h uttrd thm, whil on th contrary Hippolyt’s
stupidst rmarks cam out clvr and apt. Now vrything Pirr said
was charmant. vn if Anna Pávlovna did not say so, h could s that
sh wishd to and only rfraind out of rgard for his modsty.
In th bginning of th wintr of 1805-6 Pirr rcivd on of Anna
Pávlovna’s usual pink nots with an invitation to which was addd:
“You will find th bautiful Hlèn hr, whom it is always
dlightful to s.”
Whn h rad that sntnc, Pirr flt for th first tim that som
link which othr popl rcognizd had grown up btwn himslf and
Hlèn, and that thought both alarmd him, as if som obligation wr
bing imposd on him which h could not fulfill, and plasd him as an
ntrtaining supposition.
Anna Pávlovna’s “At Hom” was lik th formr on, only th
novlty sh offrd hr gusts this tim was not Mortmart, but a
diplomatist frsh from Brlin with th vry latst dtails of th
mpror Alxandr’s visit to Potsdam, and of how th two august
frinds had pldgd thmslvs in an indissolubl allianc to uphold
th caus of justic against th nmy of th human rac. Anna Pávlovna
rcivd Pirr with a shad of mlancholy, vidntly rlating to th
young man’s rcnt loss by th dath of Count Bzúkhov (vryon
constantly considrd it a duty to assur Pirr that h was gratly
afflictd by th dath of th fathr h had hardly known), and hr
mlancholy was just lik th august mlancholy sh showd at th mntion
of hr most august Majsty th mprss Márya Fëdorovna. Pirr flt
flattrd by this. Anna Pávlovna arrangd th diffrnt groups in hr
drawing room with hr habitual skill. Th larg group, in which wr
Princ Vasíli and th gnrals, had th bnfit of th diplomat.
Anothr group was at th ta tabl. Pirr wishd to join th formr,
but Anna Pávlovna—who was in th xcitd condition of a commandr on
a battlfild to whom thousands of nw and brilliant idas occur which
thr is hardly tim to put in action—sing Pirr, touchd his
slv with hr fingr, saying:
“Wait a bit, I hav somthing in viw for you this vning.”
(Sh glancd at Hlèn and smild at hr.) “My dar Hlèn, b
charitabl to my poor aunt who adors you. Go and kp hr company for
tn minuts. And that it will not b too dull, hr is th dar count
who will not rfus to accompany you.”
Th bauty wnt to th aunt, but Anna Pávlovna dtaind Pirr, looking
as if sh had to giv som final ncssary instructions.
“Isn’t sh xquisit?” sh said to Pirr, pointing to th statly
bauty as sh glidd away. “And how sh carris hrslf! For so young
a girl, such tact, such mastrly prfction of mannr! It coms from
hr hart. Happy th man who wins hr! With hr th last worldly of mn
would occupy a most brilliant position in socity. Don’t you think so?
I only wantd to know your opinion,” and Anna Pávlovna lt Pirr go.
Pirr, in rply, sincrly agrd with hr as to Hlèn’s
prfction of mannr. If h vr thought of Hlèn, it was just of
hr bauty and hr rmarkabl skill in apparing silntly dignifid in
socity.
Th old aunt rcivd th two young popl in hr cornr, but smd
dsirous of hiding hr adoration for Hlèn and inclind rathr
to show hr far of Anna Pávlovna. Sh lookd at hr nic, as if
inquiring what sh was to do with ths popl. On laving thm, Anna
Pávlovna again touchd Pirr’s slv, saying: “I hop you won’t
say that it is dull in my hous again,” and sh glancd at Hlèn.
Hlèn smild, with a look implying that sh did not admit th
possibility of anyon sing hr without bing nchantd. Th aunt
coughd, swallowd, and said in Frnch that sh was vry plasd to s
Hlèn, thn sh turnd to Pirr with th sam words of wlcom
and th sam look. In th middl of a dull and halting convrsation,
Hlèn turnd to Pirr with th bautiful bright smil that sh gav
to vryon. Pirr was so usd to that smil, and it had so littl
maning for him, that h paid no attntion to it. Th aunt was just
spaking of a collction of snuffboxs that had blongd to Pirr’s
fathr, Count Bzúkhov, and showd thm hr own box. Princss Hlèn
askd to s th portrait of th aunt’s husband on th box lid.
“That is probably th work of Vinss,” said Pirr, mntioning
a clbratd miniaturist, and h land ovr th tabl to tak th
snuffbox whil trying to har what was bing said at th othr tabl.
H half ros, maning to go round, but th aunt handd him th snuffbox,
passing it across Hlèn’s back. Hlèn stoopd forward to mak
room, and lookd round with a smil. Sh was, as always at vning
partis, waring a drss such as was thn fashionabl, cut vry low at
front and back. Hr bust, which had always smd lik marbl to Pirr,
was so clos to him that his shortsightd ys could not but prciv
th living charm of hr nck and shouldrs, so nar to his lips that
h nd only hav bnt his had a littl to hav touchd thm. H was
conscious of th warmth of hr body, th scnt of prfum, and th
craking of hr corst as sh movd. H did not s hr marbl bauty
forming a complt whol with hr drss, but all th charm of hr body
only covrd by hr garmnts. And having onc sn this h could not
hlp bing awar of it, just as w cannot rnw an illusion w hav onc
sn through.
“So you hav nvr noticd bfor how bautiful I am?” Hlèn
smd to say. “You had not noticd that I am a woman? Ys, I am a
woman who may blong to anyon—to you too,” said hr glanc. And at
that momnt Pirr flt that Hlèn not only could, but must, b his
wif, and that it could not b othrwis.
H knw this at that momnt as surly as if h had bn standing at th
altar with hr. How and whn this would b h did not know, h did not
vn know if it would b a good thing (h vn flt, h knw not why,
that it would b a bad thing), but h knw it would happn.
Pirr droppd his ys, liftd thm again, and wishd onc mor to s
hr as a distant bauty far rmovd from him, as h had sn hr vry
day until thn, but h could no longr do it. H could not, any mor
than a man who has bn looking at a tuft of stpp grass through th
mist and taking it for a tr can again tak it for a tr aftr h has
onc rcognizd it to b a tuft of grass. Sh was trribly clos to him.
Sh alrady had powr ovr him, and btwn thm thr was no longr any
barrir xcpt th barrir of his own will.
“Wll, I will lav you in your littl cornr,” cam Anna
Pávlovna’s voic, “I s you ar all right thr.”
And Pirr, anxiously trying to rmmbr whthr h had don anything
rprhnsibl, lookd round with a blush. It smd to him that vryon
knw what had happnd to him as h knw it himslf.
A littl latr whn h wnt up to th larg circl, Anna Pávlovna said
to him: “I har you ar rfitting your Ptrsburg hous?”
This was tru. Th architct had told him that it was ncssary, and
Pirr, without knowing why, was having his normous Ptrsburg hous
don up.
“That’s a good thing, but don’t mov from Princ Vasíli’s. It
is good to hav a frind lik th princ,” sh said, smiling at Princ
Vasíli. “I know somthing about that. Don’t I? And you ar still so
young. You nd advic. Don’t b angry with m for xrcising an old
woman’s privilg.”
Sh pausd, as womn always do, xpcting somthing aftr thy hav
mntiond thir ag. “If you marry it will b a diffrnt thing,”
sh continud, uniting thm both in on glanc. Pirr did not look at
Hlèn nor sh at him. But sh was just as trribly clos to him. H
muttrd somthing and colord.
Whn h got hom h could not slp for a long tim for thinking of what
had happnd. What had happnd? Nothing. H had mrly undrstood that
th woman h had known as a child, of whom whn hr bauty was mntiond
h had said absnt-minddly: “Ys, sh’s good looking,” h had
undrstood that this woman might blong to him.
“But sh’s stupid. I hav myslf said sh is stupid,” h thought.
“Thr is somthing nasty, somthing wrong, in th fling sh xcits
in m. I hav bn told that hr brothr Anatol was in lov with hr
and sh with him, that thr was quit a scandal and that that’s why
h was snt away. Hippolyt is hr brothr... Princ Vasíli is hr
fathr... It’s bad....” h rflctd, but whil h was thinking this
(th rflction was still incomplt), h caught himslf smiling and was
conscious that anothr lin of thought had sprung up, and whil thinking
of hr worthlssnss h was also draming of how sh would b his
wif, how sh would lov him bcom quit diffrnt, and how all h had
thought and hard of hr might b fals. And h again saw hr not as th
daughtr of Princ Vasíli, but visualizd hr whol body only vild
by its gray drss. “But no! Why did this thought nvr occur to m
bfor?” and again h told himslf that it was impossibl, that thr
would b somthing unnatural, and as it smd to him dishonorabl, in
this marriag. H rcalld hr formr words and looks and th words
and looks of thos who had sn thm togthr. H rcalld Anna
Pávlovna’s words and looks whn sh spok to him about his hous,
rcalld thousands of such hints from Princ Vasíli and othrs, and was
sizd by trror lst h had alrady, in som way, bound himslf to do
somthing that was vidntly wrong and that h ought not to do. But at
th vry tim h was xprssing this conviction to himslf, in anothr
part of his mind hr imag ros in all its womanly bauty.
CHAPTR II
In Novmbr, 1805, Princ Vasíli had to go on a tour of inspction
in four diffrnt provincs. H had arrangd this for himslf so as to
visit his nglctd stats at th sam tim and pick up his son Anatol
whr his rgimnt was stationd, and tak him to visit Princ Nicholas
Bolkónski in ordr to arrang a match for him with th daughtr of that
rich old man. But bfor laving hom and undrtaking ths nw affairs,
Princ Vasíli had to sttl mattrs with Pirr, who, it is tru, had
lattrly spnt whol days at hom, that is, in Princ Vasíli’s hous
whr h was staying, and had bn absurd, xcitd, and foolish in
Hlèn’s prsnc (as a lovr should b), but had not yt proposd
to hr.
“This is all vry fin, but things must b sttld,” said Princ
Vasíli to himslf, with a sorrowful sigh, on morning, fling that
Pirr who was undr such obligations to him (“But nvr mind that”)
was not bhaving vry wll in this mattr. “Youth, frivolity... wll,
God b with him,” thought h, rlishing his own goodnss of hart,
“but it must b brought to a had. Th day aftr tomorrow will b
Lëlya’s nam day. I will invit two or thr popl, and if h dos
not undrstand what h ought to do thn it will b my affair—ys, my
affair. I am hr fathr.”
Six wks aftr Anna Pávlovna’s “At Hom” and aftr th slplss
night whn h had dcidd that to marry Hlèn would b a calamity and
that h ought to avoid hr and go away, Pirr, dspit that dcision,
had not lft Princ Vasíli’s and flt with trror that in popl’s
ys h was vry day mor and mor connctd with hr, that it was
impossibl for him to rturn to his formr concption of hr, that h
could not brak away from hr, and that though it would b a trribl
thing h would hav to unit his fat with hrs. H might prhaps hav
bn abl to fr himslf but that Princ Vasíli (who had rarly bfor
givn rcptions) now hardly lt a day go by without having an vning
party at which Pirr had to b prsnt unlss h wishd to spoil
th gnral plasur and disappoint vryon’s xpctation. Princ
Vasíli, in th rar momnts whn h was at hom, would tak Pirr’s
hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absnt-minddly hold out his
wrinkld, clan-shavn chk for Pirr to kiss and would say: “Till
tomorrow,” or, “B in to dinnr or I shall not s you,” or, “I
am staying in for your sak,” and so on. And though Princ Vasíli,
whn h stayd in (as h said) for Pirr’s sak, hardly xchangd a
coupl of words with him, Pirr flt unabl to disappoint him.
vry day h said to himslf on and th sam thing: “It is tim I
undrstood hr and mad up my mind what sh rally is. Was I mistakn
bfor, or am I mistakn now? No, sh is not stupid, sh is an xcllnt
girl,” h somtims said to himslf “sh nvr maks a mistak,
nvr says anything stupid. Sh says littl, but what sh dos say is
always clar and simpl, so sh is not stupid. Sh nvr was abashd and
is not abashd now, so sh cannot b a bad woman!” H had oftn bgun
to mak rflctions or think aloud in hr company, and sh had always
answrd him ithr by a brif but appropriat rmark—showing that it
did not intrst hr—or by a silnt look and smil which mor palpably
than anything ls showd Pirr hr supriority. Sh was right in
rgarding all argumnts as nonsns in comparison with that smil.
Sh always addrssd him with a radiantly confiding smil mant for him
alon, in which thr was somthing mor significant than in th gnral
smil that usually brightnd hr fac. Pirr knw that vryon was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a crtain lin, and h knw that
soonr or latr h would stp across it, but an incomprhnsibl trror
sizd him at th thought of that dradful stp. A thousand tims during
that month and a half whil h flt himslf drawn narr and narr to
that dradful abyss, Pirr said to himslf: “What am I doing? I nd
rsolution. Can it b that I hav non?”
H wishd to tak a dcision, but flt with dismay that in this mattr
h lackd that strngth of will which h had known in himslf and rally
possssd. Pirr was on of thos who ar only strong whn thy fl
thmslvs quit innocnt, and sinc that day whn h was ovrpowrd
by a fling of dsir whil stooping ovr th snuffbox at Anna
Pávlovna’s, an unacknowldgd sns of th guilt of that dsir
paralyzd his will.
On Hlèn’s nam day, a small party of just thir own popl—as
his wif said—mt for suppr at Princ Vasíli’s. All ths frinds
and rlations had bn givn to undrstand that th fat of th young
girl would b dcidd that vning. Th visitors wr satd at suppr.
Princss Kurágina, a portly imposing woman who had onc bn handsom,
was sitting at th had of th tabl. On ithr sid of hr sat th
mor important gusts—an old gnral and his wif, and Anna Pávlovna
Schrr. At th othr nd sat th youngr and lss important gusts,
and thr too sat th mmbrs of th family, and Pirr and Hlèn,
sid by sid. Princ Vasíli was not having any suppr: h wnt round
th tabl in a mrry mood, sitting down now by on, now by anothr, of
th gusts. To ach of thm h mad som carlss and agrabl rmark
xcpt to Pirr and Hlèn, whos prsnc h smd not to notic.
H nlivnd th whol party. Th wax candls burnd brightly, th
silvr and crystal glamd, so did th ladis’ toilts and th gold
and silvr of th mn’s paults; srvants in scarlt livris movd
round th tabl, th clattr of plats, knivs, and glasss mingld with
th animatd hum of svral convrsations. At on nd of th tabl, th
old chambrlain was hard assuring an old baronss that h lovd hr
passionatly, at which sh laughd; at th othr could b hard th
story of th misfortuns of som Mary Víktorovna or othr. At th
cntr of th tabl, Princ Vasíli attractd vrybody’s attntion.
With a factious smil on his fac, h was tlling th ladis about last
Wdnsday’s mting of th Imprial Council, at which Srgy Kuzmích
Vyazmítinov, th nw military govrnor gnral of Ptrsburg, had
rcivd and rad th thn famous rscript of th mpror Alxandr
from th army to Srgy Kuzmích, in which th mpror said that h was
rciving from all sids dclarations of th popl’s loyalty, that
th dclaration from Ptrsburg gav him particular plasur, and that
h was proud to b at th had of such a nation and would ndavor to b
worthy of it. This rscript bgan with th words: “Srgy Kuzmích,
From all sids rports rach m,” tc.
“Wll, and so h nvr got farthr than: ‘Srgy Kuzmích’?”
askd on of th ladis.
“xactly, not a hair’s bradth farthr,” answrd Princ Vasíli,
laughing, “‘Srgy Kuzmích... From all sids... From all sids...
Srgy Kuzmích...’ Poor Vyazmítinov could not gt any farthr!
H bgan th rscript again and again, but as soon as h uttrd
‘Srgy’ h sobbd, ‘Kuz-mí-ch,’ tars, and ‘From all
sids’ was smothrd in sobs and h could gt no farthr. And again
his handkrchif, and again: ‘Srgy Kuzmích, From all sids,’...
and tars, till at last sombody ls was askd to rad it.”
“Kuzmích... From all sids... and thn tars,” somon rpatd
laughing.
“Don’t b unkind,” crid Anna Pávlovna from hr nd of th tabl
holding up a thratning fingr. “H is such a worthy and xcllnt
man, our dar Vyazmítinov....”
vrybody laughd a grat dal. At th had of th tabl, whr th
honord gusts sat, vryon smd to b in high spirits and undr th
influnc of a varity of xciting snsations. Only Pirr and
Hlèn sat silntly sid by sid almost at th bottom of th tabl, a
supprssd smil brightning both thir facs, a smil that had nothing
to do with Srgy Kuzmích—a smil of bashfulnss at thir own
flings. But much as all th rst laughd, talkd, and jokd, much
as thy njoyd thir Rhin win, saut, and ics, and howvr thy
avoidd looking at th young coupl, and hdlss and unobsrvant as
thy smd of thm, on could fl by th occasional glancs thy gav
that th story about Srgy Kuzmích, th laughtr, and th food
wr all a prtns, and that th whol attntion of that company was
dirctd to—Pirr and Hlèn. Princ Vasíli mimickd th sobbing
of Srgy Kuzmích and at th sam tim his ys glancd toward his
daughtr, and whil h laughd th xprssion on his fac clarly said:
“Ys... it’s gtting on, it will all b sttld today.” Anna
Pávlovna thratnd him on bhalf of “our dar Vyazmítinov,” and
in hr ys, which, for an instant, glancd at Pirr, Princ Vasíli
rad a congratulation on his futur son-in-law and on his daughtr’s
happinss. Th old princss sighd sadly as sh offrd som win to th
old lady nxt to hr and glancd angrily at hr daughtr, and hr sigh
smd to say: “Ys, thr’s nothing lft for you and m but to sip
swt win, my dar, now that th tim has com for ths young ons to
b thus boldly, provocativly happy.” “And what nonsns all this is
that I am saying!” thought a diplomatist, glancing at th happy facs
of th lovrs. “That’s happinss!”
Into th insignificant, trifling, and artificial intrsts uniting that
socity had ntrd th simpl fling of th attraction of a halthy
and handsom young man and woman for on anothr. And this human fling
dominatd vrything ls and soard abov all thir affctd chattr.
Jsts fll flat, nws was not intrsting, and th animation was
vidntly forcd. Not only th gusts but vn th footmn waiting at
tabl smd to fl this, and thy forgot thir dutis as thy lookd
at th bautiful Hlèn with hr radiant fac and at th rd, broad,
and happy though unasy fac of Pirr. It smd as if th vry light
of th candls was focusd on thos two happy facs alon.
Pirr flt that h was th cntr of it all, and this both plasd and
mbarrassd him. H was lik a man ntirly absorbd in som occupation.
H did not s, har, or undrstand anything clarly. Only now and
thn dtachd idas and imprssions from th world of rality shot
unxpctdly through his mind.
“So it is all finishd!” h thought. “And how has it all happnd?
How quickly! Now I know that not bcaus of hr alon, nor of myslf
alon, but bcaus of vryon, it must invitably com about. Thy ar
all xpcting it, thy ar so sur that it will happn that I cannot, I
cannot, disappoint thm. But how will it b? I do not know, but it
will crtainly happn!” thought Pirr, glancing at thos dazzling
shouldrs clos to his ys.
Or h would suddnly fl ashamd of h knw not what. H flt it
awkward to attract vryon’s attntion and to b considrd a
lucky man and, with his plain fac, to b lookd on as a sort of Paris
possssd of a Hln. “But no doubt it always is and must b so!”
h consold himslf. “And bsids, what hav I don to bring it about?
How did it bgin? I travld from Moscow with Princ Vasíli. Thn thr
was nothing. So why should I not stay at his hous? Thn I playd cards
with hr and pickd up hr rticul and drov out with hr. How did it
bgin, whn did it all com about?” And hr h was sitting by hr
sid as hr btrothd, sing, haring, fling hr narnss, hr
brathing, hr movmnts, hr bauty. Thn it would suddnly sm to him
that it was not sh but h was so unusually bautiful, and that that was
why thy all lookd so at him, and flattrd by this gnral admiration
h would xpand his chst, rais his had, and rjoic at his good
fortun. Suddnly h hard a familiar voic rpating somthing to him a
scond tim. But Pirr was so absorbd that h did not undrstand what
was said.
“I am asking you whn you last hard from Bolkónski,” rpatd
Princ Vasíli a third tim. “How absnt-mindd you ar, my dar
fllow.”
Princ Vasíli smild, and Pirr noticd that vryon was smiling at
him and Hlèn. “Wll, what of it, if you all know it?” thought
Pirr. “What of it? It’s th truth!” and h himslf smild his
gntl childlik smil, and Hlèn smild too.
“Whn did you gt th lttr? Was it from Olmütz?” rpatd
Princ Vasíli, who prtndd to want to know this in ordr to sttl a
disput.
“How can on talk or think of such trifls?” thought Pirr.
“Ys, from Olmütz,” h answrd, with a sigh.
Aftr suppr Pirr with his partnr followd th othrs into th
drawing room. Th gusts bgan to disprs, som without taking lav
of Hlèn. Som, as if unwilling to distract hr from an important
occupation, cam up to hr for a momnt and mad hast to go away,
rfusing to lt hr s thm off. Th diplomatist prsrvd a mournful
silnc as h lft th drawing room. H picturd th vanity of his
diplomatic carr in comparison with Pirr’s happinss. Th old
gnral grumbld at his wif whn sh askd how his lg was. “Oh, th
old fool,” h thought. “That Princss Hlèn will b bautiful
still whn sh’s fifty.”
“I think I may congratulat you,” whisprd Anna Pávlovna to th
old princss, kissing hr soundly. “If I hadn’t this hadach I’d
hav stayd longr.”
Th old princss did not rply, sh was tormntd by jalousy of hr
daughtr’s happinss.
Whil th gusts wr taking thir lav Pirr rmaind for a long tim
alon with Hlèn in th littl drawing room whr thy wr sitting.
H had oftn bfor, during th last six wks, rmaind alon with hr,
but had nvr spokn to hr of lov. Now h flt that it was invitabl,
but h could not mak up his mind to tak th final stp. H flt
ashamd; h flt that h was occupying somon ls’s plac hr
bsid Hlèn. “This happinss is not for you,” som innr voic
whisprd to him. “This happinss is for thos who hav not in thm
what thr is in you.”
But, as h had to say somthing, h bgan by asking hr whthr sh was
satisfid with th party. Sh rplid in hr usual simpl mannr that
this nam day of hrs had bn on of th plasantst sh had vr had.
Som of th narst rlativs had not yt lft. Thy wr sitting in
th larg drawing room. Princ Vasíli cam up to Pirr with languid
footstps. Pirr ros and said it was gtting lat. Princ Vasíli gav
him a look of strn inquiry, as though what Pirr had just said was
so strang that on could not tak it in. But thn th xprssion of
svrity changd, and h drw Pirr’s hand downwards, mad him sit
down, and smild affctionatly.
“Wll, Lëlya?” h askd, turning instantly to his daughtr and
addrssing hr with th carlss ton of habitual tndrnss natural to
parnts who hav pttd thir childrn from babyhood, but which Princ
Vasíli had only acquird by imitating othr parnts.
And h again turnd to Pirr.
“Srgy Kuzmích—From all sids—” h said, unbuttoning th top
button of his waistcoat.
Pirr smild, but his smil showd that h knw it was not th story
about Srgy Kuzmích that intrstd Princ Vasíli just thn, and
Princ Vasíli saw that Pirr knw this. H suddnly muttrd
somthing and wnt away. It smd to Pirr that vn th princ was
disconcrtd. Th sight of th discomposur of that old man of th world
touchd Pirr: h lookd at Hlèn and sh too smd disconcrtd,
and hr look smd to say: “Wll, it is your own fault.”
“Th stp must b takn but I cannot, I cannot!” thought Pirr,
and h again bgan spaking about indiffrnt mattrs, about Srgy
Kuzmích, asking what th point of th story was as h had not hard it
proprly. Hlèn answrd with a smil that sh too had missd it.
Whn Princ Vasíli rturnd to th drawing room, th princss, his
wif, was talking in low tons to th ldrly lady about Pirr.
“Of cours, it is a vry brilliant match, but happinss, my dar...”
“Marriags ar mad in havn,” rplid th ldrly lady.
Princ Vasíli passd by, sming not to har th ladis, and sat down
on a sofa in a far cornr of th room. H closd his ys and smd to
b dozing. His had sank forward and thn h rousd himslf.
“Alin,” h said to his wif, “go and s what thy ar about.”
Th princss wnt up to th door, passd by it with a dignifid and
indiffrnt air, and glancd into th littl drawing room. Pirr and
Hlèn still sat talking just as bfor.
“Still th sam,” sh said to hr husband.
Princ Vasíli frownd, twisting his mouth, his chks quivrd and his
fac assumd th coars, unplasant xprssion pculiar to him. Shaking
himslf, h ros, thrw back his had, and with rsolut stps wnt
past th ladis into th littl drawing room. With quick stps h wnt
joyfully up to Pirr. His fac was so unusually triumphant that Pirr
ros in alarm on sing it.
“Thank God!” said Princ Vasíli. “My wif has told m
vrything!” (H put on arm around Pirr and th othr around his
daughtr.)—“My dar boy... Lëlya... I am vry plasd.” (His
voic trmbld.) “I lovd your fathr... and sh will mak you a good
wif... God blss you!...”
H mbracd his daughtr, and thn again Pirr, and kissd him with his
malodorous mouth. Tars actually moistnd his chks.
“Princss, com hr!” h shoutd.
Th old princss cam in and also wpt. Th ldrly lady was using
hr handkrchif too. Pirr was kissd, and h kissd th bautiful
Hlèn’s hand svral tims. Aftr a whil thy wr lft alon
again.
“All this had to b and could not b othrwis,” thought Pirr,
“so it is uslss to ask whthr it is good or bad. It is good bcaus
it’s dfinit and on is rid of th old tormnting doubt.” Pirr
hld th hand of his btrothd in silnc, looking at hr bautiful
bosom as it ros and fll.
“Hlèn!” h said aloud and pausd.
“Somthing spcial is always said in such cass,” h thought, but
could not rmmbr what it was that popl say. H lookd at hr fac.
Sh drw narr to him. Hr fac flushd.
“Oh, tak thos off... thos...” sh said, pointing to his
spctacls.
Pirr took thm off, and his ys, bsids th strang look ys hav
from which spctacls hav just bn rmovd, had also a frightnd and
inquiring look. H was about to stoop ovr hr hand and kiss it, but
with a rapid, almost brutal movmnt of hr had, sh intrcptd his
lips and mt thm with hr own. Hr fac struck Pirr, by its altrd,
unplasantly xcitd xprssion.
“It is too lat now, it’s don; bsids I lov hr,” thought
Pirr.
“J vous aim!” * h said, rmmbring what has to b said at such
momnts: but his words soundd so wak that h flt ashamd of himslf.
    * “I lov you.”
Six wks latr h was marrid, and sttld in Count Bzúkhov’s
larg, nwly furnishd Ptrsburg hous, th happy possssor, as popl
said, of a wif who was a clbratd bauty and of millions of mony.
CHAPTR III
Old Princ Nicholas Bolkónski rcivd a lttr from Princ Vasíli
in Novmbr, 1805, announcing that h and his son would b paying him
a visit. “I am starting on a journy of inspction, and of cours I
shall think nothing of an xtra svnty mils to com and s you at
th sam tim, my honord bnfactor,” wrot Princ Vasíli. “My son
Anatol is accompanying m on his way to th army, so I hop you will
allow him prsonally to xprss th dp rspct that, mulating his
fathr, h fls for you.”
“It sms that thr will b no nd to bring Mary out, suitors ar
coming to us of thir own accord,” incautiously rmarkd th littl
princss on haring th nws.
Princ Nicholas frownd, but said nothing.
A fortnight aftr th lttr Princ Vasíli’s srvants cam on
vning in advanc of him, and h and his son arrivd nxt day.
Old Bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of Princ Vasíli’s
charactr, but mor so rcntly, sinc in th nw rigns of Paul and
Alxandr Princ Vasíli had risn to high position and honors. And now,
from th hints containd in his lttr and givn by th littl princss,
h saw which way th wind was blowing, and his low opinion changd into
a fling of contmptuous ill will. H snortd whnvr h mntiond
him. On th day of Princ Vasíli’s arrival, Princ Bolkónski was
particularly discontntd and out of tmpr. Whthr h was in a bad
tmpr bcaus Princ Vasíli was coming, or whthr his bing in a bad
tmpr mad him spcially annoyd at Princ Vasíli’s visit, h was
in a bad tmpr, and in th morning Tíkhon had alrady advisd th
architct not to go to th princ with his rport.
“Do you har how h’s walking?” said Tíkhon, drawing th
architct’s attntion to th sound of th princ’s footstps.
“Stpping flat on his hls—w know what that mans....”
Howvr, at nin o’clock th princ, in his vlvt coat with a sabl
collar and cap, wnt out for his usual walk. It had snowd th day
bfor and th path to th hothous, along which th princ was in th
habit of walking, had bn swpt: th marks of th broom wr still
visibl in th snow and a shovl had bn lft sticking in on of th
soft snowbanks that bordrd both sids of th path. Th princ wnt
through th consrvatoris, th srfs’ quartrs, and th outbuildings,
frowning and silnt.
“Can a sligh pass?” h askd his ovrsr, a vnrabl man,
rsmbling his mastr in mannrs and looks, who was accompanying him
back to th hous.
“Th snow is dp. I am having th avnu swpt, your honor.”
Th princ bowd his had and wnt up to th porch. “God b
thankd,” thought th ovrsr, “th storm has blown ovr!”
“It would hav bn hard to driv up, your honor,” h addd. “I
hard, your honor, that a ministr is coming to visit your honor.”
Th princ turnd round to th ovrsr and fixd his ys on him,
frowning.
“What? A ministr? What ministr? Who gav ordrs?” h said in
his shrill, harsh voic. “Th road is not swpt for th princss my
daughtr, but for a ministr! For m, thr ar no ministrs!”
“Your honor, I thought...”
“You thought!” shoutd th princ, his words coming mor and mor
rapidly and indistinctly. “You thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!...
I’ll tach you to think!” and lifting his stick h swung it and
would hav hit Alpátych, th ovrsr, had not th lattr instinctivly
avoidd th blow. “Thought... Blackguards...” shoutd th princ
rapidly.
But although Alpátych, frightnd at his own tmrity in avoiding th
strok, cam up to th princ, bowing his bald had rsigndly bfor
him, or prhaps for that vry rason, th princ, though h continud
to shout: “Blackguards!... Throw th snow back on th road!” did not
lift his stick again but hurrid into th hous.
Bfor dinnr, Princss Mary and Madmoisll Bourinn, who knw
that th princ was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Madmoisll
Bourinn with a radiant fac that said: “I know nothing, I am th
sam as usual,” and Princss Mary pal, frightnd, and with downcast
ys. What sh found hardst to bar was to know that on such occasions
sh ought to bhav lik Madmoisll Bourinn, but could not.
Sh thought: “If I sm not to notic h will think that I do not
sympathiz with him; if I sm sad and out of spirits myslf, h will
say (as h has don bfor) that I’m in th dumps.”
Th princ lookd at his daughtr’s frightnd fac and snortd.
“Fool... or dummy!” h muttrd.
“And th othr on is not hr. Thy’v bn tlling tals,” h
thought—rfrring to th littl princss who was not in th dining
room.
“Whr is th princss?” h askd. “Hiding?”
“Sh is not vry wll,” answrd Madmoisll Bourinn with
a bright smil, “so sh won’t com down. It is natural in hr
stat.”
“Hm! Hm!” muttrd th princ, sitting down.
His plat smd to him not quit clan, and pointing to a spot h
flung it away. Tíkhon caught it and handd it to a footman. Th littl
princss was not unwll, but had such an ovrpowring far of th princ
that, haring h was in a bad humor, sh had dcidd not to appar.
“I am afraid for th baby,” sh said to Madmoisll Bourinn:
“Havn knows what a fright might do.”
In gnral at Bald Hills th littl princss livd in constant far, and
with a sns of antipathy to th old princ which sh did not
raliz bcaus th far was so much th strongr fling. Th princ
rciprocatd this antipathy, but it was ovrpowrd by his contmpt
for hr. Whn th littl princss had grown accustomd to lif at Bald
Hills, sh took a spcial fancy to Madmoisll Bourinn, spnt whol
days with hr, askd hr to slp in hr room, and oftn talkd with hr
about th old princ and criticizd him.
“So w ar to hav visitors, mon princ?” rmarkd Madmoisll
Bourinn, unfolding hr whit napkin with hr rosy fingrs. “His
xcllncy Princ Vasíli Kurágin and his son, I undrstand?” sh
said inquiringly.
“Hm!—his xcllncy is a puppy.... I got him his appointmnt in th
srvic,” said th princ disdainfully. “Why his son is coming I
don’t undrstand. Prhaps Princss lizabth and Princss Mary know.
I don’t want him.” (H lookd at his blushing daughtr.) “Ar you
unwll today? h? Afraid of th ‘ministr’ as that idiot Alpátych
calld him this morning?”
“No, mon pèr.”
Though Madmoisll Bourinn had bn so unsuccssful in hr choic
of a subjct, sh did not stop talking, but chattrd about th
consrvatoris and th bauty of a flowr that had just opnd, and
aftr th soup th princ bcam mor gnial.
Aftr dinnr, h wnt to s his daughtr-in-law. Th littl princss
was sitting at a small tabl, chattring with Másha, hr maid. Sh grw
pal on sing hr fathr-in-law.
Sh was much altrd. Sh was now plain rathr than prtty. Hr chks
had sunk, hr lip was drawn up, and hr ys drawn down.
“Ys, I fl a kind of opprssion,” sh said in rply to th
princ’s qustion as to how sh flt.
“Do you want anything?”
“No, mrci, mon pèr.”
“Wll, all right, all right.”
H lft th room and wnt to th waiting room whr Alpátych stood with
bowd had.
“Has th snow bn shovld back?”
“Ys, your xcllncy. Forgiv m for havn’s sak... It was only
my stupidity.”
“All right, all right,” intrruptd th princ, and laughing his
unnatural way, h strtchd out his hand for Alpátych to kiss, and thn
procdd to his study.
Princ Vasíli arrivd that vning. H was mt in th avnu by
coachmn and footmn, who, with loud shouts, draggd his slighs up to
on of th lodgs ovr th road purposly ladn with snow.
Princ Vasíli and Anatol had sparat rooms assignd to thm.
Anatol, having takn off his ovrcoat, sat with arms akimbo bfor a
tabl on a cornr of which h smilingly and absnt-minddly fixd his
larg and handsom ys. H rgardd his whol lif as a continual round
of amusmnt which somon for som rason had to provid for him.
And h lookd on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
hirss in th sam way. All this might, h thought, turn out vry wll
and amusingly. “And why not marry hr if sh rally has so much mony?
That nvr dos any harm,” thought Anatol.
H shavd and scntd himslf with th car and lganc which had
bcom habitual to him and, his handsom had hld high, ntrd his
fathr’s room with th good-humord and victorious air natural to
him. Princ Vasíli’s two valts wr busy drssing him, and h lookd
round with much animation and chrfully noddd to his son as th lattr
ntrd, as if to say: “Ys, that’s how I want you to look.”
“I say, Fathr, joking apart, is sh vry hidous?” Anatol askd,
as if continuing a convrsation th subjct of which had oftn bn
mntiond during th journy.
“nough! What nonsns! Abov all, try to b rspctful and cautious
with th old princ.”
“If h starts a row I’ll go away,” said Princ Anatol. “I
can’t bar thos old mn! h?”
“Rmmbr, for you vrything dpnds on this.”
In th mantim, not only was it known in th maidsrvants’ rooms that
th ministr and his son had arrivd, but th apparanc of both had
bn minutly dscribd. Princss Mary was sitting alon in hr room,
vainly trying to mastr hr agitation.
“Why did thy writ, why did Lis tll m about it? It can nvr
happn!” sh said, looking at hrslf in th glass. “How shall I
ntr th drawing room? vn if I lik him I can’t now b myslf with
him.” Th mr thought of hr fathr’s look filld hr with trror.
Th littl princss and Madmoisll Bourinn had alrady rcivd
from Másha, th lady’s maid, th ncssary rport of how handsom th
ministr’s son was, with his rosy chks and dark ybrows, and with
what difficulty th fathr had draggd his lgs upstairs whil th son
had followd him lik an agl, thr stps at a tim. Having rcivd
this information, th littl princss and Madmoisll Bourinn, whos
chattring voics had rachd hr from th corridor, wnt into Princss
Mary’s room.
“You know thy’v com, Mari?” said th littl princss, waddling
in, and sinking havily into an armchair.
Sh was no longr in th loos gown sh gnrally wor in th morning,
but had on on of hr bst drsss. Hr hair was carfully don and hr
fac was animatd, which, howvr, did not concal its sunkn and fadd
outlins. Drssd as sh usd to b in Ptrsburg socity, it was still
mor noticabl how much plainr sh had bcom. Som unobtrusiv touch
had bn addd to Madmoisll Bourinn’s toilt which rndrd hr
frsh and prtty fac yt mor attractiv.
“What! Ar you going to rmain as you ar, dar princss?” sh
bgan. “Thy’ll b announcing that th gntlmn ar in th drawing
room and w shall hav to go down, and you hav not smartnd yourslf
up at all!”
Th littl princss got up, rang for th maid, and hurridly and mrrily
bgan to dvis and carry out a plan of how Princss Mary should b
drssd. Princss Mary’s slf-stm was woundd by th fact that
th arrival of a suitor agitatd hr, and still mor so by both
hr companions’ not having th last concption that it could b
othrwis. To tll thm that sh flt ashamd for hrslf and for thm
would b to btray hr agitation, whil to dclin thir offrs to
drss hr would prolong thir bantr and insistnc. Sh flushd, hr
bautiful ys grw dim, rd blotchs cam on hr fac, and it took
on th unattractiv martyrlik xprssion it so oftn wor, as sh
submittd hrslf to Madmoisll Bourinn and Lis. Both ths womn
quit sincrly trid to mak hr look prtty. Sh was so plain that
nithr of thm could think of hr as a rival, so thy bgan drssing
hr with prfct sincrity, and with th naïv and firm conviction
womn hav that drss can mak a fac prtty.
“No rally, my dar, this drss is not prtty,” said Lis, looking
sidways at Princss Mary from a littl distanc. “You hav a maroon
drss, hav it ftchd. Rally! You know th fat of your whol lif may
b at stak. But this on is too light, it’s not bcoming!”
It was not th drss, but th fac and whol figur of Princss Mary
that was not prtty, but nithr Madmoisll Bourinn nor th littl
princss flt this; thy still thought that if a blu ribbon wr placd
in th hair, th hair combd up, and th blu scarf arrangd lowr on
th bst maroon drss, and so on, all would b wll. Thy forgot that
th frightnd fac and th figur could not b altrd, and that
howvr thy might chang th stting and adornmnt of that fac, it
would still rmain pitous and plain. Aftr two or thr changs to
which Princss Mary mkly submittd, just as hr hair had bn arrangd
on th top of hr had (a styl that quit altrd and spoild hr
looks) and sh had put on a maroon drss with a pal-blu scarf, th
littl princss walkd twic round hr, now adjusting a fold of th
drss with hr littl hand, now arranging th scarf and looking at hr
with hr had bnt first on on sid and thn on th othr.
“No, it will not do,” sh said dciddly, clasping hr hands. “No,
Mary, rally this drss dos not suit you. I prfr you in your littl
gray vryday drss. Now plas, do it for my sak. Kati,” sh said
to th maid, “bring th princss hr gray drss, and you’ll s,
Madmoisll Bourinn, how I shall arrang it,” sh addd, smiling
with a fortast of artistic plasur.
But whn Kati brought th rquird drss, Princss Mary rmaind
sitting motionlss bfor th glass, looking at hr fac, and saw in th
mirror hr ys full of tars and hr mouth quivring, rady to burst
into sobs.
“Com, dar princss,” said Madmoisll Bourinn, “just on mor
littl ffort.”
Th littl princss, taking th drss from th maid, cam up to Princss
Mary.
“Wll, now w’ll arrang somthing quit simpl and bcoming,” sh
said.
Th thr voics, hrs, Madmoisll Bourinn’s, and Kati’s, who
was laughing at somthing, mingld in a mrry sound, lik th chirping
of birds.
“No, lav m alon,” said Princss Mary.
Hr voic soundd so srious and so sad that th chirping of th birds
was silncd at onc. Thy lookd at th bautiful, larg, thoughtful
ys full of tars and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at
thm, and undrstood that it was uslss and vn crul to insist.
“At last, chang your coiffur,” said th littl princss.
“Didn’t I tll you,” sh wnt on, turning rproachfully to
Madmoisll Bourinn, “Mary’s is a fac which such a coiffur dos
not suit in th last. Not in th last! Plas chang it.”
“Lav m alon, plas lav m alon! It is all quit th sam to
m,” answrd a voic struggling with tars.
Madmoisll Bourinn and th littl princss had to own to thmslvs
that Princss Mary in this guis lookd vry plain, wors than usual,
but it was too lat. Sh was looking at thm with an xprssion thy
both knw, an xprssion thoughtful and sad. This xprssion in Princss
Mary did not frightn thm (sh nvr inspird far in anyon), but thy
knw that whn it appard on hr fac, sh bcam mut and was not to
b shakn in hr dtrmination.
“You will chang it, won’t you?” said Lis. And as Princss Mary
gav no answr, sh lft th room.
Princss Mary was lft alon. Sh did not comply with Lis’s rqust,
sh not only lft hr hair as it was, but did not vn look in hr
glass. Ltting hr arms fall hlplssly, sh sat with downcast ys and
pondrd. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangly attractiv
bing ros in hr imagination, and carrid hr into a totally diffrnt
happy world of his own. Sh fancid a child, hr own—such as sh had
sn th day bfor in th arms of hr nurs’s daughtr—at hr
own brast, th husband standing by and gazing tndrly at hr and th
child. “But no, it is impossibl, I am too ugly,” sh thought.
“Plas com to ta. Th princ will b out in a momnt,” cam th
maid’s voic at th door.
Sh rousd hrslf, and flt appalld at what sh had bn thinking, and
bfor going down sh wnt into th room whr th icons hung and, hr
ys fixd on th dark fac of a larg icon of th Saviour lit by a
lamp, sh stood bfor it with foldd hands for a fw momnts. A painful
doubt filld hr soul. Could th joy of lov, of arthly lov for a
man, b for hr? In hr thoughts of marriag Princss Mary dramd of
happinss and of childrn, but hr strongst, most dply hiddn longing
was for arthly lov. Th mor sh trid to hid this fling from
othrs and vn from hrslf, th strongr it grw. “O God,” sh
said, “how am I to stifl in my hart ths tmptations of th dvil?
How am I to rnounc forvr ths vil fancis, so as pacfully to
fulfill Thy will?” And scarcly had sh put that qustion than God
gav hr th answr in hr own hart. “Dsir nothing for thyslf,
sk nothing, b not anxious or nvious. Man’s futur and thy own fat
must rmain hiddn from th, but liv so that thou mayst b rady for
anything. If it b God’s will to prov th in th dutis of marriag,
b rady to fulfill His will.” With this consoling thought (but
yt with a hop for th fulfillmnt of hr forbiddn arthly longing)
Princss Mary sighd, and having crossd hrslf wnt down, thinking
nithr of hr gown and coiffur nor of how sh would go in nor of what
sh would say. What could all that mattr in comparison with th will of
God, without Whos car not a hair of man’s had can fall?
CHAPTR IV
Whn Princss Mary cam down, Princ Vasíli and his son wr alrady
in th drawing room, talking to th littl princss and Madmoisll
Bourinn. Whn sh ntrd with hr havy stp, trading on hr hls,
th gntlmn and Madmoisll Bourinn ros and th littl princss,
indicating hr to th gntlmn, said: “Voilà Mari!” Princss Mary
saw thm all and saw thm in dtail. Sh saw Princ Vasíli’s fac,
srious for an instant at th sight of hr, but immdiatly smiling
again, and th littl princss curiously noting th imprssion
“Mari” producd on th visitors. And sh saw Madmoisll
Bourinn, with hr ribbon and prtty fac, and hr unusually animatd
look which was fixd on him, but him sh could not s, sh only saw
somthing larg, brilliant, and handsom moving toward hr as sh
ntrd th room. Princ Vasíli approachd first, and sh kissd th
bold forhad that bnt ovr hr hand and answrd his qustion by
saying that, on th contrary, sh rmmbrd him quit wll. Thn
Anatol cam up to hr. Sh still could not s him. Sh only flt a
soft hand taking hrs firmly, and sh touchd with hr lips a whit
forhad, ovr which was bautiful light-brown hair smlling of pomad.
Whn sh lookd up at him sh was struck by his bauty. Anatol stood
with his right thumb undr a button of his uniform, his chst xpandd
and his back drawn in, slightly swinging on foot, and, with his had a
littl bnt, lookd with baming fac at th princss without
spaking and vidntly not thinking about hr at all. Anatol was not
quick-wittd, nor rady or loqunt in convrsation, but h had th
faculty, so invaluabl in socity, of composur and imprturbabl
slf-possssion. If a man lacking in slf-confidnc rmains dumb on
a first introduction and btrays a consciousnss of th improprity of
such silnc and an anxity to find somthing to say, th ffct is
bad. But Anatol was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly xamind th
princss’ hair. It was vidnt that h could b silnt in this way for
a vry long tim. “If anyon finds this silnc inconvnint, lt him
talk, but I don’t want to,” h smd to say. Bsids this, in his
bhavior to womn Anatol had a mannr which particularly inspirs in
thm curiosity, aw, and vn lov—a suprcilious consciousnss of
his own supriority. It was as if h said to thm: “I know you, I know
you, but why should I bothr about you? You’d b only too glad, of
cours.” Prhaps h did not rally think this whn h mt womn—vn
probably h did not, for in gnral h thought vry littl—but his
looks and mannr gav that imprssion. Th princss flt this, and as if
wishing to show him that sh did not vn dar xpct to intrst him,
sh turnd to his fathr. Th convrsation was gnral and animatd,
thanks to Princss Lis’s voic and littl downy lip that liftd ovr
hr whit tth. Sh mt Princ Vasíli with that playful mannr oftn
mployd by livly chatty popl, and consisting in th assumption
that btwn th prson thy so addrss and thmslvs thr ar som
smi-privat, long-stablishd joks and amusing rminiscncs, though
no such rminiscncs rally xist—just as non xistd in this cas.
Princ Vasíli radily adoptd hr ton and th littl princss also
drw Anatol, whom sh hardly knw, into ths amusing rcollctions of
things that had nvr occurrd. Madmoisll Bourinn also shard thm
and vn Princss Mary flt hrslf plasantly mad to shar in ths
mrry rminiscncs.
“Hr at last w shall hav th bnfit of your company all to
ourslvs, dar princ,” said th littl princss (of cours, in
Frnch) to Princ Vasíli. “It’s not as at Anntt’s * rcptions
whr you always ran away; you rmmbr ctt chèr Anntt!”
    * Anna Pávlovna.
“Ah, but you won’t talk politics to m lik Anntt!”
“And our littl ta tabl?”
“Oh, ys!”
“Why is it you wr nvr at Anntt’s?” th littl princss askd
Anatol. “Ah, I know, I know,” sh said with a sly glanc, “your
brothr Hippolyt told m about your goings on. Oh!” and sh shook hr
fingr at him, “I hav vn hard of your doings in Paris!”
“And didn’t Hippolyt tll you?” askd Princ Vasíli, turning to
his son and sizing th littl princss’ arm as if sh would hav run
away and h had just managd to catch hr, “didn’t h tll you how
h himslf was pining for th dar princss, and how sh showd him th
door? Oh, sh is a parl among womn, Princss,” h addd, turning to
Princss Mary.
Whn Paris was mntiond, Madmoisll Bourinn for hr part sizd th
opportunity of joining in th gnral currnt of rcollctions.
Sh took th librty of inquiring whthr it was long sinc Anatol
had lft Paris and how h had likd that city. Anatol answrd th
Frnchwoman vry radily and, looking at hr with a smil, talkd to hr
about hr nativ land. Whn h saw th prtty littl Bourinn, Anatol
cam to th conclusion that h would not find Bald Hills dull ithr.
“Not at all bad!” h thought, xamining hr, “not at all bad, that
littl companion! I hop sh will bring hr along with hr whn w’r
marrid, la ptit st gntill.” *
    * Th littl on is charming.
Th old princ drssd lisurly in his study, frowning and considring
what h was to do. Th coming of ths visitors annoyd him. “What ar
Princ Vasíli and that son of his to m? Princ Vasíli is a shallow
braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fin spcimn,” h grumbld to
himslf. What angrd him was that th coming of ths visitors rvivd
in his mind an unsttld qustion h always trid to stifl, on about
which h always dcivd himslf. Th qustion was whthr h could vr
bring himslf to part from his daughtr and giv hr to a husband. Th
princ nvr dirctly askd himslf that qustion, knowing bforhand
that h would hav to answr it justly, and justic clashd not only
with his flings but with th vry possibility of lif. Lif without
Princss Mary, littl as h smd to valu hr, was unthinkabl to
him. “And why should sh marry?” h thought. “To b unhappy for
crtain. Thr’s Lis, marrid to Andrw—a bttr husband on would
think could hardly b found nowadays—but is sh contntd with hr
lot? And who would marry Mari for lov? Plain and awkward! Thy’ll
tak hr for hr connctions and walth. Ar thr no womn living
unmarrid, and vn th happir for it?” So thought Princ Bolkónski
whil drssing, and yt th qustion h was always putting off dmandd
an immdiat answr. Princ Vasíli had brought his son with th vidnt
intntion of proposing, and today or tomorrow h would probably ask
for an answr. His birth and position in socity wr not bad. “Wll,
I’v nothing against it,” th princ said to himslf, “but h must
b worthy of hr. And that is what w shall s.”
“That is what w shall s! That is what w shall s!” h addd
aloud.
H ntrd th drawing room with his usual alrt stp, glancing rapidly
round th company. H noticd th chang in th littl princss’
drss, Madmoisll Bourinn’s ribbon, Princss Mary’s unbcoming
coiffur, Madmoisll Bourinn’s and Anatol’s smils, and th
lonlinss of his daughtr amid th gnral convrsation. “Got hrslf
up lik a fool!” h thought, looking irritably at hr. “Sh is
shamlss, and h ignors hr!”
H wnt straight up to Princ Vasíli.
“Wll! How d’y do? How d’y do? Glad to s you!”
“Frindship laughs at distanc,” bgan Princ Vasíli in his usual
rapid, slf-confidnt, familiar ton. “Hr is my scond son; plas
lov and bfrind him.”
Princ Bolkónski survyd Anatol.
“Fin young fllow! Fin young fllow!” h said. “Wll, com and
kiss m,” and h offrd his chk.
Anatol kissd th old man, and lookd at him with curiosity and prfct
composur, waiting for a display of th ccntricitis his fathr had
told him to xpct.
Princ Bolkónski sat down in his usual plac in th cornr of th sofa
and, drawing up an armchair for Princ Vasíli, pointd to it and bgan
qustioning him about political affairs and nws. H smd to listn
attntivly to what Princ Vasíli said, but kpt glancing at Princss
Mary.
“And so thy ar writing from Potsdam alrady?” h said, rpating
Princ Vasíli’s last words. Thn rising, h suddnly wnt up to his
daughtr.
“Is it for visitors you’v got yourslf up lik that, h?” said
h. “Fin, vry fin! You hav don up your hair in this nw way for
th visitors, and bfor th visitors I tll you that in futur you ar
nvr to dar to chang your way of drss without my consnt.”
“It was my fault, mon pèr,” intrcdd th littl princss, with a
blush.
“You must do as you plas,” said Princ Bolkónski, bowing to his
daughtr-in-law, “but sh nd not mak a fool of hrslf, sh’s
plain nough as it is.”
And h sat down again, paying no mor attntion to his daughtr, who was
rducd to tars.
“On th contrary, that coiffur suits th princss vry wll,” said
Princ Vasíli.
“Now you, young princ, what’s your nam?” said Princ Bolkónski,
turning to Anatol, “com hr, lt us talk and gt acquaintd.”
“Now th fun bgins,” thought Anatol, sitting down with a smil
bsid th old princ.
“Wll, my dar boy, I har you’v bn ducatd abroad, not taught
to rad and writ by th dacon, lik your fathr and m. Now tll m,
my dar boy, ar you srving in th Hors Guards?” askd th old man,
scrutinizing Anatol closly and intntly.
“No, I hav bn transfrrd to th lin,” said Anatol, hardly abl
to rstrain his laughtr.
“Ah! That’s a good thing. So, my dar boy, you wish to srv th
Tsar and th country? It is wartim. Such a fin fllow must srv.
Wll, ar you off to th front?”
“No, Princ, our rgimnt has gon to th front, but I am attachd...
what is it I am attachd to, Papa?” said Anatol, turning to his
fathr with a laugh.
“A splndid soldir, splndid! ‘What am I attachd to!’ Ha, ha,
ha!” laughd Princ Bolkónski, and Anatol laughd still loudr.
Suddnly Princ Bolkónski frownd.
“You may go,” h said to Anatol.
Anatol rturnd smiling to th ladis.
“And so you’v had him ducatd abroad, Princ Vasíli, havn’t
you?” said th old princ to Princ Vasíli.
“I hav don my bst for him, and I can assur you th ducation thr
is much bttr than ours.”
“Ys, vrything is diffrnt nowadays, vrything is changd. Th
lad’s a fin fllow, a fin fllow! Wll, com with m now.” H took
Princ Vasíli’s arm and ld him to his study. As soon as thy wr
alon togthr, Princ Vasíli announcd his hops and wishs to th old
princ.
“Wll, do you think I shall prvnt hr, that I can’t part from
hr?” said th old princ angrily. “What an ida! I’m rady for it
tomorrow! Only lt m tll you, I want to know my son-in-law bttr. You
know my principls—vrything abovboard! I will ask hr tomorrow in
your prsnc; if sh is willing, thn h can stay on. H can stay and
I’ll s.” Th old princ snortd. “Lt hr marry, it’s all th
sam to m!” h scramd in th sam pircing ton as whn parting
from his son.
“I will tll you frankly,” said Princ Vasíli in th ton of
a crafty man convincd of th futility of bing cunning with so
kn-sightd a companion. “You know, you s right through popl.
Anatol is no gnius, but h is an honst, goodhartd lad; an xcllnt
son or kinsman.”
“All right, all right, w’ll s!”
As always happns whn womn lad lonly livs for any lngth of tim
without mal socity, on Anatol’s apparanc all th thr womn of
Princ Bolkónski’s houshold flt that thir lif had not bn ral
till thn. Thir powrs of rasoning, fling, and obsrving immdiatly
incrasd tnfold, and thir lif, which smd to hav bn passd in
darknss, was suddnly lit up by a nw brightnss, full of significanc.
Princss Mary grw quit unconscious of hr fac and coiffur. Th
handsom opn fac of th man who might prhaps b hr husband absorbd
all hr attntion. H smd to hr kind, brav, dtrmind, manly, and
magnanimous. Sh flt convincd of that. Thousands of drams of a futur
family lif continually ros in hr imagination. Sh drov thm away and
trid to concal thm.
“But am I not too cold with him?” thought th princss. “I try
to b rsrvd bcaus in th dpth of my soul I fl too nar to him
alrady, but thn h cannot know what I think of him and may imagin
that I do not lik him.”
And Princss Mary trid, but could not manag, to b cordial to hr nw
gust. “Poor girl, sh’s dvilish ugly!” thought Anatol.
Madmoisll Bourinn, also rousd to grat xcitmnt by Anatol’s
arrival, thought in anothr way. Of cours, sh, a handsom young woman
without any dfinit position, without rlations or vn a country, did
not intnd to dvot hr lif to srving Princ Bolkónski, to rading
aloud to him and bing frinds with Princss Mary. Madmoisll
Bourinn had long bn waiting for a Russian princ who, abl to
apprciat at a glanc hr supriority to th plain, badly drssd,
ungainly Russian princsss, would fall in lov with hr and carry hr
off; and hr at last was a Russian princ. Madmoisll Bourinn knw
a story, hard from hr aunt but finishd in hr own way, which sh
likd to rpat to hrslf. It was th story of a girl who had bn
sducd, and to whom hr poor mothr (sa pauvr mèr) appard, and
rproachd hr for yilding to a man without bing marrid. Madmoisll
Bourinn was oftn touchd to tars as in imagination sh told this
story to him, hr sducr. And now h, a ral Russian princ, had
appard. H would carry hr away and thn sa pauvr mèr would appar
and h would marry hr. So hr futur shapd itslf in Madmoisll
Bourinn’s had at th vry tim sh was talking to Anatol about
Paris. It was not calculation that guidd hr (sh did not vn for a
momnt considr what sh should do), but all this had long bn familiar
to hr, and now that Anatol had appard it just groupd itslf around
him and sh wishd and trid to plas him as much as possibl.
Th littl princss, lik an old war hors that hars th trumpt,
unconsciously and quit forgtting hr condition, prpard for th
familiar gallop of coqutry, without any ultrior motiv or any
struggl, but with naïv and lighthartd gaity.
Although in fmal socity Anatol usually assumd th rol of a man
tird of bing run aftr by womn, his vanity was flattrd by th
spctacl of his powr ovr ths thr womn. Bsids that, h was
bginning to fl for th prtty and provocativ Madmoisll Bourinn
that passionat animal fling which was apt to mastr him with grat
suddnnss and prompt him to th coarsst and most rcklss actions.
Aftr ta, th company wnt into th sitting room and Princss Mary was
askd to play on th clavichord. Anatol, laughing and in high spirits,
cam and land on his lbows, facing hr and bsid Madmoisll
Bourinn. Princss Mary flt his look with a painfully joyous motion.
Hr favorit sonata bor hr into a most intimatly potic world and
th look sh flt upon hr mad that world still mor potic. But
Anatol’s xprssion, though his ys wr fixd on hr, rfrrd not
to hr but to th movmnts of Madmoisll Bourinn’s littl
foot, which h was thn touching with his own undr th clavichord.
Madmoisll Bourinn was also looking at Princss Mary, and in hr
lovly ys thr was a look of farful joy and hop that was also nw
to th princss.
“How sh lovs m!” thought Princss Mary. “How happy I am now,
and how happy I may b with such a frind and such a husband! Husband?
Can it b possibl?” sh thought, not daring to look at his fac, but
still fling his ys gazing at hr.
In th vning, aftr suppr, whn all wr about to rtir, Anatol
kissd Princss Mary’s hand. Sh did not know how sh found th
courag, but sh lookd straight into his handsom fac as it cam nar
to hr shortsightd ys. Turning from Princss Mary h wnt up and
kissd Madmoisll Bourinn’s hand. (This was not tiqutt, but
thn h did vrything so simply and with such assuranc!) Madmoisll
Bourinn flushd, and gav th princss a frightnd look.
“What dlicacy!” thought th princss. “Is it possibl that
Amli” (Madmoisll Bourinn) “thinks I could b jalous of hr,
and not valu hr pur affction and dvotion to m?” Sh wnt up
to hr and kissd hr warmly. Anatol wnt up to kiss th littl
princss’ hand.
“No! No! No! Whn your fathr writs to tll m that you ar bhaving
wll I will giv you my hand to kiss. Not till thn!” sh said. And
smilingly raising a fingr at him, sh lft th room.
CHAPTR V
Thy all sparatd, but, xcpt Anatol who fll aslp as soon as h
got into bd, all kpt awak a long tim that night.
“Is h rally to b my husband, this strangr who is so kind—ys,
kind, that is th chif thing,” thought Princss Mary; and far, which
sh had sldom xprincd, cam upon hr. Sh fard to look round, it
smd to hr that somon was thr standing bhind th scrn in th
dark cornr. And this somon was h—th dvil—and h was also this
man with th whit forhad, black ybrows, and rd lips.
Sh rang for hr maid and askd hr to slp in hr room.
Madmoisll Bourinn walkd up and down th consrvatory for a long
tim that vning, vainly xpcting somon, now smiling at somon, now
working hrslf up to tars with th imaginary words of hr pauvr mèr
rbuking hr for hr fall.
Th littl princss grumbld to hr maid that hr bd was badly mad.
Sh could not li ithr on hr fac or on hr sid. vry position was
awkward and uncomfortabl, and hr burdn opprssd hr now mor than
vr bcaus Anatol’s prsnc had vividly rcalld to hr th tim
whn sh was not lik that and whn vrything was light and gay. Sh
sat in an armchair in hr drssing jackt and nightcap and Kati, slpy
and dishvld, bat and turnd th havy fathr bd for th third
tim, muttring to hrslf.
“I told you it was all lumps and hols!” th littl princss
rpatd. “I should b glad nough to fall aslp, so it’s not my
fault!” and hr voic quivrd lik that of a child about to cry.
Th old princ did not slp ithr. Tíkhon, half aslp, hard him
pacing angrily about and snorting. Th old princ flt as though h
had bn insultd through his daughtr. Th insult was th mor pointd
bcaus it concrnd not himslf but anothr, his daughtr, whom h
lovd mor than himslf. H kpt tlling himslf that h would considr
th whol mattr and dcid what was right and how h should act, but
instad of that h only xcitd himslf mor and mor.
“Th first man that turns up—sh forgts hr fathr and vrything
ls, runs upstairs and dos up hr hair and wags hr tail and is unlik
hrslf! Glad to throw hr fathr ovr! And sh knw I should notic
it. Fr... fr... fr! And don’t I s that that idiot had ys only for
Bourinn—I shall hav to gt rid of hr. And how is it sh has not
prid nough to s it? If sh has no prid for hrslf sh might at
last hav som for my sak! Sh must b shown that th blockhad thinks
nothing of hr and looks only at Bourinn. No, sh has no prid... but
I’ll lt hr s....”
Th old princ knw that if h told his daughtr sh was making a
mistak and that Anatol mant to flirt with Madmoisll Bourinn,
Princss Mary’s slf-stm would b woundd and his point (not to
b partd from hr) would b gaind, so pacifying himslf with this
thought, h calld Tíkhon and bgan to undrss.
“What dvil brought thm hr?” thought h, whil Tíkhon was
putting th nightshirt ovr his drid-up old body and gray-haird chst.
“I nvr invitd thm. Thy cam to disturb my lif—and thr is not
much of it lft.”
“Dvil tak ‘m!” h muttrd, whil his had was still covrd by
th shirt.
Tíkhon knw his mastr’s habit of somtims thinking aloud, and
thrfor mt with unaltrd looks th angrily inquisitiv xprssion of
th fac that mrgd from th shirt.
“Gon to bd?” askd th princ.
Tíkhon, lik all good valts, instinctivly knw th dirction of his
mastr’s thoughts. H gussd that th qustion rfrrd to Princ
Vasíli and his son.
“Thy hav gon to bd and put out thir lights, your xcllncy.”
“No good... no good...” said th princ rapidly, and thrusting his
ft into his slipprs and his arms into th slvs of his drssing
gown, h wnt to th couch on which h slpt.
Though no words had passd btwn Anatol and Madmoisll Bourinn,
thy quit undrstood on anothr as to th first part of thir romanc,
up to th apparanc of th pauvr mèr; thy undrstood that thy had
much to say to on anothr in privat and so thy had bn sking an
opportunity sinc morning to mt on anothr alon. Whn Princss Mary
wnt to hr fathr’s room at th usual hour, Madmoisll Bourinn
and Anatol mt in th consrvatory.
Princss Mary wnt to th door of th study with spcial trpidation.
It smd to hr that not only did vrybody know that hr fat would b
dcidd that day, but that thy also knw what sh thought about it. Sh
rad this in Tíkhon’s fac and in that of Princ Vasíli’s valt,
who mad hr a low bow whn sh mt him in th corridor carrying hot
watr.
Th old princ was vry affctionat and carful in his tratmnt of
his daughtr that morning. Princss Mary wll knw this painstaking
xprssion of hr fathr’s. His fac wor that xprssion whn his
dry hands clnchd with vxation at hr not undrstanding a sum in
arithmtic, whn rising from his chair h would walk away from hr,
rpating in a low voic th sam words svral tims ovr.
H cam to th point at onc, trating hr crmoniously.
“I hav had a proposition mad m concrning you,” h said with an
unnatural smil. “I xpct you hav gussd that Princ Vasíli has
not com and brought his pupil with him” (for som rason Princ
Bolkónski rfrrd to Anatol as a “pupil”) “for th sak of my
bautiful ys. Last night a proposition was mad m on your account
and, as you know my principls, I rfr it to you.”
“How am I to undrstand you, mon pèr?” said th princss, growing
pal and thn blushing.
“How undrstand m!” crid hr fathr angrily. “Princ Vasíli
finds you to his tast as a daughtr-in-law and maks a proposal to you
on his pupil’s bhalf. That’s how it’s to b undrstood! ‘How
undrstand it’!... And I ask you!”
“I do not know what you think, Fathr,” whisprd th princss.
“I? I? What of m? Lav m out of th qustion. I’m not going to
gt marrid. What about you? That’s what I want to know.”
Th princss saw that hr fathr rgardd th mattr with disapproval,
but at that momnt th thought occurrd to hr that hr fat would b
dcidd now or nvr. Sh lowrd hr ys so as not to s th gaz
undr which sh flt that sh could not think, but would only b abl to
submit from habit, and sh said: “I wish only to do your will, but if
I had to xprss my own dsir...” Sh had no tim to finish. Th old
princ intrruptd hr.
“That’s admirabl!” h shoutd. “H will tak you with your
dowry and tak Madmoisll Bourinn into th bargain. Sh’ll b th
wif, whil you...”
Th princ stoppd. H saw th ffct ths words had producd on his
daughtr. Sh lowrd hr had and was rady to burst into tars.
“Now thn, now thn, I’m only joking!” h said. “Rmmbr this,
Princss, I hold to th principl that a maidn has a full right to
choos. I giv you frdom. Only rmmbr that your lif’s happinss
dpnds on your dcision. Nvr mind m!”
“But I do not know, Fathr!”
“Thr’s no nd to talk! H rcivs his ordrs and will marry you
or anybody; but you ar fr to choos.... Go to your room, think it
ovr, and com back in an hour and tll m in his prsnc: ys or no.
I know you will pray ovr it. Wll, pray if you lik, but you had bttr
think it ovr. Go! Ys or no, ys or no, ys or no!” h still shoutd
whn th princss, as if lost in a fog, had alrady staggrd out of th
study.
Hr fat was dcidd and happily dcidd. But what hr fathr had said
about Madmoisll Bourinn was dradful. It was untru to b sur, but
still it was trribl, and sh could not hlp thinking of it. Sh was
going straight on through th consrvatory, nithr sing nor haring
anything, whn suddnly th wll-known whispring of Madmoisll
Bourinn arousd hr. Sh raisd hr ys, and two stps away saw
Anatol mbracing th Frnchwoman and whispring somthing to hr. With
a horrifid xprssion on his handsom fac, Anatol lookd at Princss
Mary, but did not at onc tak his arm from th waist of Madmoisll
Bourinn who had not yt sn hr.
“Who’s that? Why? Wait a momnt!” Anatol’s fac smd to say.
Princss Mary lookd at thm in silnc. Sh could not undrstand it. At
last Madmoisll Bourinn gav a scram and ran away. Anatol bowd to
Princss Mary with a gay smil, as if inviting hr to join in a laugh at
this strang incidnt, and thn shrugging his shouldrs wnt to th door
that ld to his own apartmnts.
An hour latr, Tíkhon cam to call Princss Mary to th old princ;
h addd that Princ Vasíli was also thr. Whn Tíkhon cam to hr
Princss Mary was sitting on th sofa in hr room, holding th wping
Madmoisll Bourinn in hr arms and gntly stroking hr hair. Th
princss’ bautiful ys with all thir formr calm radianc wr
looking with tndr affction and pity at Madmoisll Bourinn’s
prtty fac.
“No, Princss, I hav lost your affction forvr!” said
Madmoisll Bourinn.
“Why? I lov you mor than vr,” said Princss Mary, “and I will
try to do all I can for your happinss.”
“But you dspis m. You who ar so pur can nvr undrstand bing so
carrid away by passion. Oh, only my poor mothr...”
“I quit undrstand,” answrd Princss Mary, with a sad smil.
“Calm yourslf, my dar. I will go to my fathr,” sh said, and wnt
out.
Princ Vasíli, with on lg thrown high ovr th othr and a snuffbox
in his hand, was sitting thr with a smil of dp motion on his fac,
as if stirrd to his hart’s cor and himslf rgrtting and laughing
at his own snsibility, whn Princss Mary ntrd. H hurridly took a
pinch of snuff.
“Ah, my dar, my dar!” h bgan, rising and taking hr by both
hands. Thn, sighing, h addd: “My son’s fat is in your hands.
Dcid, my dar, good, gntl Mari, whom I hav always lovd as a
daughtr!”
H drw back and a ral tar appard in his y.
“Fr... fr...” snortd Princ Bolkónski. “Th princ is making a
proposition to you in his pupil’s—I man, his son’s—nam. Do you
wish or not to b Princ Anatol Kurágin’s wif? Rply: ys or no,”
h shoutd, “and thn I shall rsrv th right to stat my opinion
also. Ys, my opinion, and only my opinion,” addd Princ Bolkónski,
turning to Princ Vasíli and answring his imploring look. “Ys, or
no?”
“My dsir is nvr to lav you, Fathr, nvr to sparat my
lif from yours. I don’t wish to marry,” sh answrd positivly,
glancing at Princ Vasíli and at hr fathr with hr bautiful ys.
“Humbug! Nonsns! Humbug, humbug, humbug!” crid Princ Bolkónski,
frowning and taking his daughtr’s hand; h did not kiss hr, but only
bnding his forhad to hrs just touchd it, and prssd hr hand so
that sh wincd and uttrd a cry.
Princ Vasíli ros.
“My dar, I must tll you that this is a momnt I shall nvr, nvr
forgt. But, my dar, will you not giv us a littl hop of touching
this hart, so kind and gnrous? Say ‘prhaps’... Th futur is so
long. Say ‘prhaps.’”
“Princ, what I hav said is all thr is in my hart. I thank you for
th honor, but I shall nvr b your son’s wif.”
“Wll, so that’s finishd, my dar fllow! I am vry glad to hav
sn you. Vry glad! Go back to your rooms, Princss. Go!” said
th old princ. “Vry, vry glad to hav sn you,” rpatd h,
mbracing Princ Vasíli.
“My vocation is a diffrnt on,” thought Princss Mary. “My
vocation is to b happy with anothr kind of happinss, th happinss
of lov and slf-sacrific. And cost what it may, I will arrang
poor Amli’s happinss, sh lovs him so passionatly, and so
passionatly rpnts. I will do all I can to arrang th match btwn
thm. If h is not rich I will giv hr th mans; I will ask my
fathr and Andrw. I shall b so happy whn sh is his wif. Sh is so
unfortunat, a strangr, alon, hlplss! And, oh God, how passionatly
sh must lov him if sh could so far forgt hrslf! Prhaps I might
hav don th sam!...” thought Princss Mary.
CHAPTR VI
It was long sinc th Rostóvs had nws of Nicholas. Not till midwintr
was th count at last handd a lttr addrssd in his son’s
handwriting. On rciving it, h ran on tipto to his study in alarm and
hast, trying to scap notic, closd th door, and bgan to rad th
lttr.
Anna Mikháylovna, who always knw vrything that passd in th hous,
on haring of th arrival of th lttr wnt softly into th room and
found th count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at th sam
tim.
Anna Mikháylovna, though hr circumstancs had improvd, was still
living with th Rostóvs.
“My dar frind?” said sh, in a ton of pathtic inquiry, prpard
to sympathiz in any way.
Th count sobbd yt mor.
“Nikólnka... a lttr... wa... a... s... woundd... my darling
boy... th countss... promotd to b an officr... thank God... How
tll th littl countss!”
Anna Mikháylovna sat down bsid him, with hr own handkrchif wipd
th tars from his ys and from th lttr, thn having drid hr
own ys sh comfortd th count, and dcidd that at dinnr and till
tatim sh would prpar th countss, and aftr ta, with God’s
hlp, would inform hr.
At dinnr Anna Mikháylovna talkd th whol tim about th war nws
and about Nikólnka, twic askd whn th last lttr had bn rcivd
from him, though sh knw that alrady, and rmarkd that thy might
vry likly b gtting a lttr from him that day. ach tim that ths
hints bgan to mak th countss anxious and sh glancd unasily at
th count and at Anna Mikháylovna, th lattr vry adroitly turnd
th convrsation to insignificant mattrs. Natásha, who, of th whol
family, was th most giftd with a capacity to fl any shads of
intonation, look, and xprssion, prickd up hr ars from th bginning
of th mal and was crtain that thr was som scrt btwn hr
fathr and Anna Mikháylovna, that it had somthing to do with hr
brothr, and that Anna Mikháylovna was prparing thm for it. Bold as
sh was, Natásha, who knw how snsitiv hr mothr was to anything
rlating to Nikólnka, did not vntur to ask any qustions at dinnr,
but sh was too xcitd to at anything and kpt wriggling about on hr
chair rgardlss of hr govrnss’ rmarks. Aftr dinnr, sh rushd
hadlong aftr Anna Mikháylovna and, dashing at hr, flung hrslf on
hr nck as soon as sh ovrtook hr in th sitting room.
“Aunti, darling, do tll m what it is!”
“Nothing, my dar.”
“No, darst, swt on, hony, I won’t giv up—I know you know
somthing.”
Anna Mikháylovna shook hr had.
“You ar a littl slyboots,” sh said.
“A lttr from Nikólnka! I’m sur of it!” xclaimd Natásha,
rading confirmation in Anna Mikháylovna’s fac.
“But for God’s sak, b carful, you know how it may affct your
mamma.”
“I will, I will, only tll m! You won’t? Thn I will go and tll at
onc.”
Anna Mikháylovna, in a fw words, told hr th contnts of th lttr,
on condition that sh should tll no on.
“No, on my tru word of honor,” said Natásha, crossing hrslf,
“I won’t tll anyon!” and sh ran off at onc to Sónya.
“Nikólnka... woundd... a lttr,” sh announcd in glful
triumph.
“Nicholas!” was all Sónya said, instantly turning whit.
Natásha, sing th imprssion th nws of hr brothr’s wound
producd on Sónya, flt for th first tim th sorrowful sid of th
nws.
Sh rushd to Sónya, huggd hr, and bgan to cry.
“A littl wound, but h has bn mad an officr; h is wll now, h
wrot himslf,” said sh through hr tars.
“Thr now! It’s tru that all you womn ar crybabis,” rmarkd
Ptya, pacing th room with larg, rsolut strids. “Now I’m vry
glad, vry glad indd, that my brothr has distinguishd himslf so.
You ar all blubbrrs and undrstand nothing.”
Natásha smild through hr tars.
“You havn’t rad th lttr?” askd Sónya.
“No, but sh said that it was all ovr and that h’s now an
officr.”
“Thank God!” said Sónya, crossing hrslf. “But prhaps sh
dcivd you. Lt us go to Mamma.”
Ptya pacd th room in silnc for a tim.
“If I’d bn in Nikólnka’s plac I would hav killd vn mor
of thos Frnchmn,” h said. “What nasty bruts thy ar! I’d
hav killd so many that thr’d hav bn a hap of thm.”
“Hold your tongu, Ptya, what a goos you ar!”
“I’m not a goos, but thy ar who cry about trifls,” said
Ptya.
“Do you rmmbr him?” Natásha suddnly askd, aftr a momnt’s
silnc.
Sónya smild.
“Do I rmmbr Nicholas?”
“No, Sónya, but do you rmmbr so that you rmmbr him prfctly,
rmmbr vrything?” said Natásha, with an xprssiv gstur,
vidntly wishing to giv hr words a vry dfinit maning. “I
rmmbr Nikólnka too, I rmmbr him wll,” sh said. “But I
don’t rmmbr Borís. I don’t rmmbr him a bit.”
“What! You don’t rmmbr Borís?” askd Sónya in surpris.
“It’s not that I don’t rmmbr—I know what h is lik, but not
as I rmmbr Nikólnka. Him—I just shut my ys and rmmbr,
but Borís... No!” (Sh shut hr ys.) “No! thr’s nothing at
all.”
“Oh, Natásha!” said Sónya, looking cstatically and arnstly at
hr frind as if sh did not considr hr worthy to har what sh mant
to say and as if sh wr saying it to somon ls, with whom joking
was out of th qustion, “I am in lov with your brothr onc for all
and, whatvr may happn to him or to m, shall nvr cas to lov him
as long as I liv.”
Natásha lookd at Sónya with wondring and inquisitiv ys, and said
nothing. Sh flt that Sónya was spaking th truth, that thr was
such lov as Sónya was spaking of. But Natásha had not yt flt
anything lik it. Sh blivd it could b, but did not undrstand it.
“Shall you writ to him?” sh askd.
Sónya bcam thoughtful. Th qustion of how to writ to Nicholas, and
whthr sh ought to writ, tormntd hr. Now that h was alrady an
officr and a woundd hro, would it b right to rmind him of hrslf
and, as it might sm, of th obligations to hr h had takn on
himslf?
“I don’t know. I think if h writs, I will writ too,” sh said,
blushing.
“And you won’t fl ashamd to writ to him?”
Sónya smild.
“No.”
“And I should b ashamd to writ to Borís. I’m not going to.”
“Why should you b ashamd?”
“Wll, I don’t know. It’s awkward and would mak m ashamd.”
“And I know why sh’d b ashamd,” said Ptya, offndd by
Natásha’s prvious rmark. “It’s bcaus sh was in lov with
that fat on in spctacls” (that was how Ptya dscribd his
namsak, th nw Count Bzúkhov) “and now sh’s in lov with that
singr” (h mant Natásha’s Italian singing mastr), “that’s
why sh’s ashamd!”
“Ptya, you’r a stupid!” said Natásha.
“Not mor stupid than you, madam,” said th nin-yar-old Ptya,
with th air of an old brigadir.
Th countss had bn prpard by Anna Mikháylovna’s hints at dinnr.
On rtiring to hr own room, sh sat in an armchair, hr ys fixd on a
miniatur portrait of hr son on th lid of a snuffbox, whil th tars
kpt coming into hr ys. Anna Mikháylovna, with th lttr, cam on
tipto to th countss’ door and pausd.
“Don’t com in,” sh said to th old count who was following hr.
“Com latr.” And sh wnt in, closing th door bhind hr.
Th count put his ar to th kyhol and listnd.
At first h hard th sound of indiffrnt voics, thn Anna
Mikháylovna’s voic alon in a long spch, thn a cry, thn silnc,
thn both voics togthr with glad intonations, and thn footstps.
Anna Mikháylovna opnd th door. Hr fac wor th proud xprssion
of a surgon who has just prformd a difficult opration and admits th
public to apprciat his skill.
“It is don!” sh said to th count, pointing triumphantly to th
countss, who sat holding in on hand th snuffbox with its portrait and
in th othr th lttr, and prssing thm altrnatly to hr lips.
Whn sh saw th count, sh strtchd out hr arms to him, mbracd his
bald had, ovr which sh again lookd at th lttr and th portrait,
and in ordr to prss thm again to hr lips, sh slightly pushd away
th bald had. Vra, Natásha, Sónya, and Ptya now ntrd th room,
and th rading of th lttr bgan. Aftr a brif dscription of
th campaign and th two battls in which h had takn part, and his
promotion, Nicholas said that h kissd his fathr’s and mothr’s
hands asking for thir blssing, and that h kissd Vra, Natásha, and
Ptya. Bsids that, h snt grtings to Monsiur Schlling, Madam
Schoss, and his old nurs, and askd thm to kiss for him “dar
Sónya, whom h lovd and thought of just th sam as vr.” Whn sh
hard this Sónya blushd so that tars cam into hr ys and, unabl
to bar th looks turnd upon hr, ran away into th dancing hall,
whirld round it at full spd with hr drss puffd out lik a balloon,
and, flushd and smiling, plumpd down on th floor. Th countss was
crying.
“Why ar you crying, Mamma?” askd Vra. “From all h says on
should b glad and not cry.”
This was quit tru, but th count, th countss, and Natásha lookd
at hr rproachfully. “And who is it sh taks aftr?” thought th
countss.
Nicholas’ lttr was rad ovr hundrds of tims, and thos who wr
considrd worthy to har it had to com to th countss, for sh
did not lt it out of hr hands. Th tutors cam, and th nurss, and
Dmítri, and svral acquaintancs, and th countss rrad th lttr
ach tim with frsh plasur and ach tim discovrd in it frsh
proofs of Nikólnka’s virtus. How strang, how xtraordinary, how
joyful it smd, that hr son, th scarcly prcptibl motion of whos
tiny limbs sh had flt twnty yars ago within hr, that son about whom
sh usd to hav quarrls with th too indulgnt count, that son who
had first larnd to say “par” and thn “granny,” that this son
should now b away in a forign land amid strang surroundings, a manly
warrior doing som kind of man’s work of his own, without hlp or
guidanc. Th univrsal xprinc of ags, showing that childrn do
grow imprcptibly from th cradl to manhood, did not xist for th
countss. Hr son’s growth toward manhood, at ach of its stags,
had smd as xtraordinary to hr as if thr had nvr xistd th
millions of human bings who grw up in th sam way. As twnty
yars bfor, it smd impossibl that th littl cratur who livd
somwhr undr hr hart would vr cry, suck hr brast, and bgin to
spak, so now sh could not bliv that that littl cratur could b
this strong, brav man, this modl son and officr that, judging by this
lttr, h now was.
“What a styl! How charmingly h dscribs!” said sh, rading th
dscriptiv part of th lttr. “And what a soul! Not a word about

For mor than a wk prparations wr bing mad, rough drafts of
lttrs to Nicholas from all th houshold wr writtn and copid out,
whil undr th suprvision of th countss and th solicitud of th
count, mony and all things ncssary for th uniform and quipmnt
of th nwly commissiond officr wr collctd. Anna Mikháylovna,
practical woman that sh was, had vn managd by favor with army
authoritis to scur advantagous mans of communication for hrslf
and hr son. Sh had opportunitis of snding hr lttrs to th Grand
Duk Constantin Pávlovich, who commandd th Guards. Th Rostóvs
supposd that Th Russian Guards, Abroad, was quit a dfinit addrss,
and that if a lttr rachd th Grand Duk in command of th Guards
thr was no rason why it should not rach th Pávlograd rgimnt,
which was prsumably somwhr in th sam nighborhood. And so it was
dcidd to snd th lttrs and mony by th Grand Duk’s courir to
Borís and Borís was to forward thm to Nicholas. Th lttrs wr from
th old count, th countss, Ptya, Vra, Natásha, and Sónya, and
finally thr wr six thousand rubls for his outfit and various othr
things th old count snt to his son.
CHAPTR VII
On th twlfth of Novmbr, Kutúzov’s activ army, in camp bfor
Olmütz, was prparing to b rviwd nxt day by th two mprors—th
Russian and th Austrian. Th Guards, just arrivd from Russia, spnt
th night tn mils from Olmütz and nxt morning wr to com straight
to th rviw, raching th fild at Olmütz by tn o’clock.
That day Nicholas Rostóv rcivd a lttr from Borís, tlling him
that th Ismáylov rgimnt was quartrd for th night tn mils from
Olmütz and that h wantd to s him as h had a lttr and mony for
him. Rostóv was particularly in nd of mony now that th troops,
aftr thir activ srvic, wr stationd nar Olmütz and th camp
swarmd with wll-provisiond sutlrs and Austrian Jws offring
all sorts of tmpting wars. Th Pávlograds hld fast aftr fast,
clbrating awards thy had rcivd for th campaign, and mad
xpditions to Olmütz to visit a crtain Carolin th Hungarian,
who had rcntly opnd a rstaurant thr with girls as waitrsss.
Rostóv, who had just clbratd his promotion to a corntcy and bought
Dnísov’s hors, Bdouin, was in dbt all round, to his comrads and
th sutlrs. On rciving Borís’ lttr h rod with a fllow officr
to Olmütz, dind thr, drank a bottl of win, and thn st off alon
to th Guards’ camp to find his old playmat. Rostóv had not yt had
tim to gt his uniform. H had on a shabby cadt jackt, dcoratd with
a soldir’s cross, qually shabby cadt’s riding brchs lind with
worn lathr, and an officr’s sabr with a sword knot. Th Don hors
h was riding was on h had bought from a Cossack during th campaign,
and h wor a crumpld hussar cap stuck jauntily back on on sid of his
had. As h rod up to th camp h thought how h would imprss Borís
and all his comrads of th Guards by his apparanc—that of a
fighting hussar who had bn undr fir.
Th Guards had mad thir whol march as if on a plasur trip, parading
thir clanlinss and disciplin. Thy had com by asy stags, thir
knapsacks convyd on carts, and th Austrian authoritis had providd
xcllnt dinnrs for th officrs at vry halting plac. Th rgimnts
had ntrd and lft th town with thir bands playing, and by th Grand
Duk’s ordrs th mn had marchd all th way in stp (a practic on
which th Guards pridd thmslvs), th officrs on foot and at thir
propr posts. Borís had bn quartrd, and had marchd all th
way, with Brg who was alrady in command of a company. Brg, who had
obtaind his captaincy during th campaign, had gaind th confidnc of
his supriors by his promptitud and accuracy and had arrangd his mony
mattrs vry satisfactorily. Borís, during th campaign, had mad th
acquaintanc of many prsons who might prov usful to him, and by
a lttr of rcommndation h had brought from Pirr had bcom
acquaintd with Princ Andrw Bolkónski, through whom h hopd to
obtain a post on th commandr in chif’s staff. Brg and Borís,
having rstd aftr ystrday’s march, wr sitting, clan and natly
drssd, at a round tabl in th clan quartrs allottd to thm,
playing chss. Brg hld a smoking pip btwn his kns. Borís, in
th accurat way charactristic of him, was building a littl pyramid of
chssmn with his dlicat whit fingrs whil awaiting Brg’s mov,
and watchd his opponnt’s fac, vidntly thinking about th gam as
h always thought only of whatvr h was ngagd on.
“Wll, how ar you going to gt out of that?” h rmarkd.
“W’ll try to,” rplid Brg, touching a pawn and thn rmoving
his hand.
At that momnt th door opnd.
“Hr h is at last!” shoutd Rostóv. “And Brg too! Oh, you
ptisnfans, allay cushay dormir!” h xclaimd, imitating his Russian
nurs’s Frnch, at which h and Borís usd to laugh long ago.
“Dar m, how you hav changd!”
Borís ros to mt Rostóv, but in doing so did not omit to stady and
rplac som chssmn that wr falling. H was about to mbrac his
frind, but Nicholas avoidd him. With that pculiar fling of youth,
that drad of batn tracks, and wish to xprss itslf in a mannr
diffrnt from that of its ldrs which is oftn insincr, Nicholas
wishd to do somthing spcial on mting his frind. H wantd to pinch
him, push him, do anything but kiss him—a thing vrybody did. But
notwithstanding this, Borís mbracd him in a quit, frindly way and
kissd him thr tims.
Thy had not mt for narly half a yar and, bing at th ag whn young
mn tak thir first stps on lif’s road, ach saw immns changs in
th othr, quit a nw rflction of th socity in which thy had takn
thos first stps. Both had changd gratly sinc thy last mt and both
wr in a hurry to show th changs that had takn plac in thm.
“Oh, you damnd dandis! Clan and frsh as if you’d bn to a ft,
not lik us sinnrs of th lin,” crid Rostóv, with martial swaggr
and with bariton nots in his voic, nw to Borís, pointing to his own
mud-bspattrd brchs. Th Grman landlady, haring Rostóv’s loud
voic, poppd hr had in at th door.
“h, is sh prtty?” h askd with a wink.
“Why do you shout so? You’ll frightn thm!” said Borís. “I did
not xpct you today,” h addd. “I only snt you th not ystrday
by Bolkónski—an adjutant of Kutúzov’s, who’s a frind of min.
I did not think h would gt it to you so quickly.... Wll, how ar you?
Bn undr fir alrady?” askd Borís.
Without answring, Rostóv shook th soldir’s Cross of St. Gorg
fastnd to th cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandagd arm,
glancd at Brg with a smil.
“As you s,” h said.
“Indd? Ys, ys!” said Borís, with a smil. “And w too hav
had a splndid march. You know, of cours, that His Imprial Highnss
rod with our rgimnt all th tim, so that w had vry comfort and
vry advantag. What rcptions w had in Poland! What dinnrs and
balls! I can’t tll you. And th Tsarvich was vry gracious to all
our officrs.”
And th two frinds told ach othr of thir doings, th on of his
hussar rvls and lif in th fighting lin, th othr of th plasurs
and advantags of srvic undr mmbrs of th Imprial family.
“Oh, you Guards!” said Rostóv. “I say, snd for som win.”
Borís mad a grimac.
“If you rally want it,” said h.
H wnt to his bd, drw a purs from undr th clan pillow, and snt
for win.
“Ys, and I hav som mony and a lttr to giv you,” h addd.
Rostóv took th lttr and, throwing th mony on th sofa, put both
arms on th tabl and bgan to rad. Aftr rading a fw lins, h
glancd angrily at Brg, thn, mting his ys, hid his fac bhind th
lttr.
“Wll, thy’v snt you a tidy sum,” said Brg, ying th havy
purs that sank into th sofa. “As for us, Count, w gt along on our
pay. I can tll you for myslf...”
“I say, Brg, my dar fllow,” said Rostóv, “whn you gt a
lttr from hom and mt on of your own popl whom you want to talk
vrything ovr with, and I happn to b thr, I’ll go at onc, to
b out of your way! Do go somwhr, anywhr... to th dvil!” h
xclaimd, and immdiatly sizing him by th shouldr and looking
amiably into his fac, vidntly wishing to softn th rudnss of his
words, h addd, “Don’t b hurt, my dar fllow; you know I spak
from my hart as to an old acquaintanc.”
“Oh, don’t mntion it, Count! I quit undrstand,” said Brg,
gtting up and spaking in a muffld and guttural voic.
“Go across to our hosts: thy invitd you,” addd Borís.
Brg put on th clanst of coats, without a spot or spck of dust,
stood bfor a looking glass and brushd th hair on his tmpls
upwards, in th way affctd by th mpror Alxandr, and, having
assurd himslf from th way Rostóv lookd at it that his coat had bn
noticd, lft th room with a plasant smil.
“Oh dar, what a bast I am!” muttrd Rostóv, as h rad th
lttr.
“Why?”
“Oh, what a pig I am, not to hav writtn and to hav givn thm
such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!” h rpatd, flushing suddnly.
“Wll, hav you snt Gabril for som win? All right lt’s hav
som!”
In th lttr from his parnts was nclosd a lttr of rcommndation
to Bagratión which th old countss at Anna Mikháylovna’s advic had
obtaind through an acquaintanc and snt to hr son, asking him to tak
it to its dstination and mak us of it.
“What nonsns! Much I nd it!” said Rostóv, throwing th lttr
undr th tabl.
“Why hav you thrown that away?” askd Borís.
“It is som lttr of rcommndation... what th dvil do I want it
for!”
“Why ‘What th dvil’?” said Borís, picking it up and rading
th addrss. “This lttr would b of grat us to you.”
“I want nothing, and I won’t b anyon’s adjutant.”
“Why not?” inquird Borís.
“It’s a lacky’s job!”
“You ar still th sam dramr, I s,” rmarkd Borís, shaking
his had.
“And you’r still th sam diplomatist! But that’s not th
point... Com, how ar you?” askd Rostóv.
“Wll, as you s. So far vrything’s all right, but I confss I
should much lik to b an adjutant and not rmain at th front.”
“Why?”
“Bcaus whn onc a man starts on military srvic, h should try to
mak as succssful a carr of it as possibl.”
“Oh, that’s it!” said Rostóv, vidntly thinking of somthing
ls.
H lookd intntly and inquiringly into his frind’s ys, vidntly
trying in vain to find th answr to som qustion.
Old Gabril brought in th win.
“Shouldn’t w now snd for Brg?” askd Borís. “H would drink
with you. I can’t.”
“Wll, snd for him... and how do you gt on with that Grman?”
askd Rostóv, with a contmptuous smil.
“H is a vry, vry nic, honst, and plasant fllow,” answrd
Borís.
Again Rostóv lookd intntly into Borís’ ys and sighd. Brg
rturnd, and ovr th bottl of win convrsation btwn th thr
officrs bcam animatd. Th Guardsmn told Rostóv of thir march and
how thy had bn mad much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. Thy spok
of th sayings and doings of thir commandr, th Grand Duk, and told
storis of his kindnss and irascibility. Brg, as usual, kpt silnt
whn th subjct did not rlat to himslf, but in connction with th
storis of th Grand Duk’s quick tmpr h rlatd with gusto how in
Galicia h had managd to dal with th Grand Duk whn th lattr
mad a tour of th rgimnts and was annoyd at th irrgularity of
a movmnt. With a plasant smil Brg rlatd how th Grand Duk
had riddn up to him in a violnt passion, shouting: “Arnauts!”
(“Arnauts” was th Tsarvich’s favorit xprssion whn h was in
a rag) and calld for th company commandr.
“Would you bliv it, Count, I was not at all alarmd, bcaus I knw
I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know th Army
Ordrs by hart and know th Rgulations as wll as I do th Lord’s
Prayr. So, Count, thr nvr is any nglignc in my company, and
so my conscinc was at as. I cam forward....” (Brg stood up and
showd how h prsntd himslf, with his hand to his cap, and rally
it would hav bn difficult for a fac to xprss gratr rspct and
slf-complacncy than his did.) “Wll, h stormd at m, as th saying
is, stormd and stormd and stormd! It was not a mattr of lif but
rathr of dath, as th saying is. ‘Albanians!’ and ‘dvils!’
and ‘To Sibria!’” said Brg with a sagacious smil. “I knw I
was in th right so I kpt silnt; was not that bst, Count?... ‘Hy,
ar you dumb?’ h shoutd. Still I rmaind silnt. And what do you
think, Count? Th nxt day it was not vn mntiond in th Ordrs of
th Day. That’s what kping on’s had mans. That’s th way,
Count,” said Brg, lighting his pip and mitting rings of smok.
“Ys, that was fin,” said Rostóv, smiling.
But Borís noticd that h was prparing to mak fun of Brg, and
skillfully changd th subjct. H askd him to tll thm how and whr
h got his wound. This plasd Rostóv and h bgan talking about it,
and as h wnt on bcam mor and mor animatd. H told thm of his
Schön Grabrn affair, just as thos who hav takn part in a battl
gnrally do dscrib it, that is, as thy would lik it to hav bn,
as thy hav hard it dscribd by othrs, and as sounds wll, but not
at all as it rally was. Rostóv was a truthful young man and would on
no account hav told a dlibrat li. H bgan his story maning to
tll vrything just as it happnd, but imprcptibly, involuntarily,
and invitably h lapsd into falshood. If h had told th truth to his
harrs—who lik himslf had oftn hard storis of attacks and had
formd a dfinit ida of what an attack was and wr xpcting to har
just such a story—thy would ithr not hav blivd him or, still
wors, would hav thought that Rostóv was himslf to blam sinc what
gnrally happns to th narrators of cavalry attacks had not happnd
to him. H could not tll thm simply that vryon wnt at a trot and
that h fll off his hors and spraind his arm and thn ran as hard as
h could from a Frnchman into th wood. Bsids, to tll vrything as
it rally happnd, it would hav bn ncssary to mak an ffort of
will to tll only what happnd. It is vry difficult to tll th truth,
and young popl ar rarly capabl of it. His harrs xpctd a story
of how bsid himslf and all aflam with xcitmnt, h had flown lik
a storm at th squar, cut his way in, slashd right and lft, how his
sabr had tastd flsh and h had falln xhaustd, and so on. And so h
told thm all that.
In th middl of his story, just as h was saying: “You cannot imagin
what a strang frnzy on xprincs during an attack,” Princ
Andrw, whom Borís was xpcting, ntrd th room. Princ Andrw, who
likd to hlp young mn, was flattrd by bing askd for his assistanc
and bing wll disposd toward Borís, who had managd to plas him th
day bfor, h wishd to do what th young man wantd. Having bn snt
with paprs from Kutúzov to th Tsarvich, h lookd in on Borís,
hoping to find him alon. Whn h cam in and saw an hussar of th lin
rcounting his military xploits (Princ Andrw could not ndur
that sort of man), h gav Borís a plasant smil, frownd as with
half-closd ys h lookd at Rostóv, bowd slightly and warily, and
sat down languidly on th sofa: h flt it unplasant to hav droppd
in on bad company. Rostóv flushd up on noticing this, but h did not
car, this was a mr strangr. Glancing, howvr, at Borís, h saw
that h too smd ashamd of th hussar of th lin.
In spit of Princ Andrw’s disagrabl, ironical ton, in spit of
th contmpt with which Rostóv, from his fighting army point of viw,
rgardd all ths littl adjutants on th staff of whom th nwcomr
was vidntly on, Rostóv flt confusd, blushd, and bcam silnt.
Borís inquird what nws thr might b on th staff, and what, without
indiscrtion, on might ask about our plans.
“W shall probably advanc,” rplid Bolkónski, vidntly rluctant
to say mor in th prsnc of a strangr.
Brg took th opportunity to ask, with grat politnss, whthr, as was
rumord, th allowanc of forag mony to captains of companis would b
doubld. To this Princ Andrw answrd with a smil that h could
giv no opinion on such an important govrnmnt ordr, and Brg laughd
gaily.
“As to your businss,” Princ Andrw continud, addrssing Borís,
“w will talk of it latr” (and h lookd round at Rostóv). “Com
to m aftr th rviw and w will do what is possibl.”
And, having glancd round th room, Princ Andrw turnd to Rostóv,
whos stat of unconqurabl childish mbarrassmnt now changing to
angr h did not condscnd to notic, and said: “I think you wr
talking of th Schön Grabrn affair? Wr you thr?”
“I was thr,” said Rostóv angrily, as if intnding to insult th
aid-d-camp.
Bolkónski noticd th hussar’s stat of mind, and it amusd him. With
a slightly contmptuous smil, h said: “Ys, thr ar many storis
now told about that affair!”
“Ys, storis!” rpatd Rostóv loudly, looking with ys suddnly
grown furious, now at Borís, now at Bolkónski. “Ys, many storis!
But our storis ar th storis of mn who hav bn undr th nmy’s
fir! Our storis hav som wight, not lik th storis of thos
fllows on th staff who gt rwards without doing anything!”
“Of whom you imagin m to b on?” said Princ Andrw, with a quit
and particularly amiabl smil.
A strang fling of xaspration and yt of rspct for this man’s
slf-possssion mingld at that momnt in Rostóv’s soul.
“I am not talking about you,” h said, “I don’t know you and,
frankly, I don’t want to. I am spaking of th staff in gnral.”
“And I will tll you this,” Princ Andrw intrruptd in a ton of
quit authority, “you wish to insult m, and I am rady to agr with
you that it would b vry asy to do so if you havn’t sufficint
slf-rspct, but admit that th tim and plac ar vry badly chosn.
In a day or two w shall all hav to tak part in a gratr and mor
srious dul, and bsids, Drubtskóy, who says h is an old frind
of yours, is not at all to blam that my fac has th misfortun to
displas you. Howvr,” h addd rising, “you know my nam and
whr to find m, but don’t forgt that I do not rgard ithr myslf
or you as having bn at all insultd, and as a man oldr than you, my
advic is to lt th mattr drop. Wll thn, on Friday aftr th rviw
I shall xpct you, Drubtskóy. Au rvoir!” xclaimd Princ Andrw,
and with a bow to thm both h wnt out.
Only whn Princ Andrw was gon did Rostóv think of what h ought to
hav said. And h was still mor angry at having omittd to say it. H
ordrd his hors at onc and, coldly taking lav of Borís, rod
hom. Should h go to hadquartrs nxt day and challng that affctd
adjutant, or rally lt th mattr drop, was th qustion that worrid
him all th way. H thought angrily of th plasur h would hav at
sing th fright of that small and frail but proud man whn covrd by
his pistol, and thn h flt with surpris that of all th mn h knw
thr was non h would so much lik to hav for a frind as that vry
adjutant whom h so hatd.
CHAPTR VIII
Th day aftr Rostóv had bn to s Borís, a rviw was hld of th
Austrian and Russian troops, both thos frshly arrivd from Russia and
thos who had bn campaigning undr Kutúzov. Th two mprors,
th Russian with his hir th Tsarvich, and th Austrian with th
Archduk, inspctd th allid army of ighty thousand mn.
From arly morning th smart clan troops wr on th mov, forming up
on th fild bfor th fortrss. Now thousands of ft and bayonts
movd and haltd at th officrs’ command, turnd with bannrs flying,
formd up at intrvals, and whld round othr similar masss of
infantry in diffrnt uniforms; now was hard th rhythmic bat of
hoofs and th jingling of showy cavalry in blu, rd, and grn braidd
uniforms, with smartly drssd bandsmn in front mountd on black, roan,
or gray horss; thn again, sprading out with th brazn clattr of th
polishd shining cannon that quivrd on th gun carriags and with
th smll of linstocks, cam th artillry which crawld btwn th
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointd position. Not only th
gnrals in full parad uniforms, with thir thin or thick waists drawn
in to th utmost, thir rd ncks squzd into thir stiff collars, and
waring scarvs and all thir dcorations, not only th lgant, pomadd
officrs, but vry soldir with his frshly washd and shavn fac and
his wapons clan and polishd to th utmost, and vry hors groomd
till its coat shon lik satin and vry hair of its wttd man lay
smooth—flt that no small mattr was happning, but an important and
solmn affair. vry gnral and vry soldir was conscious of his own
insignificanc, awar of bing but a drop in that ocan of mn, and
yt at th sam tim was conscious of his strngth as a part of that
normous whol.
From arly morning strnuous activitis and fforts had bgun and by tn
o’clock all had bn brought into du ordr. Th ranks wr drawn
up on th vast fild. Th whol army was xtndd in thr lins: th
cavalry in front, bhind it th artillry, and bhind that again th
infantry.
A spac lik a strt was lft btwn ach two lins of troops. Th
thr parts of that army wr sharply distinguishd: Kutúzov’s
fighting army (with th Pávlograds on th right flank of th front);
thos rcntly arrivd from Russia, both Guards and rgimnts of th
lin; and th Austrian troops. But thy all stood in th sam lins,
undr on command, and in a lik ordr.
Lik wind ovr lavs ran an xcitd whispr: “Thy’r coming!
Thy’r coming!” Alarmd voics wr hard, and a stir of final
prparation swpt ovr all th troops.
From th dirction of Olmütz in front of thm, a group was sn
approaching. And at that momnt, though th day was still, a light gust
of wind blowing ovr th army slightly stirrd th stramrs on th
lancs and th unfoldd standards fluttrd against thir staffs. It
lookd as if by that slight motion th army itslf was xprssing its
joy at th approach of th mprors. On voic was hard shouting:
“ys front!” Thn, lik th crowing of cocks at sunris, this was
rpatd by othrs from various sids and all bcam silnt.
In th dathlik stillnss only th tramp of horss was hard. This
was th mprors’ suits. Th mprors rod up to th flank, and th
trumpts of th first cavalry rgimnt playd th gnral march. It
smd as though not th trumptrs wr playing, but as if th army
itslf, rjoicing at th mprors’ approach, had naturally burst into
music. Amid ths sounds, only th youthful kindly voic of th mpror
Alxandr was clarly hard. H gav th words of grting, and th
first rgimnt roard “Hurrah!” so dafningly, continuously, and
joyfully that th mn thmslvs wr awd by thir multitud and th
immnsity of th powr thy constitutd.
Rostóv, standing in th front lins of Kutúzov’s army which th Tsar
approachd first, xprincd th sam fling as vry othr man in
that army: a fling of slf-forgtfulnss, a proud consciousnss of
might, and a passionat attraction to him who was th caus of this
triumph.
H flt that at a singl word from that man all this vast mass (and h
himslf an insignificant atom in it) would go through fir and watr,
commit crim, di, or prform dds of highst hroism, and so h could
not but trmbl and his hart stand still at th imminnc of that word.
“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” thundrd from all sids, on rgimnt
aftr anothr grting th Tsar with th strains of th march, and thn
“Hurrah!”... Thn th gnral march, and again “Hurrah! Hurrah!”
growing vr strongr and fullr and mrging into a dafning roar.
Till th Tsar rachd it, ach rgimnt in its silnc and immobility
smd lik a liflss body, but as soon as h cam up it bcam aliv,
its thundr joining th roar of th whol lin along which h had
alrady passd. Through th trribl and dafning roar of thos voics,
amid th squar masss of troops standing motionlss as if turnd to
ston, hundrds of ridrs composing th suits movd carlssly but
symmtrically and abov all frly, and in front of thm two mn—th
mprors. Upon thm th undividd, tnsly passionat attntion of that
whol mass of mn was concntratd.
Th handsom young mpror Alxandr, in th uniform of th Hors
Guards, waring a cockd hat with its paks front and back, with his
plasant fac and rsonant though not loud voic, attractd vryon’s
attntion.
Rostóv was not far from th trumptrs, and with his kn sight had
rcognizd th Tsar and watchd his approach. Whn h was within twnty
pacs, and Nicholas could clarly distinguish vry dtail of his
handsom, happy young fac, h xprincd a fling of tndrnss
and cstasy such as h had nvr bfor known. vry trait and vry
movmnt of th Tsar’s smd to him nchanting.
Stopping in front of th Pávlograds, th Tsar said somthing in Frnch
to th Austrian mpror and smild.
Sing that smil, Rostóv involuntarily smild himslf and flt a still
strongr flow of lov for his sovrign. H longd to show that lov in
som way and knowing that this was impossibl was rady to cry. Th Tsar
calld th colonl of th rgimnt and said a fw words to him.
“Oh God, what would happn to m if th mpror spok to m?”
thought Rostóv. “I should di of happinss!”
Th Tsar addrssd th officrs also: “I thank you all, gntlmn, I
thank you with my whol hart.” To Rostóv vry word soundd lik a
voic from havn. How gladly would h hav did at onc for his Tsar!
“You hav arnd th St. Gorg’s standards and will b worthy of
thm.”
“Oh, to di, to di for him,” thought Rostóv.
Th Tsar said somthing mor which Rostóv did not har, and th
soldirs, straining thir lungs, shoutd “Hurrah!”
Rostóv too, bnding ovr his saddl, shoutd “Hurrah!” with all his
might, fling that h would lik to injur himslf by that shout, if
only to xprss his raptur fully.
Th Tsar stoppd a fw minuts in front of th hussars as if undcidd.
“How can th mpror b undcidd?” thought Rostóv, but thn vn
this indcision appard to him majstic and nchanting, lik vrything
ls th Tsar did.
That hsitation lastd only an instant. Th Tsar’s foot, in th narrow
pointd boot thn fashionabl, touchd th groin of th bobtaild bay
mar h rod, his hand in a whit glov gathrd up th rins, and h
movd off accompanid by an irrgularly swaying sa of aids-d-camp.
Farthr and farthr h rod away, stopping at othr rgimnts, till at
last only his whit plums wr visibl to Rostóv from amid th suits
that surroundd th mprors.
Among th gntlmn of th suit, Rostóv noticd Bolkónski, sitting
his hors indolntly and carlssly. Rostóv rcalld thir quarrl of
ystrday and th qustion prsntd itslf whthr h ought or ought
not to challng Bolkónski. “Of cours not!” h now thought. “Is
it worth thinking or spaking of it at such a momnt? At a tim of such
lov, such raptur, and such slf-sacrific, what do any of our quarrls
and affronts mattr? I lov and forgiv vrybody now.”
Whn th mpror had passd narly all th rgimnts, th troops bgan
a crmonial march past him, and Rostóv on Bdouin, rcntly purchasd
from Dnísov, rod past too, at th rar of his squadron—that is,
alon and in full viw of th mpror.
Bfor h rachd him, Rostóv, who was a splndid horsman, spurrd
Bdouin twic and succssfully put him to th showy trot in which th
animal wnt whn xcitd. Bnding his foaming muzzl to his chst, his
tail xtndd, Bdouin, as if also conscious of th mpror’s y
upon him, passd splndidly, lifting his ft with a high and gracful
action, as if flying through th air without touching th ground.
Rostóv himslf, his lgs wll back and his stomach drawn in and fling
himslf on with his hors, rod past th mpror with a frowning but
blissful fac “lik a vwy dvil,” as Dnísov xprssd it.
“Fin fllows, th Pávlograds!” rmarkd th mpror.
“My God, how happy I should b if h ordrd m to lap into th fir
this instant!” thought Rostóv.
Whn th rviw was ovr, th nwly arrivd officrs, and also
Kutúzov’s, collctd in groups and bgan to talk about th awards,
about th Austrians and thir uniforms, about thir lins, about
Bonapart, and how badly th lattr would far now, spcially if th
ssn corps arrivd and Prussia took our sid.
But th talk in vry group was chifly about th mpror Alxandr. His
vry word and movmnt was dscribd with cstasy.
Thy all had but on wish: to advanc as soon as possibl against th
nmy undr th mpror’s command. Commandd by th mpror himslf
thy could not fail to vanquish anyon, b it whom it might: so thought
Rostóv and most of th officrs aftr th rviw.
All wr thn mor confidnt of victory than th winning of two battls
would hav mad thm.
CHAPTR IX
Th day aftr th rviw, Borís, in his bst uniform and with his
comrad Brg’s bst wishs for succss, rod to Olmütz to s
Bolkónski, wishing to profit by his frindlinss and obtain for himslf
th bst post h could—prfrably that of adjutant to som important
prsonag, a position in th army which smd to him most attractiv.
“It is all vry wll for Rostóv, whos fathr snds him tn thousand
rubls at a tim, to talk about not wishing to cring to anybody and not
b anyon’s lacky, but I who hav nothing but my brains hav to
mak a carr and must not miss opportunitis, but must avail myslf of
thm!” h rflctd.
H did not find Princ Andrw in Olmütz that day, but th apparanc of
th town whr th hadquartrs and th diplomatic corps wr stationd
and th two mprors wr living with thir suits, housholds, and
courts only strngthnd his dsir to blong to that highr world.
H knw no on, and dspit his smart Guardsman’s uniform, all ths
xaltd prsonags passing in th strts in thir lgant carriags
with thir plums, ribbons, and mdals, both courtirs and military
mn, smd so immasurably abov him, an insignificant officr of th
Guards, that thy not only did not wish to, but simply could not, b
awar of his xistnc. At th quartrs of th commandr in chif,
Kutúzov, whr h inquird for Bolkónski, all th adjutants and vn
th ordrlis lookd at him as if thy wishd to imprss on him that a
grat many officrs lik him wr always coming thr and that vrybody
was hartily sick of thm. In spit of this, or rathr bcaus of
it, nxt day, Novmbr 15, aftr dinnr h again wnt to Olmütz and,
ntring th hous occupid by Kutúzov, askd for Bolkónski. Princ
Andrw was in and Borís was shown into a larg hall probably formrly
usd for dancing, but in which fiv bds now stood, and furnitur of
various kinds: a tabl, chairs, and a clavichord. On adjutant, narst
th door, was sitting at th tabl in a Prsian drssing gown, writing.
Anothr, th rd, stout Nsvítski, lay on a bd with his arms undr his
had, laughing with an officr who had sat down bsid him. A third was
playing a Vinns waltz on th clavichord, whil a fourth, lying on
th clavichord, sang th tun. Bolkónski was not thr. Non of ths
gntlmn changd his position on sing Borís. Th on who was writing
and whom Borís addrssd turnd round crossly and told him Bolkónski
was on duty and that h should go through th door on th lft into th
rcption room if h wishd to s him. Borís thankd him and wnt to
th rcption room, whr h found som tn officrs and gnrals.
Whn h ntrd, Princ Andrw, his ys drooping contmptuously (with
that pculiar xprssion of polit warinss which plainly says, “If
it wr not my duty I would not talk to you for a momnt”), was
listning to an old Russian gnral with dcorations, who stood vry
rct, almost on tipto, with a soldir’s obsquious xprssion on his
purpl fac, rporting somthing.
“Vry wll, thn, b so good as to wait,” said Princ Andrw to th
gnral, in Russian, spaking with th Frnch intonation h affctd
whn h wishd to spak contmptuously, and noticing Borís, Princ
Andrw, paying no mor hd to th gnral who ran aftr him imploring
him to har somthing mor, noddd and turnd to him with a chrful
smil.
At that momnt Borís clarly ralizd what h had bfor surmisd, that
in th army, bsids th subordination and disciplin prscribd in th
military cod, which h and th othrs knw in th rgimnt, thr was
anothr, mor important, subordination, which mad this tight-lacd,
purpl-facd gnral wait rspctfully whil Captain Princ Andrw, for
his own plasur, chos to chat with Liutnant Drubtskóy. Mor than
vr was Borís rsolvd to srv in futur not according to th writtn
cod, but undr this unwrittn law. H flt now that mrly by having
bn rcommndd to Princ Andrw h had alrady risn abov th gnral
who at th front had th powr to annihilat him, a liutnant of th
Guards. Princ Andrw cam up to him and took his hand.
“I am vry sorry you did not find m in ystrday. I was fussing about
with Grmans all day. W wnt with Wyrothr to survy th dispositions.
Whn Grmans start bing accurat, thr’s no nd to it!”
Borís smild, as if h undrstood what Princ Andrw was alluding to
as somthing gnrally known. But it was th first tim h had hard
Wyrothr’s nam, or vn th trm “dispositions.”
“Wll, my dar fllow, so you still want to b an adjutant? I hav
bn thinking about you.”
“Ys, I was thinking”—for som rason Borís could not hlp
blushing—“of asking th commandr in chif. H has had a lttr from
Princ Kurágin about m. I only wantd to ask bcaus I far th Guards
won’t b in action,” h addd as if in apology.
“All right, all right. W’ll talk it ovr,” rplid Princ Andrw.
“Only lt m rport this gntlman’s businss, and I shall b at
your disposal.”
Whil Princ Andrw wnt to rport about th purpl-facd gnral, that
gntlman—vidntly not sharing Borís’ concption of th advantags
of th unwrittn cod of subordination—lookd so fixdly at th
prsumptuous liutnant who had prvntd his finishing what h had to
say to th adjutant that Borís flt uncomfortabl. H turnd away and
waitd impatintly for Princ Andrw’s rturn from th commandr in
chif’s room.
“You s, my dar fllow, I hav bn thinking about you,”
said Princ Andrw whn thy had gon into th larg room whr th
clavichord was. “It’s no us your going to th commandr in chif.
H would say a lot of plasant things, ask you to dinnr” (“That
would not b bad as rgards th unwrittn cod,” thought Borís),
“but nothing mor would com of it. Thr will soon b a battalion of
us aids-d-camp and adjutants! But this is what w’ll do: I hav
a good frind, an adjutant gnral and an xcllnt fllow, Princ
Dolgorúkov; and though you may not know it, th fact is that now
Kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. vrything is
now cntrd round th mpror. So w will go to Dolgorúkov; I hav to
go thr anyhow and I hav alrady spokn to him about you. W shall
s whthr h cannot attach you to himslf or find a plac for you
somwhr narr th sun.”
Princ Andrw always bcam spcially kn whn h had to guid a young
man and hlp him to worldly succss. Undr covr of obtaining hlp
of this kind for anothr, which from prid h would nvr accpt for
himslf, h kpt in touch with th circl which confrs succss and
which attractd him. H vry radily took up Borís’ caus and wnt
with him to Dolgorúkov.
It was lat in th vning whn thy ntrd th palac at Olmütz
occupid by th mprors and thir rtinus.
That sam day a council of war had bn hld in which all th mmbrs of
th Hofkrigsrath and both mprors took part. At that council, contrary
to th viws of th old gnrals Kutúzov and Princ Schwartznbrg, it
had bn dcidd to advanc immdiatly and giv battl to Bonapart.
Th council of war was just ovr whn Princ Andrw accompanid
by Borís arrivd at th palac to find Dolgorúkov. vryon at
hadquartrs was still undr th spll of th day’s council, at which
th party of th young had triumphd. Th voics of thos who counsld
dlay and advisd waiting for somthing ls bfor advancing had bn
so compltly silncd and thir argumnts confutd by such conclusiv
vidnc of th advantags of attacking that what had bn discussd
at th council—th coming battl and th victory that would crtainly
rsult from it—no longr smd to b in th futur but in th past.
All th advantags wr on our sid. Our normous forcs, undoubtdly
suprior to Napolon’s, wr concntratd in on plac, th troops
inspird by th mprors’ prsnc wr agr for action. Th
stratgic position whr th oprations would tak plac was familiar in
all its dtails to th Austrian Gnral Wyrothr: a lucky accidnt had
ordaind that th Austrian army should manuvr th prvious yar on th
vry filds whr th Frnch had now to b fought; th adjacnt
locality was known and shown in vry dtail on th maps, and Bonapart,
vidntly waknd, was undrtaking nothing.
Dolgorúkov, on of th warmst advocats of an attack, had just
rturnd from th council, tird and xhaustd but agr and proud
of th victory that had bn gaind. Princ Andrw introducd his
protg, but Princ Dolgorúkov politly and firmly prssing his hand
said nothing to Borís and, vidntly unabl to supprss th thoughts
which wr upprmost in his mind at that momnt, addrssd Princ Andrw
in Frnch.
“Ah, my dar fllow, what a battl w hav gaind! God grant that
th on that will rsult from it will b as victorious! Howvr, dar
fllow,” h said abruptly and agrly, “I must confss to having
bn unjust to th Austrians and spcially to Wyrothr. What
xactitud, what minutnss, what knowldg of th locality, what
forsight for vry vntuality, vry possibility vn to th smallst
dtail! No, my dar fllow, no conditions bttr than our prsnt ons
could hav bn dvisd. This combination of Austrian prcision with
Russian valor—what mor could b wishd for?”
“So th attack is dfinitly rsolvd on?” askd Bolkónski.
“And do you know, my dar fllow, it sms to m that Bonapart has
dciddly lost barings, you know that a lttr was rcivd from him
today for th mpror.” Dolgorúkov smild significantly.
“Is that so? And what did h say?” inquird Bolkónski.
“What can h say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... mrly to gain tim.
I tll you h is in our hands, that’s crtain! But what was most
amusing,” h continud, with a suddn, good-naturd laugh, “was that
w could not think how to addrss th rply! If not as ‘Consul’
and of cours not as ‘mpror,’ it smd to m it should b to
‘Gnral Bonapart.’”
“But btwn not rcognizing him as mpror and calling him Gnral
Bonapart, thr is a diffrnc,” rmarkd Bolkónski.
“That’s just it,” intrruptd Dolgorúkov quickly, laughing.
“You know Bilíbin—h’s a vry clvr fllow. H suggstd
addrssing him as ‘Usurpr and nmy of Mankind.’”
Dolgorúkov laughd mrrily.
“Only that?” said Bolkónski.
“All th sam, it was Bilíbin who found a suitabl form for th
addrss. H is a wis and clvr fllow.”
“What was it?”
“To th Had of th Frnch Govrnmnt... Au chf du gouvrnmnt
français,” said Dolgorúkov, with grav satisfaction. “Good,
wasn’t it?”
“Ys, but h will dislik it xtrmly,” said Bolkónski.
“Oh ys, vry much! My brothr knows him, h’s dind with him—th
prsnt mpror—mor than onc in Paris, and tlls m h nvr mt a
mor cunning or subtl diplomatist—you know, a combination of Frnch
adroitnss and Italian play-acting! Do you know th tal about him and
Count Markóv? Count Markóv was th only man who knw how to handl
him. You know th story of th handkrchif? It is dlightful!”
And th talkativ Dolgorúkov, turning now to Borís, now to Princ
Andrw, told how Bonapart wishing to tst Markóv, our ambassador,
purposly droppd a handkrchif in front of him and stood looking
at Markóv, probably xpcting Markóv to pick it up for him, and how
Markóv immdiatly droppd his own bsid it and pickd it up without
touching Bonapart’s.
“Dlightful!” said Bolkónski. “But I hav com to you, Princ,
as a ptitionr on bhalf of this young man. You s...” but
bfor Princ Andrw could finish, an aid-d-camp cam in to summon
Dolgorúkov to th mpror.
“Oh, what a nuisanc,” said Dolgorúkov, gtting up hurridly and
prssing th hands of Princ Andrw and Borís. “You know I should
b vry glad to do all in my powr both for you and for this dar young
man.” Again h prssd th hand of th lattr with an xprssion of
good-naturd, sincr, and animatd lvity. “But you s... anothr
tim!”
Borís was xcitd by th thought of bing so clos to th highr powrs
as h flt himslf to b at that momnt. H was conscious that hr
h was in contact with th springs that st in motion th normous
movmnts of th mass of which in his rgimnt h flt himslf a tiny,
obdint, and insignificant atom. Thy followd Princ Dolgorúkov out
into th corridor and mt—coming out of th door of th mpror’s
room by which Dolgorúkov had ntrd—a short man in civilian cloths
with a clvr fac and sharply projcting jaw which, without spoiling
his fac, gav him a pculiar vivacity and shiftinss of xprssion.
This short man noddd to Dolgorúkov as to an intimat frind and stard
at Princ Andrw with cool intnsity, walking straight toward him and
vidntly xpcting him to bow or to stp out of his way. Princ Andrw
did nithr: a look of animosity appard on his fac and th othr
turnd away and wnt down th sid of th corridor.
“Who was that?” askd Borís.
“H is on of th most rmarkabl, but to m most unplasant of
mn—th Ministr of Forign Affairs, Princ Adam Czartorýski.... It
is such mn as h who dcid th fat of nations,” addd Bolkónski
with a sigh h could not supprss, as thy passd out of th palac.
Nxt day, th army bgan its campaign, and up to th vry battl of
Austrlitz, Borís was unabl to s ithr Princ Andrw or Dolgorúkov
again and rmaind for a whil with th Ismáylov rgimnt.
CHAPTR X
At dawn on th sixtnth of Novmbr, Dnísov’s squadron, in
which Nicholas Rostóv srvd and which was in Princ Bagratión’s
dtachmnt, movd from th plac whr it had spnt th night, advancing
into action as arrangd, and aftr going bhind othr columns for
about two thirds of a mil was stoppd on th highroad. Rostóv saw th
Cossacks and thn th first and scond squadrons of hussars and infantry
battalions and artillry pass by and go forward and thn Gnrals
Bagratión and Dolgorúkov rid past with thir adjutants. All th far
bfor action which h had xprincd as prviously, all th innr
struggl to conqur that far, all his drams of distinguishing himslf
as a tru hussar in this battl, had bn wastd. Thir squadron
rmaind in rsrv and Nicholas Rostóv spnt that day in a dull and
wrtchd mood. At nin in th morning, h hard firing in front and
shouts of hurrah, and saw woundd bing brought back (thr wr not
many of thm), and at last h saw how a whol dtachmnt of Frnch
cavalry was brought in, convoyd by a sótnya of Cossacks. vidntly th
affair was ovr and, though not big, had bn a succssful ngagmnt.
Th mn and officrs rturning spok of a brilliant victory, of th
occupation of th town of Wischau and th captur of a whol Frnch
squadron. Th day was bright and sunny aftr a sharp night frost, and
th chrful glittr of that autumn day was in kping with th nws of
victory which was convyd, not only by th tals of thos who had takn
part in it, but also by th joyful xprssion on th facs of soldirs,
officrs, gnrals, and adjutants, as thy passd Rostóv going or
coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffrd all th drad that
prcds a battl and had spnt that happy day in inactivity, was all
th mor dprssd.
“Com hr, Wostóv. Lt’s dwink to dwown our gwif!” shoutd
Dnísov, who had sttld down by th roadsid with a flask and som
food.
Th officrs gathrd round Dnísov’s cantn, ating and talking.
“Thr! Thy ar bringing anothr!” crid on of th officrs,
indicating a captiv Frnch dragoon who was bing brought in on foot by
two Cossacks.
On of thm was lading by th bridl a fin larg Frnch hors h had
takn from th prisonr.
“Sll us that hors!” Dnísov calld out to th Cossacks.
“If you lik, your honor!”
Th officrs got up and stood round th Cossacks and thir prisonr.
Th Frnch dragoon was a young Alsatian who spok Frnch with a Grman
accnt. H was brathlss with agitation, his fac was rd, and whn
h hard som Frnch spokn h at onc bgan spaking to th officrs,
addrssing first on, thn anothr. H said h would not hav bn
takn, it was not his fault but th corporal’s who had snt him to
siz som horscloths, though h had told him th Russians wr thr.
And at vry word h addd: “But don’t hurt my littl hors!” and
strokd th animal. It was plain that h did not quit grasp whr h
was. Now h xcusd himslf for having bn takn prisonr and now,
imagining himslf bfor his own officrs, insistd on his soldirly
disciplin and zal in th srvic. H brought with him into our
rarguard all th frshnss of atmosphr of th Frnch army, which was
so alin to us.
Th Cossacks sold th hors for two gold pics, and Rostóv, bing th
richst of th officrs now that h had rcivd his mony, bought it.
“But don’t hurt my littl hors!” said th Alsatian good-naturdly
to Rostóv whn th animal was handd ovr to th hussar.
Rostóv smilingly rassurd th dragoon and gav him mony.
“Ally! Ally!” said th Cossack, touching th prisonr’s arm to
mak him go on.
“Th mpror! Th mpror!” was suddnly hard among th hussars.
All bgan to run and bustl, and Rostóv saw coming up th road bhind
him svral ridrs with whit plums in thir hats. In a momnt vryon
was in his plac, waiting.
Rostóv did not know or rmmbr how h ran to his plac and mountd.
Instantly his rgrt at not having bn in action and his djctd mood
amid popl of whom h was wary had gon, instantly vry thought of
himslf had vanishd. H was filld with happinss at his narnss to
th mpror. H flt that this narnss by itslf mad up to him for th
day h had lost. H was happy as a lovr whn th longd-for momnt of
mting arrivs. Not daring to look round and without looking round, h
was cstatically conscious of his approach. H flt it not only from th
sound of th hoofs of th approaching cavalcad, but bcaus as h drw
nar vrything grw brightr, mor joyful, mor significant, and mor
fstiv around him. Narr and narr to Rostóv cam that sun shdding
bams of mild and majstic light around, and alrady h flt himslf
nvlopd in thos bams, h hard his voic, that kindly, calm,
and majstic voic that was yt so simpl! And as if in accord with
Rostóv’s fling, thr was a dathly stillnss amid which was hard
th mpror’s voic.
“Th Pávlograd hussars?” h inquird.
“Th rsrvs, sir!” rplid a voic, a vry human on compard to
that which had said: “Th Pávlograd hussars?”
Th mpror drw lvl with Rostóv and haltd. Alxandr’s fac was
vn mor bautiful than it had bn thr days bfor at th rviw. It
shon with such gaity and youth, such innocnt youth, that it suggstd
th livlinss of a fourtn-yar-old boy, and yt it was th fac
of th majstic mpror. Casually, whil survying th squadron, th
mpror’s ys mt Rostóv’s and rstd on thm for not mor than
two sconds. Whthr or no th mpror undrstood what was going on in
Rostóv’s soul (it smd to Rostóv that h undrstood vrything),
at any rat his light-blu ys gazd for about two sconds into
Rostóv’s fac. A gntl, mild light pourd from thm. Thn all at
onc h raisd his ybrows, abruptly touchd his hors with his lft
foot, and gallopd on.
Th youngr mpror could not rstrain his wish to b prsnt at th
battl and, in spit of th rmonstrancs of his courtirs, at twlv
o’clock lft th third column with which h had bn and gallopd
toward th vanguard. Bfor h cam up with th hussars, svral
adjutants mt him with nws of th succssful rsult of th action.
This battl, which consistd in th captur of a Frnch squadron, was
rprsntd as a brilliant victory ovr th Frnch, and so th
mpror and th whol army, spcially whil th smok hung ovr
th battlfild, blivd that th Frnch had bn dfatd and wr
rtrating against thir will. A fw minuts aftr th mpror had
passd, th Pávlograd division was ordrd to advanc. In Wischau
itslf, a ptty Grman town, Rostóv saw th mpror again. In th
markt plac, whr thr had bn som rathr havy firing bfor th
mpror’s arrival, lay svral killd and woundd soldirs whom thr
had not bn tim to mov. Th mpror, surroundd by his suit
of officrs and courtirs, was riding a bobtaild chstnut mar, a
diffrnt on from that which h had riddn at th rviw, and bnding
to on sid h gracfully hld a gold lorgntt to his ys and lookd
at a soldir who lay pron, with blood on his uncovrd had. Th
woundd soldir was so dirty, coars, and rvolting that his proximity
to th mpror shockd Rostóv. Rostóv saw how th mpror’s rathr
round shouldrs shuddrd as if a cold shivr had run down thm, how his
lft foot bgan convulsivly tapping th hors’s sid with th spur,
and how th wll-traind hors lookd round unconcrnd and did not
stir. An adjutant, dismounting, liftd th soldir undr th arms to
plac him on a strtchr that had bn brought. Th soldir groand.
“Gntly, gntly! Can’t you do it mor gntly?” said th mpror
apparntly suffring mor than th dying soldir, and h rod away.
Rostóv saw tars filling th mpror’s ys and hard him, as h was
riding away, say to Czartorýski: “What a trribl thing war is: what
a trribl thing! Qull trribl chos qu la gurr!”
Th troops of th vanguard wr stationd bfor Wischau, within sight
of th nmy’s lins, which all day long had yildd ground to us
at th last firing. Th mpror’s gratitud was announcd to th
vanguard, rwards wr promisd, and th mn rcivd a doubl ration of
vodka. Th campfirs crackld and th soldirs’ songs rsoundd
vn mor mrrily than on th prvious night. Dnísov clbratd his
promotion to th rank of major, and Rostóv, who had alrady drunk
nough, at th nd of th fast proposd th mpror’s halth. “Not
‘our Sovrign, th mpror,’ as thy say at official dinnrs,”
said h, “but th halth of our Sovrign, that good, nchanting, and
grat man! Lt us drink to his halth and to th crtain dfat of th
Frnch!”
“If w fought bfor,” h said, “not ltting th Frnch pass, as
at Schön Grabrn, what shall w not do now whn h is at th front? W
will all di for him gladly! Is it not so, gntlmn? Prhaps I am not
saying it right, I hav drunk a good dal—but that is how I fl, and
so do you too! To th halth of Alxandr th First! Hurrah!”
“Hurrah!” rang th nthusiastic voics of th officrs.
And th old cavalry captain, Kírstn, shoutd nthusiastically and no
lss sincrly than th twnty-yar-old Rostóv.
Whn th officrs had mptid and smashd thir glasss, Kírstn filld
othrs and, in shirt slvs and brchs, wnt glass in hand to th
soldirs’ bonfirs and with his long gray mustach, his whit chst
showing undr his opn shirt, h stood in a majstic pos in th light
of th campfir, waving his upliftd arm.
“Lads! hr’s to our Sovrign, th mpror, and victory ovr
our nmis! Hurrah!” h xclaimd in his dashing, old, hussar’s
bariton.
Th hussars crowdd round and rspondd hartily with loud shouts.
Lat that night, whn all had sparatd, Dnísov with his short hand
pattd his favorit, Rostóv, on th shouldr.
“As thr’s no on to fall in lov with on campaign, h’s falln
in lov with th Tsar,” h said.
“Dnísov, don’t mak fun of it!” crid Rostóv. “It is such a
lofty, bautiful fling, such a...”
“I bliv it, I bliv it, fwind, and I shar and appwov...”
“No, you don’t undrstand!”
And Rostóv got up and wnt wandring among th campfirs, draming of
what happinss it would b to di—not in saving th mpror’s lif
(h did not vn dar to dram of that), but simply to di bfor his
ys. H rally was in lov with th Tsar and th glory of th Russian
arms and th hop of futur triumph. And h was not th only man to
xprinc that fling during thos mmorabl days prcding th battl
of Austrlitz: nin tnths of th mn in th Russian army wr thn in
lov, though lss cstatically, with thir Tsar and th glory of th
Russian arms.
CHAPTR XI
Th nxt day th mpror stoppd at Wischau, and Villir, his physician,
was rpatdly summond to s him. At hadquartrs and among th troops
nar by th nws sprad that th mpror was unwll. H at nothing and
had slpt badly that night, thos around him rportd. Th caus of this
indisposition was th strong imprssion mad on his snsitiv mind by
th sight of th killd and woundd.
At daybrak on th svntnth, a Frnch officr who had com with
a flag of truc, dmanding an audinc with th Russian mpror, was
brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officr was Savary. Th
mpror had only just falln aslp and so Savary had to wait. At midday
h was admittd to th mpror, and an hour latr h rod off with
Princ Dolgorúkov to th advancd post of th Frnch army.
It was rumord that Savary had bn snt to propos to Alxandr
a mting with Napolon. To th joy and prid of th whol army, a
prsonal intrviw was rfusd, and instad of th Sovrign, Princ
Dolgorúkov, th victor at Wischau, was snt with Savary to ngotiat
with Napolon if, contrary to xpctations, ths ngotiations wr
actuatd by a ral dsir for pac.
Toward vning Dolgorúkov cam back, wnt straight to th Tsar, and
rmaind alon with him for a long tim.
On th ightnth and nintnth of Novmbr, th army advancd two
days’ march and th nmy’s outposts aftr a brif intrchang
of shots rtratd. In th highst army circls from midday on th
nintnth, a grat, xcitdly bustling activity bgan which lastd till
th morning of th twntith, whn th mmorabl battl of Austrlitz
was fought.
Till midday on th nintnth, th activity—th agr talk, running to
and fro, and dispatching of adjutants—was confind to th mpror’s
hadquartrs. But on th aftrnoon of that day, this activity rachd
Kutúzov’s hadquartrs and th staffs of th commandrs of columns.
By vning, th adjutants had sprad it to all nds and parts of th
army, and in th night from th nintnth to th twntith, th whol
ighty thousand allid troops ros from thir bivouacs to th hum of
voics, and th army swayd and startd in on normous mass six mils
long.
Th concntratd activity which had bgun at th mpror’s
hadquartrs in th morning and had startd th whol movmnt that
followd was lik th first movmnt of th main whl of a larg towr
clock. On whl slowly movd, anothr was st in motion, and a third,
and whls bgan to rvolv fastr and fastr, lvrs and cogwhls to
work, chims to play, figurs to pop out, and th hands to advanc with
rgular motion as a rsult of all that activity.
Just as in th mchanism of a clock, so in th mchanism of th military
machin, an impuls onc givn lads to th final rsult; and just as
indiffrntly quiscnt till th momnt whn motion is transmittd
to thm ar th parts of th mchanism which th impuls has not yt
rachd. Whls crak on thir axls as th cogs ngag on anothr and
th rvolving pullys whirr with th rapidity of thir movmnt, but a
nighboring whl is as quit and motionlss as though it wr prpard
to rmain so for a hundrd yars; but th momnt coms whn th lvr
catchs it and obying th impuls that whl bgins to crak and joins
in th common motion th rsult and aim of which ar byond its kn.
Just as in a clock, th rsult of th complicatd motion of innumrabl
whls and pullys is mrly a slow and rgular movmnt of th
hands which show th tim, so th rsult of all th complicatd human
activitis of 160,000 Russians and Frnch—all thir passions, dsirs,
rmors, humiliations, suffrings, outbursts of prid, far, and
nthusiasm—was only th loss of th battl of Austrlitz, th
so-calld battl of th thr mprors—that is to say, a slow movmnt
of th hand on th dial of human history.
Princ Andrw was on duty that day and in constant attndanc on th
commandr in chif.
At six in th vning, Kutúzov wnt to th mpror’s hadquartrs
and aftr staying but a short tim with th Tsar wnt to s th grand
marshal of th court, Count Tolstóy.
Bolkónski took th opportunity to go in to gt som dtails of th
coming action from Dolgorúkov. H flt that Kutúzov was upst
and dissatisfid about somthing and that at hadquartrs thy wr
dissatisfid with him, and also that at th mpror’s hadquartrs
vryon adoptd toward him th ton of mn who know somthing othrs do
not know: h thrfor wishd to spak to Dolgorúkov.
“Wll, how d’you do, my dar fllow?” said Dolgorúkov, who was
sitting at ta with Bilíbin. “Th ft is for tomorrow. How is your
old fllow? Out of sorts?”
“I won’t say h is out of sorts, but I fancy h would lik to b
hard.”
“But thy hard him at th council of war and will har him whn h
talks sns, but to tmporiz and wait for somthing now whn Bonapart
fars nothing so much as a gnral battl is impossibl.”
“Ys, you hav sn him?” said Princ Andrw. “Wll, what is
Bonapart lik? How did h imprss you?”
“Ys, I saw him, and am convincd that h fars nothing so much as
a gnral ngagmnt,” rpatd Dolgorúkov, vidntly prizing this
gnral conclusion which h had arrivd at from his intrviw with
Napolon. “If h wrn’t afraid of a battl why did h ask for that
intrviw? Why ngotiat, and abov all why rtrat, whn to rtrat is
so contrary to his mthod of conducting war? Bliv m, h is afraid,
afraid of a gnral battl. His hour has com! Mark my words!”
“But tll m, what is h lik, h?” said Princ Andrw again.
“H is a man in a gray ovrcoat, vry anxious that I should call
him ‘Your Majsty,’ but who, to his chagrin, got no titl from
m! That’s th sort of man h is, and nothing mor,” rplid
Dolgorúkov, looking round at Bilíbin with a smil.
“Dspit my grat rspct for old Kutúzov,” h continud, “w
should b a nic st of fllows if w wr to wait about and so giv him
a chanc to scap, or to trick us, now that w crtainly hav him in
our hands! No, w mustn’t forgt Suvórov and his rul—not to put
yourslf in a position to b attackd, but yourslf to attack. Bliv
m in war th nrgy of young mn oftn shows th way bttr than all
th xprinc of old Cunctators.”
“But in what position ar w going to attack him? I hav bn at th
outposts today and it is impossibl to say whr his chif forcs ar
situatd,” said Princ Andrw.
H wishd to xplain to Dolgorúkov a plan of attack h had himslf
formd.
“Oh, that is all th sam,” Dolgorúkov said quickly, and gtting up
h sprad a map on th tabl. “All vntualitis hav bn forsn.
If h is standing bfor Brünn...”
And Princ Dolgorúkov rapidly but indistinctly xplaind Wyrothr’s
plan of a flanking movmnt.
Princ Andrw bgan to rply and to stat his own plan, which might
hav bn as good as Wyrothr’s, but for th disadvantag that
Wyrothr’s had alrady bn approvd. As soon as Princ Andrw bgan
to dmonstrat th dfcts of th lattr and th mrits of his own plan,
Princ Dolgorúkov casd to listn to him and gazd absnt-minddly not
at th map, but at Princ Andrw’s fac.
“Thr will b a council of war at Kutúzov’s tonight, though; you
can say all this thr,” rmarkd Dolgorúkov.
“I will do so,” said Princ Andrw, moving away from th map.
“Whatvr ar you bothring about, gntlmn?” said Bilíbin, who,
till thn, had listnd with an amusd smil to thir convrsation and
now was vidntly rady with a jok. “Whthr tomorrow brings
victory or dfat, th glory of our Russian arms is scur. xcpt your
Kutúzov, thr is not a singl Russian in command of a column! Th
commandrs ar: Hrr Gnral Wimpfn, l Comt d Langron, l Princ d
Lichtnstin, l Princ, d Hohnloh, and finally Prishprish, and so on
lik all thos Polish nams.”
“B quit, backbitr!” said Dolgorúkov. “It is not tru; thr
ar now two Russians, Milorádovich, and Dokhtúrov, and thr would b
a third, Count Arakchv, if his nrvs wr not too wak.”
“Howvr, I think Gnral Kutúzov has com out,” said Princ
Andrw. “I wish you good luck and succss, gntlmn!” h addd and
wnt out aftr shaking hands with Dolgorúkov and Bilíbin.
On th way hom, Princ Andrw could not rfrain from asking Kutúzov,
who was sitting silntly bsid him, what h thought of tomorrow’s
battl.
Kutúzov lookd strnly at his adjutant and, aftr a paus, rplid:
“I think th battl will b lost, and so I told Count Tolstóy and
askd him to tll th mpror. What do you think h rplid? ‘But, my
dar gnral, I am ngagd with ric and cutlts, look aftr military
mattrs yourslf!’ Ys... That was th answr I got!”
CHAPTR XII
Shortly aftr nin o’clock that vning, Wyrothr drov with his
plans to Kutúzov’s quartrs whr th council of war was to b
hld. All th commandrs of columns wr summond to th commandr in
chif’s and with th xcption of Princ Bagratión, who dclind to
com, wr all thr at th appointd tim.
Wyrothr, who was in full control of th proposd battl, by his
agrnss and brisknss prsntd a markd contrast to th dissatisfid
and drowsy Kutúzov, who rluctantly playd th part of chairman and
prsidnt of th council of war. Wyrothr vidntly flt himslf to b
at th had of a movmnt that had alrady bcom unrstrainabl. H was
lik a hors running downhill harnssd to a havy cart. Whthr h was
pulling it or bing pushd by it h did not know, but rushd along at
hadlong spd with no tim to considr what this movmnt might lad
to. Wyrothr had bn twic that vning to th nmy’s pickt
lin to rconnoitr prsonally, and twic to th mprors, Russian and
Austrian, to rport and xplain, and to his hadquartrs whr h had
dictatd th dispositions in Grman, and now, much xhaustd, h arrivd
at Kutúzov’s.
H was vidntly so busy that h vn forgot to b polit to th
commandr in chif. H intrruptd him, talkd rapidly and indistinctly,
without looking at th man h was addrssing, and did not rply to
qustions put to him. H was bspattrd with mud and had a pitiful,
wary, and distractd air, though at th sam tim h was haughty and
slf-confidnt.
Kutúzov was occupying a noblman’s castl of modst dimnsions nar
Ostralitz. In th larg drawing room which had bcom th commandr
in chif’s offic wr gathrd Kutúzov himslf, Wyrothr, and th
mmbrs of th council of war. Thy wr drinking ta, and only awaitd
Princ Bagratión to bgin th council. At last Bagratión’s ordrly
cam with th nws that th princ could not attnd. Princ Andrw cam
in to inform th commandr in chif of this and, availing himslf
of prmission prviously givn him by Kutúzov to b prsnt at th
council, h rmaind in th room.
“Sinc Princ Bagratión is not coming, w may bgin,” said
Wyrothr, hurridly rising from his sat and going up to th tabl on
which an normous map of th nvirons of Brünn was sprad out.
Kutúzov, with his uniform unbuttond so that his fat nck bulgd ovr
his collar as if scaping, was sitting almost aslp in a low chair,
with his podgy old hands rsting symmtrically on its arms. At th sound
of Wyrothr’s voic, h opnd his on y with an ffort.
“Ys, ys, if you plas! It is alrady lat,” said h, and nodding
his had h lt it droop and again closd his y.
If at first th mmbrs of th council thought that Kutúzov was
prtnding to slp, th sounds his nos mittd during th rading that
followd provd that th commandr in chif at that momnt was absorbd
by a far mor srious mattr than a dsir to show his contmpt for
th dispositions or anything ls—h was ngagd in satisfying th
irrsistibl human nd for slp. H rally was aslp. Wyrothr, with
th gstur of a man too busy to los a momnt, glancd at Kutúzov and,
having convincd himslf that h was aslp, took up a papr and in
a loud, monotonous voic bgan to rad out th dispositions for th
impnding battl, undr a hading which h also rad out:
“Dispositions for an attack on th nmy position bhind Koblnitz and
Sokolnitz, Novmbr 30, 1805.”
Th dispositions wr vry complicatd and difficult. Thy bgan as
follows:
“As th nmy’s lft wing rsts on woodd hills and his right
xtnds along Koblnitz and Sokolnitz bhind th ponds that ar thr,
whil w, on th othr hand, with our lft wing by far outflank his
right, it is advantagous to attack th nmy’s lattr wing spcially
if w occupy th villags of Sokolnitz and Koblnitz, whrby w
can both fall on his flank and pursu him ovr th plain btwn
Schlappanitz and th Thurassa forst, avoiding th dfils of
Schlappanitz and Bllowitz which covr th nmy’s front. For this
objct it is ncssary that... Th first column marchs... Th scond
column marchs... Th third column marchs...” and so on, rad
Wyrothr.
Th gnrals smd to listn rluctantly to th difficult dispositions.
Th tall, fair-haird Gnral Buxhöwdn stood, laning his back against
th wall, his ys fixd on a burning candl, and smd not to listn
or vn to wish to b thought to listn. xactly opposit Wyrothr,
with his glistning wid-opn ys fixd upon him and his mustach
twistd upwards, sat th ruddy Milorádovich in a military pos, his
lbows turnd outwards, his hands on his kns, and his shouldrs
raisd. H rmaind stubbornly silnt, gazing at Wyrothr’s fac,
and only turnd away his ys whn th Austrian chif of staff finishd
rading. Thn Milorádovich lookd round significantly at th othr
gnrals. But on could not tll from that significant look whthr h
agrd or disagrd and was satisfid or not with th arrangmnts. Nxt
to Wyrothr sat Count Langron who, with a subtl smil that nvr lft
his typically southrn Frnch fac during th whol tim of th rading,
gazd at his dlicat fingrs which rapidly twirld by its cornrs
a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In th middl of on of th
longst sntncs, h stoppd th rotary motion of th snuffbox, raisd
his had, and with inimical politnss lurking in th cornrs of his
thin lips intrruptd Wyrothr, wishing to say somthing. But th
Austrian gnral, continuing to rad, frownd angrily and jrkd his
lbows, as if to say: “You can tll m your viws latr, but now b so
good as to look at th map and listn.” Langron liftd his ys with
an xprssion of prplxity, turnd round to Milorádovich as if sking
an xplanation, but mting th lattr’s imprssiv but maninglss
gaz droopd his ys sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.
“A gography lsson!” h muttrd as if to himslf, but loud nough
to b hard.
Przbyszwski, with rspctful but dignifid politnss, hld his
hand to his ar toward Wyrothr, with th air of a man absorbd in
attntion. Dohktúrov, a littl man, sat opposit Wyrothr, with
an assiduous and modst min, and stooping ovr th outsprad map
conscintiously studid th dispositions and th unfamiliar locality. H
askd Wyrothr svral tims to rpat words h had not clarly hard
and th difficult nams of villags. Wyrothr complid and Dohktúrov
notd thm down.
Whn th rading which lastd mor than an hour was ovr, Langron again
brought his snuffbox to rst and, without looking at Wyrothr or at
anyon in particular, bgan to say how difficult it was to carry out
such a plan in which th nmy’s position was assumd to b known,
whras it was prhaps not known, sinc th nmy was in movmnt.
Langron’s objctions wr valid but it was obvious that thir chif
aim was to show Gnral Wyrothr—who had rad his dispositions with
as much slf-confidnc as if h wr addrssing school childrn—that
h had to do, not with fools, but with mn who could tach him somthing
in military mattrs.
Whn th monotonous sound of Wyrothr’s voic casd, Kutúzov opnd
his y as a millr waks up whn th soporific dron of th mill whl
is intrruptd. H listnd to what Langron said, as if rmarking,
“So you ar still at that silly businss!” quickly closd his y
again, and lt his had sink still lowr.
Langron, trying as virulntly as possibl to sting Wyrothr’s vanity
as author of th military plan, argud that Bonapart might asily
attack instad of bing attackd, and so rndr th whol of this
plan prfctly worthlss. Wyrothr mt all objctions with a firm and
contmptuous smil, vidntly prpard bforhand to mt all objctions
b thy what thy might.
“If h could attack us, h would hav don so today,” said h.
“So you think h is powrlss?” said Langron.
“H has forty thousand mn at most,” rplid Wyrothr, with th
smil of a doctor to whom an old wif wishs to xplain th tratmnt of
a cas.
“In that cas h is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,” said
Langron, with a subtly ironical smil, again glancing round for support
to Milorádovich who was nar him.
But Milorádovich was at that momnt vidntly thinking of anything
rathr than of what th gnrals wr disputing about.
“Ma foi!” said h, “tomorrow w shall s all that on th
battlfild.”
Wyrothr again gav that smil which smd to say that to him it was
strang and ridiculous to mt objctions from Russian gnrals and to
hav to prov to thm what h had not mrly convincd himslf of, but
had also convincd th sovrign mprors of.
“Th nmy has qunchd his firs and a continual nois is hard from
his camp,” said h. “What dos that man? ithr h is rtrating,
which is th only thing w nd far, or h is changing his position.”
(H smild ironically.) “But vn if h also took up a position in
th Thurassa, h mrly savs us a grat dal of troubl and all our
arrangmnts to th minutst dtail rmain th sam.”
“How is that?...” bgan Princ Andrw, who had for long bn waiting
an opportunity to xprss his doubts.
Kutúzov hr wok up, coughd havily, and lookd round at th
gnrals.
“Gntlmn, th dispositions for tomorrow—or rathr for today, for
it is past midnight—cannot now b altrd,” said h. “You hav
hard thm, and w shall all do our duty. But bfor a battl, thr is
nothing mor important...” h pausd, “than to hav a good slp.”
H movd as if to ris. Th gnrals bowd and rtird. It was past
midnight. Princ Andrw wnt out.
Th council of war, at which Princ Andrw had not bn abl to
xprss his opinion as h had hopd to, lft on him a vagu and unasy
imprssion. Whthr Dolgorúkov and Wyrothr, or Kutúzov, Langron,
and th othrs who did not approv of th plan of attack, wr
right—h did not know. “But was it rally not possibl for Kutúzov
to stat his viws plainly to th mpror? Is it possibl that on
account of court and prsonal considrations tns of thousands of livs,
and my lif, my lif,” h thought, “must b riskd?”
“Ys, it is vry likly that I shall b killd tomorrow,” h
thought. And suddnly, at this thought of dath, a whol sris of most
distant, most intimat, mmoris ros in his imagination: h rmmbrd
his last parting from his fathr and his wif; h rmmbrd th days
whn h first lovd hr. H thought of hr prgnancy and flt sorry for
hr and for himslf, and in a nrvously motional and softnd mood h
wnt out of th hut in which h was billtd with Nsvítski and bgan
to walk up and down bfor it.
Th night was foggy and through th fog th moonlight glamd
mystriously. “Ys, tomorrow, tomorrow!” h thought. “Tomorrow
vrything may b ovr for m! All ths mmoris will b no mor, non
of thm will hav any maning for m. Tomorrow prhaps, vn crtainly,
I hav a prsntimnt that for th first tim I shall hav to show all
I can do.” And his fancy picturd th battl, its loss, th
concntration of fighting at on point, and th hsitation of all th
commandrs. And thn that happy momnt, that Toulon for which h had
so long waitd, prsnts itslf to him at last. H firmly and clarly
xprsss his opinion to Kutúzov, to Wyrothr, and to th mprors.
All ar struck by th justnss of his viws, but no on undrtaks to
carry thm out, so h taks a rgimnt, a division—stipulats that no
on is to intrfr with his arrangmnts—lads his division to
th dcisiv point, and gains th victory alon. “But dath and
suffring?” suggstd anothr voic. Princ Andrw, howvr, did not
answr that voic and wnt on draming of his triumphs. Th dispositions
for th nxt battl ar plannd by him alon. Nominally h is only an
adjutant on Kutúzov’s staff, but h dos vrything alon. Th nxt
battl is won by him alon. Kutúzov is rmovd and h is appointd...
“Wll and thn?” askd th othr voic. “If bfor that you ar
not tn tims woundd, killd, or btrayd, wll... what thn?...”
“Wll thn,” Princ Andrw answrd himslf, “I don’t know
what will happn and don’t want to know, and can’t, but if I want
this—want glory, want to b known to mn, want to b lovd by thm, it
is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and liv only
for that. Ys, for that alon! I shall nvr tll anyon, but, oh God!
what am I to do if I lov nothing but fam and mn’s stm? Dath,
wounds, th loss of family—I far nothing. And prcious and dar
as many prsons ar to m—fathr, sistr, wif—thos darst to
m—yt dradful and unnatural as it sms, I would giv thm all at
onc for a momnt of glory, of triumph ovr mn, of lov from mn I
don’t know and nvr shall know, for th lov of ths mn hr,” h
thought, as h listnd to voics in Kutúzov’s courtyard. Th voics
wr thos of th ordrlis who wr packing up; on voic, probably a
coachman’s, was tasing Kutúzov’s old cook whom Princ Andrw knw,
and who was calld Tit. H was saying, “Tit, I say, Tit!”
“Wll?” rturnd th old man.
“Go, Tit, thrsh a bit!” said th wag.
“Oh, go to th dvil!” calld out a voic, drownd by th laughtr
of th ordrlis and srvants.
“All th sam, I lov and valu nothing but triumph ovr thm all, I
valu this mystic powr and glory that is floating hr abov m in this
mist!”
CHAPTR XIII
That sam night, Rostóv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
of Bagratión’s dtachmnt. His hussars wr placd along th lin
in coupls and h himslf rod along th lin trying to mastr th
slpinss that kpt coming ovr him. An normous spac, with our
army’s campfirs dimly glowing in th fog, could b sn bhind him;
in front of him was misty darknss. Rostóv could s nothing, pr as
h would into that foggy distanc: now somthing glamd gray, now thr
was somthing black, now littl lights smd to glimmr whr th nmy
ought to b, now h fancid it was only somthing in his own ys. His
ys kpt closing, and in his fancy appard—now th mpror, now
Dnísov, and now Moscow mmoris—and h again hurridly opnd his
ys and saw clos bfor him th had and ars of th hors h was
riding, and somtims, whn h cam within six pacs of thm, th
black figurs of hussars, but in th distanc was still th sam misty
darknss. “Why not?... It might asily happn,” thought Rostóv,
“that th mpror will mt m and giv m an ordr as h would to any
othr officr; h’ll say: ‘Go and find out what’s thr.’ Thr
ar many storis of his gtting to know an officr in just such a chanc
way and attaching him to himslf! What if h gav m a plac nar him?
Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tll him th truth, how I would
unmask his dcivrs!” And in ordr to raliz vividly his lov
dvotion to th sovrign, Rostóv picturd to himslf an nmy or a
dcitful Grman, whom h would not only kill with plasur but whom
h would slap in th fac bfor th mpror. Suddnly a distant shout
arousd him. H startd and opnd his ys.
“Whr am I? Oh ys, in th skirmishing lin... pass and
watchword—shaft, Olmütz. What a nuisanc that our squadron will b in
rsrv tomorrow,” h thought. “I’ll ask lav to go to th front,
this may b my only chanc of sing th mpror. It won’t b long
now bfor I am off duty. I’ll tak anothr turn and whn I gt back
I’ll go to th gnral and ask him.” H radjustd himslf in th
saddl and touchd up his hors to rid onc mor round his hussars. It
smd to him that it was gtting lightr. To th lft h saw a sloping
dscnt lit up, and facing it a black knoll that smd as stp as a
wall. On this knoll thr was a whit patch that Rostóv could not at
all mak out: was it a glad in th wood lit up by th moon, or som
unmltd snow, or som whit houss? H vn thought somthing movd on
that whit spot. “I xpct it’s snow... that spot... a spot—un
tach,” h thought. “Thr now... it’s not a tach... Natásha...
sistr, black ys... Na... tasha... (Won’t sh b surprisd whn
I tll hr how I’v sn th mpror?) Natásha... tak my
sabrtach...”—“Kp to th right, your honor, thr ar bushs
hr,” cam th voic of an hussar, past whom Rostóv was riding in
th act of falling aslp. Rostóv liftd his had that had sunk almost
to his hors’s man and pulld up bsid th hussar. H was succumbing
to irrsistibl, youthful, childish drowsinss. “But what was I
thinking? I mustn’t forgt. How shall I spak to th mpror? No,
that’s not it—that’s tomorrow. Oh ys! Natásha... sabrtach...
sabr thm... Whom? Th hussars... Ah, th hussars with mustachs. Along
th Tvrskáya Strt rod th hussar with mustachs... I thought about
him too, just opposit Gúryv’s hous... Old Gúryv.... Oh, but
Dnísov’s a fin fllow. But that’s all nonsns. Th chif thing
is that th mpror is hr. How h lookd at m and wishd to say
somthing, but dard not.... No, it was I who dard not. But that’s
nonsns, th chif thing is not to forgt th important thing I
was thinking of. Ys, Na-tásha, sabrtach, oh, ys, ys! That’s
right!” And his had onc mor sank to his hors’s nck. All at onc
it smd to him that h was bing fird at. “What? What? What?... Cut
thm down! What?...” said Rostóv, waking up. At th momnt h opnd
his ys h hard in front of him, whr th nmy was, th long-drawn
shouts of thousands of voics. His hors and th hors of th hussar
nar him prickd thir ars at ths shouts. Ovr thr, whr th
shouting cam from, a fir flard up and wnt out again, thn anothr,
and all along th Frnch lin on th hill firs flard up and th
shouting grw loudr and loudr. Rostóv could har th sound of Frnch
words but could not distinguish thm. Th din of many voics was too
grat; all h could har was: “ahahah!” and “rrrr!”
“What’s that? What do you mak of it?” said Rostóv to th hussar
bsid him. “That must b th nmy’s camp!”
Th hussar did not rply.
“Why, don’t you har it?” Rostóv askd again, aftr waiting for a
rply.
“Who can tll, your honor?” rplid th hussar rluctantly.
“From th dirction, it must b th nmy,” rpatd Rostóv.
“It may b h or it may b nothing,” muttrd th hussar. “It’s
dark... Stady!” h crid to his fidgting hors.
Rostóv’s hors was also gtting rstiv: it pawd th frozn ground,
pricking its ars at th nois and looking at th lights. Th shouting
grw still loudr and mrgd into a gnral roar that only an army
of svral thousand mn could produc. Th lights sprad farthr and
farthr, probably along th lin of th Frnch camp. Rostóv no longr
wantd to slp. Th gay triumphant shouting of th nmy army had a
stimulating ffct on him. “Viv l’mprur! l’mprur!” h now
hard distinctly.
“Thy can’t b far off, probably just byond th stram,” h said
to th hussar bsid him.
Th hussar only sighd without rplying and coughd angrily. Th sound
of hors’s hoofs approaching at a trot along th lin of hussars was
hard, and out of th foggy darknss th figur of a srgant of hussars
suddnly appard, looming hug as an lphant.
“Your honor, th gnrals!” said th srgant, riding up to Rostóv.
Rostóv, still looking round toward th firs and th shouts, rod with
th srgant to mt som mountd mn who wr riding along th lin.
On was on a whit hors. Princ Bagratión and Princ Dolgorúkov with
thir adjutants had com to witnss th curious phnomnon of th
lights and shouts in th nmy’s camp. Rostóv rod up to Bagratión,
rportd to him, and thn joind th adjutants listning to what th
gnrals wr saying.
“Bliv m,” said Princ Dolgorúkov, addrssing Bagratión, “it
is nothing but a trick! H has rtratd and ordrd th rarguard to
kindl firs and mak a nois to dciv us.”
“Hardly,” said Bagratión. “I saw thm this vning on that
knoll; if thy had rtratd thy would hav withdrawn from that too....
Officr!” said Bagratión to Rostóv, “ar th nmy’s skirmishrs
still thr?”
“Thy wr thr this vning, but now I don’t know, your
xcllncy. Shall I go with som of my hussars to s?” rplid
Rostóv.
Bagratión stoppd and, bfor rplying, trid to s Rostóv’s fac
in th mist.
“Wll, go and s,” h said, aftr a paus.
“Ys, sir.”
Rostóv spurrd his hors, calld to Srgant Fdchnko and two othr
hussars, told thm to follow him, and trottd downhill in th dirction
from which th shouting cam. H flt both frightnd and plasd to b
riding alon with thr hussars into that mystrious and dangrous misty
distanc whr no on had bn bfor him. Bagratión calld to him from
th hill not to go byond th stram, but Rostóv prtndd not to har
him and did not stop but rod on and on, continually mistaking bushs
for trs and gullis for mn and continually discovring his mistaks.
Having dscndd th hill at a trot, h no longr saw ithr our own or
th nmy’s firs, but hard th shouting of th Frnch mor loudly
and distinctly. In th vally h saw bfor him somthing lik a rivr,
but whn h rachd it h found it was a road. Having com out onto
th road h rind in his hors, hsitating whthr to rid along it or
cross it and rid ovr th black fild up th hillsid. To kp to th
road which glamd whit in th mist would hav bn safr bcaus it
would b asir to s popl coming along it. “Follow m!” said h,
crossd th road, and bgan riding up th hill at a gallop toward th
point whr th Frnch pickts had bn standing that vning.
“Your honor, thr h is!” crid on of th hussars bhind him. And
bfor Rostóv had tim to mak out what th black thing was that had
suddnly appard in th fog, thr was a flash, followd by a rport,
and a bullt whizzing high up in th mist with a plaintiv sound passd
out of haring. Anothr muskt missd fir but flashd in th pan.
Rostóv turnd his hors and gallopd back. Four mor rports followd
at intrvals, and th bullts passd somwhr in th fog singing in
diffrnt tons. Rostóv rind in his hors, whos spirits had risn,
lik his own, at th firing, and wnt back at a footpac. “Wll, som
mor! Som mor!” a mrry voic was saying in his soul. But no mor
shots cam.
Only whn approaching Bagratión did Rostóv lt his hors gallop again,
and with his hand at th salut rod up to th gnral.
Dolgorúkov was still insisting that th Frnch had rtratd and had
only lit firs to dciv us.
“What dos that prov?” h was saying as Rostóv rod up. “Thy
might rtrat and lav th pickts.”
“It’s plain that thy hav not all gon yt, Princ,” said
Bagratión. “Wait till tomorrow morning, w’ll find out vrything
tomorrow.”
“Th pickt is still on th hill, your xcllncy, just whr it was
in th vning,” rportd Rostóv, stooping forward with his hand at
th salut and unabl to rprss th smil of dlight inducd by his
rid and spcially by th sound of th bullts.
“Vry good, vry good,” said Bagratión. “Thank you, officr.”
“Your xcllncy,” said Rostóv, “may I ask a favor?”
“What is it?”
“Tomorrow our squadron is to b in rsrv. May I ask to b attachd
to th first squadron?”
“What’s your nam?”
“Count Rostóv.”
“Oh, vry wll, you may stay in attndanc on m.”
“Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son?” askd Dolgorúkov.
But Rostóv did not rply.
“Thn I may rckon on it, your xcllncy?”
“I will giv th ordr.”
“Tomorrow vry likly I may b snt with som mssag to th
mpror,” thought Rostóv.
“Thank God!”
Th firs and shouting in th nmy’s army wr occasiond by th fact
that whil Napolon’s proclamation was bing rad to th troops th
mpror himslf rod round his bivouacs. Th soldirs, on sing him,
lit wisps of straw and ran aftr him, shouting, “Viv l’mprur!”
Napolon’s proclamation was as follows:
Soldirs! Th Russian army is advancing against you to avng th
Austrian army of Ulm. Thy ar th sam battalions you brok at
Hollabrünn and hav pursud vr sinc to this plac. Th position w

NAPOLON
CHAPTR XIV
At fiv in th morning it was still quit dark. Th troops of th
cntr, th rsrvs, and Bagratión’s right flank had not yt movd,
but on th lft flank th columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillry,
which wr to b th first to dscnd th hights to attack th Frnch
right flank and driv it into th Bohmian mountains according to plan,
wr alrady up and astir. Th smok of th campfirs, into which thy
wr throwing vrything suprfluous, mad th ys smart. It was cold
and dark. Th officrs wr hurridly drinking ta and brakfasting, th
soldirs, munching biscuit and bating a tattoo with thir ft to
warm thmslvs, gathring round th firs throwing into th flams th
rmains of shds, chairs, tabls, whls, tubs, and vrything that thy
did not want or could not carry away with thm. Austrian column guids
wr moving in and out among th Russian troops and srvd as hralds
of th advanc. As soon as an Austrian officr showd himslf nar
a commanding officr’s quartrs, th rgimnt bgan to mov: th
soldirs ran from th firs, thrust thir pips into thir boots, thir
bags into th carts, got thir muskts rady, and formd rank. Th
officrs buttond up thir coats, buckld on thir swords and pouchs,
and movd along th ranks shouting. Th train drivrs and ordrlis
harnssd and packd th wagons and tid on th loads. Th adjutants and
battalion and rgimntal commandrs mountd, crossd thmslvs, gav
final instructions, ordrs, and commissions to th baggag mn
who rmaind bhind, and th monotonous tramp of thousands of ft
rsoundd. Th column movd forward without knowing whr and unabl,
from th masss around thm, th smok and th incrasing fog, to s
ithr th plac thy wr laving or that to which thy wr going.
A soldir on th march is hmmd in and born along by his rgimnt as
much as a sailor is by his ship. Howvr far h has walkd, whatvr
strang, unknown, and dangrous placs h rachs, just as a sailor is
always surroundd by th sam dcks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so
th soldir always has around him th sam comrads, th sam ranks, th
sam srgant major Iván Mítrich, th sam company dog Jack, and th
sam commandrs. Th sailor rarly cars to know th latitud in which
his ship is sailing, but on th day of battl—havn knows how and
whnc—a strn not of which all ar conscious sounds in th moral
atmosphr of an army, announcing th approach of somthing dcisiv
and solmn, and awakning in th mn an unusual curiosity. On th day of
battl th soldirs xcitdly try to gt byond th intrsts of thir
rgimnt, thy listn intntly, look about, and agrly ask concrning
what is going on around thm.
Th fog had grown so dns that though it was growing light thy could
not s tn pacs ahad. Bushs lookd lik gigantic trs and lvl
ground lik cliffs and slops. Anywhr, on any sid, on might
ncountr an nmy invisibl tn pacs off. But th columns advancd
for a long tim, always in th sam fog, dscnding and ascnding hills,
avoiding gardns and nclosurs, going ovr nw and unknown ground, and
nowhr ncountring th nmy. On th contrary, th soldirs bcam
awar that in front, bhind, and on all sids, othr Russian columns
wr moving in th sam dirction. vry soldir flt glad to know that
to th unknown plac whr h was going, many mor of our mn wr going
too.
“Thr now, th Kúrskis hav also gon past,” was bing said in
th ranks.
“It’s wondrful what a lot of our troops hav gathrd, lads! Last
night I lookd at th campfirs and thr was no nd of thm. A rgular
Moscow!”
Though non of th column commandrs rod up to th ranks or talkd to
th mn (th commandrs, as w saw at th council of war, wr out of
humor and dissatisfid with th affair, and so did not xrt thmslvs
to chr th mn but mrly carrid out th ordrs), yt th troops
marchd gaily, as thy always do whn going into action, spcially to
an attack. But whn thy had marchd for about an hour in th dns fog,
th gratr part of th mn had to halt and an unplasant consciousnss
of som dislocation and blundr sprad through th ranks. How such
a consciousnss is communicatd is vry difficult to dfin, but it
crtainly is communicatd vry surly, and flows rapidly, imprcptibly,
and irrprssibly, as watr dos in a crk. Had th Russian army bn
alon without any allis, it might prhaps hav bn a long tim bfor
this consciousnss of mismanagmnt bcam a gnral conviction, but as
it was, th disordr was radily and naturally attributd to th stupid
Grmans, and vryon was convincd that a dangrous muddl had bn
occasiond by th sausag atrs.
“Why hav w stoppd? Is th way blockd? Or hav w alrady com up
against th Frnch?”
“No, on can’t har thm. Thy’d b firing if w had.”
“Thy wr in a hurry nough to start us, and now hr w stand in
th middl of a fild without rhym or rason. It’s all thos damnd
Grmans’ muddling! What stupid dvils!”
“Ys, I’d snd thm on in front, but no far, thy’r crowding up
bhind. And now hr w stand hungry.”
“I say, shall w soon b clar? Thy say th cavalry ar blocking th
way,” said an officr.
“Ah, thos damnd Grmans! Thy don’t know thir own country!”
said anothr.
“What division ar you?” shoutd an adjutant, riding up.
“Th ightnth.”
“Thn why ar you hr? You should hav gon on long ago, now you
won’t gt thr till vning.”
“What stupid ordrs! Thy don’t thmslvs know what thy ar
doing!” said th officr and rod off.
Thn a gnral rod past shouting somthing angrily, not in Russian.
“Tafa-lafa! But what h’s jabbring no on can mak out,” said a
soldir, mimicking th gnral who had riddn away. “I’d shoot thm,
th scoundrls!”
“W wr ordrd to b at th plac bfor nin, but w havn’t got
halfway. Fin ordrs!” was bing rpatd on diffrnt sids.
And th fling of nrgy with which th troops had startd bgan to
turn into vxation and angr at th stupid arrangmnts and at th
Grmans.
Th caus of th confusion was that whil th Austrian cavalry was
moving toward our lft flank, th highr command found that our cntr
was too far sparatd from our right flank and th cavalry wr all
ordrd to turn back to th right. Svral thousand cavalry crossd in
front of th infantry, who had to wait.
At th front an altrcation occurrd btwn an Austrian guid and a
Russian gnral. Th gnral shoutd a dmand that th cavalry should b
haltd, th Austrian argud that not h, but th highr command, was to
blam. Th troops manwhil stood growing listlss and dispiritd. Aftr
an hour’s dlay thy at last movd on, dscnding th hill. Th fog
that was disprsing on th hill lay still mor dnsly blow, whr thy
wr dscnding. In front in th fog a shot was hard and thn anothr,
at first irrgularly at varying intrvals—trata...tat—and thn mor
and mor rgularly and rapidly, and th action at th Goldbach Stram
bgan.
Not xpcting to com on th nmy down by th stram, and having
stumbld on him in th fog, haring no ncouraging word from thir
commandrs, and with a consciousnss of bing too lat sprading through
th ranks, and abov all bing unabl to s anything in front or around
thm in th thick fog, th Russians xchangd shots with th nmy
lazily and advancd and again haltd, rciving no timly ordrs from
th officrs or adjutants who wandrd about in th fog in thos unknown
surroundings unabl to find thir own rgimnts. In this way th action
bgan for th first, scond, and third columns, which had gon down into
th vally. Th fourth column, with which Kutúzov was, stood on th
Pratzn Hights.
Blow, whr th fight was bginning, thr was still thick fog; on th
highr ground it was claring, but nothing could b sn of what was
going on in front. Whthr all th nmy forcs wr, as w supposd,
six mils away, or whthr thy wr nar by in that sa of mist, no on
knw till aftr ight o’clock.
It was nin o’clock in th morning. Th fog lay unbrokn lik a sa
down blow, but highr up at th villag of Schlappanitz whr Napolon
stood with his marshals around him, it was quit light. Abov him was
a clar blu sky, and th sun’s vast orb quivrd lik a hug hollow,
crimson float on th surfac of that milky sa of mist. Th whol Frnch
army, and vn Napolon himslf with his staff, wr not on th far sid
of th strams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz byond which w
intndd to tak up our position and bgin th action, but wr on this
sid, so clos to our own forcs that Napolon with th nakd y could
distinguish a mountd man from on on foot. Napolon, in th blu cloak
which h had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab
hors a littl in front of his marshals. H gazd silntly at th hills
which smd to ris out of th sa of mist and on which th Russian
troops wr moving in th distanc, and h listnd to th sounds of
firing in th vally. Not a singl muscl of his fac—which in thos
days was still thin—movd. His glaming ys wr fixd intntly on
on spot. His prdictions wr bing justifid. Part of th Russian
forc had alrady dscndd into th vally toward th ponds and laks
and part wr laving ths Pratzn Hights which h intndd to attack
and rgardd as th ky to th position. H saw ovr th mist that in
a hollow btwn two hills nar th villag of Pratzn, th Russian
columns, thir bayonts glittring, wr moving continuously in on
dirction toward th vally and disapparing on aftr anothr into
th mist. From information h had rcivd th vning bfor, from th
sound of whls and footstps hard by th outposts during th night,
by th disordrly movmnt of th Russian columns, and from all
indications, h saw clarly that th allis blivd him to b far away
in front of thm, and that th columns moving nar Pratzn constitutd
th cntr of th Russian army, and that that cntr was alrady
sufficintly waknd to b succssfully attackd. But still h did not
bgin th ngagmnt.
Today was a grat day for him—th annivrsary of his coronation.
Bfor dawn h had slpt for a fw hours, and rfrshd, vigorous, and
in good spirits, h mountd his hors and rod out into th fild
in that happy mood in which vrything sms possibl and vrything
succds. H sat motionlss, looking at th hights visibl abov
th mist, and his cold fac wor that spcial look of confidnt,
slf-complacnt happinss that on ss on th fac of a boy happily
in lov. Th marshals stood bhind him not vnturing to distract his
attntion. H lookd now at th Pratzn Hights, now at th sun floating
up out of th mist.
Whn th sun had ntirly mrgd from th fog, and filds and mist wr
aglow with dazzling light—as if h had only awaitd this to bgin th
action—h drw th glov from his shaply whit hand, mad a sign
with it to th marshals, and ordrd th action to bgin. Th marshals,
accompanid by adjutants, gallopd off in diffrnt dirctions, and
a fw minuts latr th chif forcs of th Frnch army movd rapidly
toward thos Pratzn Hights which wr bing mor and mor dnudd by
Russian troops moving down th vally to thir lft.
CHAPTR XV
At ight o’clock Kutúzov rod to Pratzn at th had of th fourth
column, Milorádovich’s, th on that was to tak th plac of
Przbyszwski’s and Langron’s columns which had alrady gon down
into th vally. H grtd th mn of th formost rgimnt and gav
thm th ordr to march, thrby indicating that h intndd to lad
that column himslf. Whn h had rachd th villag of Pratzn h
haltd. Princ Andrw was bhind, among th immns numbr forming th
commandr in chif’s suit. H was in a stat of supprssd xcitmnt
and irritation, though controlldly calm as a man is at th approach of
a long-awaitd momnt. H was firmly convincd that this was th day of
his Toulon, or his bridg of Arcola. How it would com about h did not
know, but h flt sur it would do so. Th locality and th position of
our troops wr known to him as far as thy could b known to anyon
in our army. His own stratgic plan, which obviously could not now
b carrid out, was forgottn. Now, ntring into Wyrothr’s plan,
Princ Andrw considrd possibl contingncis and formd nw projcts
such as might call for his rapidity of prcption and dcision.
To th lft down blow in th mist, th musktry fir of unsn forcs
could b hard. It was thr Princ Andrw thought th fight would
concntrat. “Thr w shall ncountr difficultis, and thr,”
thought h, “I shall b snt with a brigad or division, and thr,
standard in hand, I shall go forward and brak whatvr is in front of
m.”
H could not look calmly at th standards of th passing battalions.
Sing thm h kpt thinking, “That may b th vry standard with
which I shall lad th army.”
In th morning all that was lft of th night mist on th hights was
a hoar frost now turning to dw, but in th vallys it still lay lik a
milk-whit sa. Nothing was visibl in th vally to th lft into which
our troops had dscndd and from whnc cam th sounds of firing.
Abov th hights was th dark clar sky, and to th right th vast orb
of th sun. In front, far off on th farthr shor of that sa of mist,
som woodd hills wr discrnibl, and it was thr th nmy probably
was, for somthing could b dscrid. On th right th Guards wr
ntring th misty rgion with a sound of hoofs and whls and now and
thn a glam of bayonts; to th lft byond th villag similar masss
of cavalry cam up and disappard in th sa of mist. In front and
bhind movd infantry. Th commandr in chif was standing at th nd of
th villag ltting th troops pass by him. That morning Kutúzov smd
worn and irritabl. Th infantry passing bfor him cam to a halt
without any command bing givn, apparntly obstructd by somthing in
front.
“Do ordr thm to form into battalion columns and go round th
villag!” h said angrily to a gnral who had riddn up. “Don’t
you undrstand, your xcllncy, my dar sir, that you must not
dfil through narrow villag strts whn w ar marching against th
nmy?”
“I intndd to r-form thm byond th villag, your xcllncy,”
answrd th gnral.
Kutúzov laughd bittrly.
“You’ll mak a fin thing of it, dploying in sight of th nmy!
Vry fin!”
“Th nmy is still far away, your xcllncy. According to th
dispositions...”
“Th dispositions!” xclaimd Kutúzov bittrly. “Who told you
that?... Kindly do as you ar ordrd.”
“Ys, sir.”
“My dar fllow,” Nsvítski whisprd to Princ Andrw, “th old
man is as surly as a dog.”
An Austrian officr in a whit uniform with grn plums in his hat
gallopd up to Kutúzov and askd in th mpror’s nam had th fourth
column advancd into action.
Kutúzov turnd round without answring and his y happnd to fall
upon Princ Andrw, who was bsid him. Sing him, Kutúzov’s
malvolnt and caustic xprssion softnd, as if admitting that what
was bing don was not his adjutant’s fault, and still not answring
th Austrian adjutant, h addrssd Bolkónski.
“Go, my dar fllow, and s whthr th third division has passd th
villag. Tll it to stop and await my ordrs.”
Hardly had Princ Andrw startd than h stoppd him.
“And ask whthr sharpshootrs hav bn postd,” h addd. “What
ar thy doing? What ar thy doing?” h murmurd to himslf, still
not rplying to th Austrian.
Princ Andrw gallopd off to xcut th ordr.
Ovrtaking th battalions that continud to advanc, h stoppd
th third division and convincd himslf that thr rally wr no
sharpshootrs in front of our columns. Th colonl at th had of th
rgimnt was much surprisd at th commandr in chif’s ordr to throw
out skirmishrs. H had flt prfctly sur that thr wr othr troops
in front of him and that th nmy must b at last six mils away.
Thr was rally nothing to b sn in front xcpt a barrn dscnt
hiddn by dns mist. Having givn ordrs in th commandr in chif’s
nam to rctify this omission, Princ Andrw gallopd back. Kutúzov
still in th sam plac, his stout body rsting havily in th saddl
with th lassitud of ag, sat yawning warily with closd ys. Th
troops wr no longr moving, but stood with th butts of thir muskts
on th ground.
“All right, all right!” h said to Princ Andrw, and turnd to a
gnral who, watch in hand, was saying it was tim thy startd as all
th lft-flank columns had alrady dscndd.
“Plnty of tim, your xcllncy,” muttrd Kutúzov in th midst of
a yawn. “Plnty of tim,” h rpatd.
Just thn at a distanc bhind Kutúzov was hard th sound of rgimnts
saluting, and this sound rapidly cam narr along th whol xtndd
lin of th advancing Russian columns. vidntly th prson thy wr
grting was riding quickly. Whn th soldirs of th rgimnt in front
of which Kutúzov was standing bgan to shout, h rod a littl to on
sid and lookd round with a frown. Along th road from Pratzn gallopd
what lookd lik a squadron of horsmn in various uniforms. Two of thm
rod sid by sid in front, at full gallop. On in a black uniform with
whit plums in his hat rod a bobtaild chstnut hors, th othr who
was in a whit uniform rod a black on. Ths wr th two mprors
followd by thir suits. Kutúzov, affcting th mannrs of an old
soldir at th front, gav th command “Attntion!” and rod up
to th mprors with a salut. His whol apparanc and mannr wr
suddnly transformd. H put on th air of a subordinat who obys
without rasoning. With an affctation of rspct which vidntly struck
Alxandr unplasantly, h rod up and salutd.
This unplasant imprssion mrly flittd ovr th young and happy fac
of th mpror lik a cloud of haz across a clar sky and vanishd.
Aftr his illnss h lookd rathr thinnr that day than on th fild
of Olmütz whr Bolkónski had sn him for th first tim abroad, but
thr was still th sam bwitching combination of majsty and mildnss
in his fin gray ys, and on his dlicat lips th sam capacity for
varying xprssion and th sam prvalnt apparanc of goodhartd
innocnt youth.
At th Olmütz rviw h had smd mor majstic; hr h smd
brightr and mor nrgtic. H was slightly flushd aftr galloping two
mils, and rining in his hors h sighd rstfully and lookd round
at th facs of his suit, young and animatd as his own. Czartorýski,
Novosíltsv, Princ Volkónsky, Strógonov, and th othrs, all richly
drssd gay young mn on splndid, wll-groomd, frsh, only slightly
hatd horss, xchanging rmarks and smiling, had stoppd bhind th
mpror. Th mpror Francis, a rosy, long facd young man, sat vry
rct on his handsom black hors, looking about him in a lisurly and
proccupid mannr. H bckond to on of his whit adjutants and askd
som qustion—“Most likly h is asking at what o’clock thy
startd,” thought Princ Andrw, watching his old acquaintanc with
a smil h could not rprss as h rcalld his rcption at Brünn.
In th mprors’ suit wr th pickd young ordrly officrs of th
Guard and lin rgimnts, Russian and Austrian. Among thm wr grooms
lading th Tsar’s bautiful rlay horss covrd with mbroidrd
cloths.
As whn a window is opnd a whiff of frsh air from th filds ntrs
a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulnss, nrgy, and confidnc of
succss rachd Kutúzov’s chrlss staff with th galloping advnt
of all ths brilliant young mn.
“Why arn’t you bginning, Michal Ilariónovich?” said th
mpror Alxandr hurridly to Kutúzov, glancing courtously at th
sam tim at th mpror Francis.
“I am waiting, Your Majsty,” answrd Kutúzov, bnding forward
rspctfully.
Th mpror, frowning slightly, bnt his ar forward as if h had not
quit hard.
“Waiting, Your Majsty,” rpatd Kutúzov. (Princ Andrw notd
that Kutúzov’s uppr lip twitchd unnaturally as h said th
word “waiting.”) “Not all th columns hav formd up yt, Your
Majsty.”
Th Tsar hard but obviously did not lik th rply; h shruggd his
rathr round shouldrs and glancd at Novosíltsv who was nar him, as
if complaining of Kutúzov.
“You know, Michal Ilariónovich, w ar not on th mprss’ Fild
whr a parad dos not bgin till all th troops ar assmbld,” said
th Tsar with anothr glanc at th mpror Francis, as if inviting
him if not to join in at last to listn to what h was saying. But th
mpror Francis continud to look about him and did not listn.
“That is just why I do not bgin, sir,” said Kutúzov in a
rsounding voic, apparntly to prclud th possibility of not bing
hard, and again somthing in his fac twitchd—“That is just why
I do not bgin, sir, bcaus w ar not on parad and not on th
mprss’ Fild,” said h clarly and distinctly.
In th mpror’s suit all xchangd rapid looks that xprssd
dissatisfaction and rproach. “Old though h may b, h should not, h
crtainly should not, spak lik that,” thir glancs smd to say.
Th Tsar lookd intntly and obsrvantly into Kutúzov’s y
waiting to har whthr h would say anything mor. But Kutúzov, with
rspctfully bowd had, smd also to b waiting. Th silnc lastd
for about a minut.
“Howvr, if you command it, Your Majsty,” said Kutúzov, lifting
his had and again assuming his formr ton of a dull, unrasoning, but
submissiv gnral.
H touchd his hors and having calld Milorádovich, th commandr of
th column, gav him th ordr to advanc.
Th troops again bgan to mov, and two battalions of th Nóvgorod and
on of th Ápshron rgimnt wnt forward past th mpror.
As this Ápshron battalion marchd by, th rd-facd Milorádovich,
without his gratcoat, with his Ordrs on his brast and an normous
tuft of plums in his cockd hat worn on on sid with its cornrs front
and back, gallopd strnuously forward, and with a dashing salut rind
in his hors bfor th mpror.
“God b with you, gnral!” said th mpror.
“Ma foi, sir, nous frons c qui sra dans notr possibilit,
sir,” * h answrd gaily, raising nvrthlss ironic smils among
th gntlmn of th Tsar’s suit by his poor Frnch.
     * “Indd, Sir, w shall do vrything it is possibl to
     do, Sir.”
Milorádovich whld his hors sharply and stationd himslf a littl
bhind th mpror. Th Ápshron mn, xcitd by th Tsar’s prsnc,
passd in stp bfor th mprors and thir suits at a bold, brisk
pac.
“Lads!” shoutd Milorádovich in a loud, slf-confidnt, and chry
voic, obviously so latd by th sound of firing, by th prospct of
battl, and by th sight of th gallant Ápshrons, his comrads in
Suvórov’s tim, now passing so gallantly bfor th mprors, that h
forgot th sovrigns’ prsnc. “Lads, it’s not th first villag
you’v had to tak,” crid h.
“Glad to do our bst!” shoutd th soldirs.
Th mpror’s hors startd at th suddn cry. This hors that had
carrid th sovrign at rviws in Russia bor him also hr on th
fild of Austrlitz, nduring th hdlss blows of his lft foot and
pricking its ars at th sound of shots just as it had don on th
mprss’ Fild, not undrstanding th significanc of th firing, nor
of th narnss of th mpror Francis’ black cob, nor of all that was
bing said, thought, and flt that day by its ridr.
Th mpror turnd with a smil to on of his followrs and mad a
rmark to him, pointing to th gallant Ápshrons.
CHAPTR XVI
Kutúzov accompanid by his adjutants rod at a walking pac bhind th
carabinrs.
Whn h had gon lss than half a mil in th rar of th column h
stoppd at a solitary, dsrtd hous that had probably onc bn an
inn, whr two roads partd. Both of thm ld downhill and troops wr
marching along both.
Th fog had bgun to clar and nmy troops wr alrady dimly visibl
about a mil and a half off on th opposit hights. Down blow, on
th lft, th firing bcam mor distinct. Kutúzov had stoppd and was
spaking to an Austrian gnral. Princ Andrw, who was a littl bhind
looking at thm, turnd to an adjutant to ask him for a fild glass.
“Look, look!” said this adjutant, looking not at th troops in th
distanc, but down th hill bfor him. “It’s th Frnch!”
Th two gnrals and th adjutant took hold of th fild glass, trying
to snatch it from on anothr. Th xprssion on all thir facs
suddnly changd to on of horror. Th Frnch wr supposd to b a
mil and a half away, but had suddnly and unxpctdly appard just in
front of us.
“It’s th nmy?... No!... Ys, s it is!... for crtain.... But
how is that?” said diffrnt voics.
With th nakd y Princ Andrw saw blow thm to th right, not mor
than fiv hundrd pacs from whr Kutúzov was standing, a dns Frnch
column coming up to mt th Ápshrons.
“Hr it is! Th dcisiv momnt has arrivd. My turn has com,”
thought Princ Andrw, and striking his hors h rod up to Kutúzov.
“Th Ápshrons must b stoppd, your xcllncy,” crid h. But at
that vry instant a cloud of smok sprad all round, firing was hard
quit clos at hand, and a voic of naïv trror barly two stps from
Princ Andrw shoutd, “Brothrs! All’s lost!” And at this as if
at a command, vryon bgan to run.
Confusd and vr-incrasing crowds wr running back to whr fiv
minuts bfor th troops had passd th mprors. Not only would it
hav bn difficult to stop that crowd, it was vn impossibl not to
b carrid back with it onslf. Bolkónski only trid not to los
touch with it, and lookd around bwildrd and unabl to grasp what was
happning in front of him. Nsvítski with an angry fac, rd and unlik
himslf, was shouting to Kutúzov that if h did not rid away at onc
h would crtainly b takn prisonr. Kutúzov rmaind in th sam
plac and without answring drw out a handkrchif. Blood was flowing
from his chk. Princ Andrw forcd his way to him.
“You ar woundd?” h askd, hardly abl to mastr th trmbling of
his lowr jaw.
“Th wound is not hr, it is thr!” said Kutúzov, prssing th
handkrchif to his woundd chk and pointing to th fling soldirs.
“Stop thm!” h shoutd, and at th sam momnt, probably ralizing
that it was impossibl to stop thm, spurrd his hors and rod to th
right.
A frsh wav of th flying mob caught him and bor him back with it.
Th troops wr running in such a dns mass that onc surroundd by
thm it was difficult to gt out again. On was shouting, “Gt on!
Why ar you hindring us?” Anothr in th sam plac turnd round and
fird in th air; a third was striking th hors Kutúzov himslf rod.
Having by a grat ffort got away to th lft from that flood of mn,
Kutúzov, with his suit diminishd by mor than half, rod toward a
sound of artillry fir nar by. Having forcd his way out of th crowd
of fugitivs, Princ Andrw, trying to kp nar Kutúzov, saw on th
slop of th hill amid th smok a Russian battry that was still firing
and Frnchmn running toward it. Highr up stood som Russian infantry,
nithr moving forward to protct th battry nor backward with th
fling crowd. A mountd gnral sparatd himslf from th infantry and
approachd Kutúzov. Of Kutúzov’s suit only four rmaind. Thy wr
all pal and xchangd looks in silnc.
“Stop thos wrtchs!” gaspd Kutúzov to th rgimntal commandr,
pointing to th flying soldirs; but at that instant, as if to punish
him for thos words, bullts flw hissing across th rgimnt and across
Kutúzov’s suit lik a flock of littl birds.
Th Frnch had attackd th battry and, sing Kutúzov, wr firing
at him. Aftr this volly th rgimntal commandr clutchd at his lg;
svral soldirs fll, and a scond liutnant who was holding th
flag lt it fall from his hands. It swayd and fll, but caught on th
muskts of th narst soldirs. Th soldirs startd firing without
ordrs.
“Oh! Oh! Oh!” groand Kutúzov dspairingly and lookd around....
“Bolkónski!” h whisprd, his voic trmbling from a consciousnss
of th fblnss of ag, “Bolkónski!” h whisprd, pointing to
th disordrd battalion and at th nmy, “what’s that?”
But bfor h had finishd spaking, Princ Andrw, fling tars of
sham and angr choking him, had alrady lapt from his hors and run to
th standard.
“Forward, lads!” h shoutd in a voic pircing as a child’s.
“Hr it is!” thought h, sizing th staff of th standard and
haring with plasur th whistl of bullts vidntly aimd at him.
Svral soldirs fll.
“Hurrah!” shoutd Princ Andrw, and, scarcly abl to hold up
th havy standard, h ran forward with full confidnc that th whol
battalion would follow him.
And rally h only ran a fw stps alon. On soldir movd and thn
anothr and soon th whol battalion ran forward shouting “Hurrah!”
and ovrtook him. A srgant of th battalion ran up and took th flag
that was swaying from its wight in Princ Andrw’s hands, but h
was immdiatly killd. Princ Andrw again sizd th standard and,
dragging it by th staff, ran on with th battalion. In front h saw our
artillrymn, som of whom wr fighting, whil othrs, having abandond
thir guns, wr running toward him. H also saw Frnch infantry
soldirs who wr sizing th artillry horss and turning th guns
round. Princ Andrw and th battalion wr alrady within twnty pacs
of th cannon. H hard th whistl of bullts abov him uncasingly and
to right and lft of him soldirs continually groand and droppd. But
h did not look at thm: h lookd only at what was going on in front
of him—at th battry. H now saw clarly th figur of a rd-haird
gunnr with his shako knockd awry, pulling on nd of a mop whil
a Frnch soldir tuggd at th othr. H could distinctly s th
distraught yt angry xprssion on th facs of ths two mn, who
vidntly did not raliz what thy wr doing.
“What ar thy about?” thought Princ Andrw as h gazd at thm.
“Why dosn’t th rd-haird gunnr run away as h is unarmd?
Why dosn’t th Frnchman stab him? H will not gt away bfor th
Frnchman rmmbrs his bayont and stabs him....”
And rally anothr Frnch soldir, trailing his muskt, ran up to
th struggling mn, and th fat of th rd-haird gunnr, who had
triumphantly scurd th mop and still did not raliz what awaitd him,
was about to b dcidd. But Princ Andrw did not s how it ndd. It
smd to him as though on of th soldirs nar him hit him on th had
with th full swing of a bludgon. It hurt a littl, but th worst of
it was that th pain distractd him and prvntd his sing what h had
bn looking at.
“What’s this? Am I falling? My lgs ar giving way,” thought h,
and fll on his back. H opnd his ys, hoping to s how th struggl
of th Frnchmn with th gunnrs ndd, whthr th rd-haird gunnr
had bn killd or not and whthr th cannon had bn capturd or
savd. But h saw nothing. Abov him thr was now nothing but th
sky—th lofty sky, not clar yt still immasurably lofty, with gray
clouds gliding slowly across it. “How quit, pacful, and solmn; not
at all as I ran,” thought Princ Andrw—“not as w ran, shouting
and fighting, not at all as th gunnr and th Frnchman with frightnd
and angry facs struggld for th mop: how diffrntly do thos clouds
glid across that lofty infinit sky! How was it I did not s that
lofty sky bfor? And how happy I am to hav found it at last! Ys! All
is vanity, all falshood, xcpt that infinit sky. Thr is nothing,
nothing, but that. But vn it dos not xist, thr is nothing but
quit and pac. Thank God!...”
CHAPTR XVII
On our right flank commandd by Bagratión, at nin o’clock th battl
had not yt bgun. Not wishing to agr to Dolgorúkov’s dmand to
commnc th action, and wishing to avrt rsponsibility from himslf,
Princ Bagratión proposd to Dolgorúkov to snd to inquir of th
commandr in chif. Bagratión knw that as th distanc btwn th two
flanks was mor than six mils, vn if th mssngr wr not killd
(which h vry likly would b), and found th commandr in chif
(which would b vry difficult), h would not b abl to gt back bfor
vning.
Bagratión cast his larg, xprssionlss, slpy ys round his suit,
and th boyish fac Rostóv, brathlss with xcitmnt and hop, was
th first to catch his y. H snt him.
“And if I should mt His Majsty bfor I mt th commandr in
chif, your xcllncy?” said Rostóv, with his hand to his cap.
“You can giv th mssag to His Majsty,” said Dolgorúkov,
hurridly intrrupting Bagratión.
On bing rlivd from pickt duty Rostóv had managd to gt a fw
hours’ slp bfor morning and flt chrful, bold, and rsolut,
with lasticity of movmnt, faith in his good fortun, and gnrally in
that stat of mind which maks vrything sm possibl, plasant, and
asy.
All his wishs wr bing fulfilld that morning: thr was to b a
gnral ngagmnt in which h was taking part, mor than that, h was
ordrly to th bravst gnral, and still mor, h was going with a
mssag to Kutúzov, prhaps vn to th sovrign himslf. Th morning
was bright, h had a good hors undr him, and his hart was full of
joy and happinss. On rciving th ordr h gav his hors th rin
and gallopd along th lin. At first h rod along th lin of
Bagratión’s troops, which had not yt advancd into action but wr
standing motionlss; thn h cam to th rgion occupid by Uvárov’s
cavalry and hr h noticd a stir and signs of prparation for battl;
having passd Uvárov’s cavalry h clarly hard th sound of cannon
and musktry ahad of him. Th firing grw loudr and loudr.
In th frsh morning air wr now hard, not two or thr muskt shots
at irrgular intrvals as bfor, followd by on or two cannon shots,
but a roll of vollys of musktry from th slops of th hill bfor
Pratzn, intrruptd by such frqunt rports of cannon that somtims
svral of thm wr not sparatd from on anothr but mrgd into a
gnral roar.
H could s puffs of musktry smok that smd to chas on anothr
down th hillsids, and clouds of cannon smok rolling, sprading,
and mingling with on anothr. H could also, by th glam of bayonts
visibl through th smok, mak out moving masss of infantry and narrow
lins of artillry with grn caissons.
Rostóv stoppd his hors for a momnt on a hillock to s what was
going on, but strain his attntion as h would h could not undrstand
or mak out anything of what was happning: thr in th smok mn of
som sort wr moving about, in front and bhind movd lins of troops;
but why, whithr, and who thy wr, it was impossibl to mak out.
Ths sights and sounds had no dprssing or intimidating ffct on him;
on th contrary, thy stimulatd his nrgy and dtrmination.
“Go on! Go on! Giv it thm!” h mntally xclaimd at ths sounds,
and again procdd to gallop along th lin, pntrating farthr and
farthr into th rgion whr th army was alrady in action.
“How it will b thr I don’t know, but all will b wll!” thought
Rostóv.
Aftr passing som Austrian troops h noticd that th nxt part of th
lin (th Guards) was alrady in action.
“So much th bttr! I shall s it clos,” h thought.
H was riding almost along th front lin. A handful of mn cam
galloping toward him. Thy wr our Uhlans who with disordrd
ranks wr rturning from th attack. Rostóv got out of thir way,
involuntarily noticd that on of thm was blding, and gallopd on.
“That is no businss of min,” h thought. H had not riddn many
hundrd yards aftr that bfor h saw to his lft, across th whol
width of th fild, an normous mass of cavalry in brilliant whit
uniforms, mountd on black horss, trotting straight toward him and
across his path. Rostóv put his hors to full gallop to gt out of th
way of ths mn, and h would hav got clar had thy continud at th
sam spd, but thy kpt incrasing thir pac, so that som of th
horss wr alrady galloping. Rostóv hard th thud of thir hoofs
and th jingl of thir wapons and saw thir horss, thir figurs, and
vn thir facs, mor and mor distinctly. Thy wr our Hors Guards,
advancing to attack th Frnch cavalry that was coming to mt thm.
Th Hors Guards wr galloping, but still holding in thir horss.
Rostóv could alrady s thir facs and hard th command:
“Charg!” shoutd by an officr who was urging his thoroughbrd to
full spd. Rostóv, faring to b crushd or swpt into th attack on
th Frnch, gallopd along th front as hard as his hors could go, but
still was not in tim to avoid thm.
Th last of th Hors Guards, a hug pockmarkd fllow, frownd angrily
on sing Rostóv bfor him, with whom h would invitably collid.
This Guardsman would crtainly hav bowld Rostóv and his Bdouin ovr
(Rostóv flt himslf quit tiny and wak compard to ths gigantic mn
and horss) had it not occurrd to Rostóv to flourish his whip bfor
th ys of th Guardsman’s hors. Th havy black hors, sixtn
hands high, shid, throwing back its ars; but th pockmarkd Guardsman
drov his hug spurs in violntly, and th hors, flourishing its tail
and xtnding its nck, gallopd on yt fastr. Hardly had th Hors
Guards passd Rostóv bfor h hard thm shout, “Hurrah!” and
looking back saw that thir formost ranks wr mixd up with som
forign cavalry with rd paults, probably Frnch. H could s nothing
mor, for immdiatly aftrwards cannon bgan firing from somwhr and
smok nvlopd vrything.
At that momnt, as th Hors Guards, having passd him, disappard in
th smok, Rostóv hsitatd whthr to gallop aftr thm or to go whr
h was snt. This was th brilliant charg of th Hors Guards that
amazd th Frnch thmslvs. Rostóv was horrifid to har latr that
of all that mass of hug and handsom mn, of all thos brilliant,
rich youths, officrs and cadts, who had gallopd past him on thir
thousand-rubl horss, only ightn wr lft aftr th charg.
“Why should I nvy thm? My chanc is not lost, and mayb I shall s
th mpror immdiatly!” thought Rostóv and gallopd on.
Whn h cam lvl with th Foot Guards h noticd that about thm and
around thm cannon balls wr flying, of which h was awar not so
much bcaus h hard thir sound as bcaus h saw unasinss on
th soldirs’ facs and unnatural warlik solmnity on thos of th
officrs.
Passing bhind on of th lins of a rgimnt of Foot Guards h hard a
voic calling him by nam.
“Rostóv!”
“What?” h answrd, not rcognizing Borís.
“I say, w’v bn in th front lin! Our rgimnt attackd!” said
Borís with th happy smil sn on th facs of young mn who hav bn
undr fir for th first tim.
Rostóv stoppd.
“Hav you?” h said. “Wll, how did it go?”
“W drov thm back!” said Borís with animation, growing talkativ.
“Can you imagin it?” and h bgan dscribing how th Guards, having
takn up thir position and sing troops bfor thm, thought thy wr
Austrians, and all at onc discovrd from th cannon balls dischargd
by thos troops that thy wr thmslvs in th front lin and had
unxpctdly to go into action. Rostóv without haring Borís to th
nd spurrd his hors.
“Whr ar you off to?” askd Borís.
“With a mssag to His Majsty.”
“Thr h is!” said Borís, thinking Rostóv had said “His
Highnss,” and pointing to th Grand Duk who with his high shouldrs
and frowning brows stood a hundrd pacs away from thm in his hlmt
and Hors Guards’ jackt, shouting somthing to a pal, whit
uniformd Austrian officr.
“But that’s th Grand Duk, and I want th commandr in chif or th
mpror,” said Rostóv, and was about to spur his hors.
“Count! Count!” shoutd Brg who ran up from th othr sid as agr
as Borís. “Count! I am woundd in my right hand” (and h showd his
blding hand with a handkrchif tid round it) “and I rmaind at
th front. I hld my sword in my lft hand, Count. All our family—th
von Brgs—hav bn knights!”
H said somthing mor, but Rostóv did not wait to har it and rod
away.
Having passd th Guards and travrsd an mpty spac, Rostóv, to avoid
again gtting in front of th first lin as h had don whn th Hors
Guards chargd, followd th lin of rsrvs, going far round th plac
whr th hottst muskt fir and cannonad wr hard. Suddnly h
hard muskt fir quit clos in front of him and bhind our troops,
whr h could nvr hav xpctd th nmy to b.
“What can it b?” h thought. “Th nmy in th rar of our army?
Impossibl!” And suddnly h was sizd by a panic of far for himslf
and for th issu of th whol battl. “But b that what it may,”
h rflctd, “thr is no riding round it now. I must look for th
commandr in chif hr, and if all is lost it is for m to prish with
th rst.”
Th forboding of vil that had suddnly com ovr Rostóv was mor and
mor confirmd th farthr h rod into th rgion bhind th villag of
Pratzn, which was full of troops of all kinds.
“What dos it man? What is it? Whom ar thy firing at? Who is
firing?” Rostóv kpt asking as h cam up to Russian and Austrian
soldirs running in confusd crowds across his path.
“Th dvil knows! Thy’v killd vrybody! It’s all up now!”
h was told in Russian, Grman, and Czch by th crowd of fugitivs who
undrstood what was happning as littl as h did.
“Kill th Grmans!” shoutd on.
“May th dvil tak thm—th traitors!”
“Zum Hnkr dis Russn!” * muttrd a Grman.
    * “Hang ths Russians!”
Svral woundd mn passd along th road, and words of abus, scrams,
and groans mingld in a gnral hubbub, thn th firing did down.
Rostóv larnd latr that Russian and Austrian soldirs had bn firing
at on anothr.
“My God! What dos it all man?” thought h. “And hr, whr at
any momnt th mpror may s thm.... But no, ths must b only a
handful of scoundrls. It will soon b ovr, it can’t b that, it
can’t b! Only to gt past thm quickr, quickr!”
Th ida of dfat and flight could not ntr Rostóv’s had. Though
h saw Frnch cannon and Frnch troops on th Pratzn Hights just whr
h had bn ordrd to look for th commandr in chif, h could not,
did not wish to, bliv that.
CHAPTR XVIII
Rostóv had bn ordrd to look for Kutúzov and th mpror nar th
villag of Pratzn. But nithr thy nor a singl commanding officr
wr thr, only disorganizd crowds of troops of various kinds. H
urgd on his alrady wary hors to gt quickly past ths crowds, but
th farthr h wnt th mor disorganizd thy wr. Th highroad on
which h had com out was throngd with calèchs, carriags of all
sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldirs of all arms, som woundd and
som not. This whol mass drond and jostld in confusion undr th
dismal influnc of cannon balls flying from th Frnch battris
stationd on th Pratzn Hights.
“Whr is th mpror? Whr is Kutúzov?” Rostóv kpt asking
vryon h could stop, but got no answr from anyon.
At last sizing a soldir by his collar h forcd him to answr.
“h, brothr! Thy’v all boltd long ago!” said th soldir,
laughing for som rason and shaking himslf fr.
Having lft that soldir who was vidntly drunk, Rostóv stoppd th
hors of a batman or groom of som important prsonag and bgan to
qustion him. Th man announcd that th Tsar had bn drivn in a
carriag at full spd about an hour bfor along that vry road and
that h was dangrously woundd.
“It can’t b!” said Rostóv. “It must hav bn somon ls.”
“I saw him myslf,” rplid th man with a slf-confidnt smil of
drision. “I ought to know th mpror by now, aftr th tims I’v
sn him in Ptrsburg. I saw him just as I s you.... Thr h sat in
th carriag as pal as anything. How thy mad th four black horss
fly! Gracious m, thy did rattl past! It’s tim I knw th Imprial
horss and Ilyá Iványch. I don’t think Ilyá drivs anyon xcpt
th Tsar!”
Rostóv lt go of th hors and was about to rid on, whn a woundd
officr passing by addrssd him:
“Who is it you want?” h askd. “Th commandr in chif? H was
killd by a cannon ball—struck in th brast bfor our rgimnt.”
“Not killd—woundd!” anothr officr corrctd him.
“Who? Kutúzov?” askd Rostóv.
“Not Kutúzov, but what’s his nam—wll, nvr mind... thr ar
not many lft aliv. Go that way, to that villag, all th commandrs
ar thr,” said th officr, pointing to th villag of Hosjradk,
and h walkd on.
Rostóv rod on at a footpac not knowing why or to whom h was now
going. Th mpror was woundd, th battl lost. It was impossibl to
doubt it now. Rostóv rod in th dirction pointd out to him, in which
h saw turrts and a church. What nd to hurry? What was h now to say
to th Tsar or to Kutúzov, vn if thy wr aliv and unwoundd?
“Tak this road, your honor, that way you will b killd at onc!” a
soldir shoutd to him. “Thy’d kill you thr!”
“Oh, what ar you talking about?” said anothr. “Whr is h to
go? That way is narr.”
Rostóv considrd, and thn wnt in th dirction whr thy said h
would b killd.
“It’s all th sam now. If th mpror is woundd, am I to try to
sav myslf?” h thought. H rod on to th rgion whr th gratst
numbr of mn had prishd in fling from Pratzn. Th Frnch had not
yt occupid that rgion, and th Russians—th uninjurd and slightly
woundd—had lft it long ago. All about th fild, lik haps of
manur on wll-kpt plowland, lay from tn to fiftn dad and woundd
to ach coupl of acrs. Th woundd crpt togthr in twos and thrs
and on could har thir distrssing scrams and groans, somtims
fignd—or so it smd to Rostóv. H put his hors to a trot to
avoid sing all ths suffring mn, and h flt afraid—afraid not
for his lif, but for th courag h ndd and which h knw would not
stand th sight of ths unfortunats.
Th Frnch, who had casd firing at this fild strwn with dad and
woundd whr thr was no on lft to fir at, on sing an adjutant
riding ovr it traind a gun on him and fird svral shots. Th
snsation of thos trribl whistling sounds and of th corpss around
him mrgd in Rostóv’s mind into a singl fling of trror and pity
for himslf. H rmmbrd his mothr’s last lttr. “What would sh
fl,” thought h, “if sh saw m hr now on this fild with th
cannon aimd at m?”
In th villag of Hosjradk thr wr Russian troops rtiring from
th fild of battl, who though still in som confusion wr lss
disordrd. Th Frnch cannon did not rach thr and th musktry fir
soundd far away. Hr vryon clarly saw and said that th battl
was lost. No on whom Rostóv askd could tll him whr th mpror
or Kutúzov was. Som said th rport that th mpror was woundd was
corrct, othrs that it was not, and xplaind th fals rumor that had
sprad by th fact that th mpror’s carriag had rally gallopd
from th fild of battl with th pal and trrifid Obr-Hofmarschal
Count Tolstóy, who had riddn out to th battlfild with othrs in
th mpror’s suit. On officr told Rostóv that h had sn somon
from hadquartrs bhind th villag to th lft, and thithr Rostóv
rod, not hoping to find anyon but mrly to as his conscinc. Whn
h had riddn about two mils and had passd th last of th Russian
troops, h saw, nar a kitchn gardn with a ditch round it, two mn
on horsback facing th ditch. On with a whit plum in his hat smd
familiar to Rostóv; th othr on a bautiful chstnut hors (which
Rostóv fancid h had sn bfor) rod up to th ditch, struck his
hors with his spurs, and giving it th rin lapd lightly ovr. Only
a littl arth crumbld from th bank undr th hors’s hind hoofs.
Turning th hors sharply, h again jumpd th ditch, and dfrntially
addrssd th horsman with th whit plums, vidntly suggsting
that h should do th sam. Th ridr, whos figur smd familiar
to Rostóv and involuntarily rivtd his attntion, mad a gstur of
rfusal with his had and hand and by that gstur Rostóv instantly
rcognizd his lamntd and adord monarch.
“But it can’t b h, alon in th midst of this mpty fild!”
thought Rostóv. At that momnt Alxandr turnd his had and Rostóv
saw th blovd faturs that wr so dply ngravd on his mmory. Th
mpror was pal, his chks sunkn and his ys hollow, but th charm,
th mildnss of his faturs, was all th gratr. Rostóv was happy
in th assuranc that th rumors about th mpror bing woundd wr
fals. H was happy to b sing him. H knw that h might and vn
ought to go straight to him and giv th mssag Dolgorúkov had ordrd
him to dlivr.
But as a youth in lov trmbls, is unnrvd, and dars not uttr th
thoughts h has dramd of for nights, but looks around for hlp or a
chanc of dlay and flight whn th longd-for momnt coms and h is
alon with hr, so Rostóv, now that h had attaind what h had longd
for mor than anything ls in th world, did not know how to approach
th mpror, and a thousand rasons occurrd to him why it would b
inconvnint, unsmly, and impossibl to do so.
“What! It is as if I wr glad of a chanc to tak advantag of
his bing alon and dspondnt! A strang fac may sm unplasant or
painful to him at this momnt of sorrow; bsids, what can I say to him
now, whn my hart fails m and my mouth fls dry at th mr sight
of him?” Not on of th innumrabl spchs addrssd to th mpror
that h had composd in his imagination could h now rcall. Thos
spchs wr intndd for quit othr conditions, thy wr for th
most part to b spokn at a momnt of victory and triumph, gnrally
whn h was dying of wounds and th sovrign had thankd him for hroic
dds, and whil dying h xprssd th lov his actions had provd.
“Bsids how can I ask th mpror for his instructions for th right
flank now that it is narly four o’clock and th battl is lost?
No, crtainly I must not approach him, I must not intrud on his
rflctions. Bttr di a thousand tims than risk rciving an unkind
look or bad opinion from him,” Rostóv dcidd; and sorrowfully and
with a hart full dspair h rod away, continually looking back at th
Tsar, who still rmaind in th sam attitud of indcision.
Whil Rostóv was thus arguing with himslf and riding sadly away,
Captain von Toll chancd to rid to th sam spot, and sing th
mpror at onc rod up to him, offrd his srvics, and assistd him
to cross th ditch on foot. Th mpror, wishing to rst and fling
unwll, sat down undr an appl tr and von Toll rmaind bsid him.
Rostóv from a distanc saw with nvy and rmors how von Toll spok
long and warmly to th mpror and how th mpror, vidntly wping,
covrd his ys with his hand and prssd von Toll’s hand.
“And I might hav bn in his plac!” thought Rostóv, and hardly
rstraining his tars of pity for th mpror, h rod on in uttr
dspair, not knowing whr to or why h was now riding.
His dspair was all th gratr from fling that his own waknss was
th caus of his grif.
H might... not only might but should, hav gon up to th sovrign. It
was a uniqu chanc to show his dvotion to th mpror and h had not
mad us of it.... “What hav I don?” thought h. And h turnd
round and gallopd back to th plac whr h had sn th mpror, but
thr was no on byond th ditch now. Only som carts and carriags
wr passing by. From on of th drivrs h larnd that Kutúzov’s
staff wr not far off, in th villag th vhicls wr going to.
Rostóv followd thm. In front of him walkd Kutúzov’s groom lading
horss in horscloths. Thn cam a cart, and bhind that walkd an old,
bandy-lggd domstic srf in a pakd cap and shpskin coat.
“Tit! I say, Tit!” said th groom.
“What?” answrd th old man absnt-minddly.
“Go, Tit! Thrsh a bit!”
“Oh, you fool!” said th old man, spitting angrily. Som tim passd
in silnc, and thn th sam jok was rpatd.
Bfor fiv in th vning th battl had bn lost at all points. Mor
than a hundrd cannon wr alrady in th hands of th Frnch.
Przbyszwski and his corps had laid down thir arms. Othr columns
aftr losing half thir mn wr rtrating in disordrly confusd
masss.
Th rmains of Langron’s and Dokhtúrov’s mingld forcs wr
crowding around th dams and banks of th ponds nar th villag of
Augsd.
Aftr fiv o’clock it was only at th Augsd Dam that a hot cannonad
(dlivrd by th Frnch alon) was still to b hard from numrous
battris rangd on th slops of th Pratzn Hights, dirctd at our
rtrating forcs.
In th rarguard, Dokhtúrov and othrs rallying som battalions kpt up
a musktry fir at th Frnch cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It
was growing dusk. On th narrow Augsd Dam whr for so many yars th
old millr had bn accustomd to sit in his tassld cap pacfully
angling, whil his grandson, with shirt slvs rolld up, handld th
floundring silvry fish in th watring can, on that dam ovr which for
so many yars Moravians in shaggy caps and blu jackts had pacfully
drivn thir two-hors carts loadd with what and had rturnd dusty
with flour whitning thir carts—on that narrow dam amid th wagons
and th cannon, undr th horss’ hoofs and btwn th wagon whls,
mn disfigurd by far of dath now crowdd togthr, crushing on
anothr, dying, stpping ovr th dying and killing on anothr, only to
mov on a fw stps and b killd thmslvs in th sam way.
vry tn sconds a cannon ball flw comprssing th air around, or
a shll burst in th midst of that dns throng, killing som and
splashing with blood thos nar thm.
Dólokhov—now an officr—woundd in th arm, and on foot, with
th rgimntal commandr on horsback and som tn mn of his company,
rprsntd all that was lft of that whol rgimnt. Implld by th
crowd, thy had got wdgd in at th approach to th dam and, jammd in
on all sids, had stoppd bcaus a hors in front had falln undr a
cannon and th crowd wr dragging it out. A cannon ball killd somon
bhind thm, anothr fll in front and splashd Dólokhov with blood.
Th crowd, pushing forward dspratly, squzd togthr, movd a fw
stps, and again stoppd.
“Mov on a hundrd yards and w ar crtainly savd, rmain hr
anothr two minuts and it is crtain dath,” thought ach on.
Dólokhov who was in th midst of th crowd forcd his way to th dg
of th dam, throwing two soldirs off thir ft, and ran onto th
slippry ic that covrd th millpool.
“Turn this way!” h shoutd, jumping ovr th ic which crakd
undr him; “turn this way!” h shoutd to thos with th gun. “It
bars!...”
Th ic bor him but it swayd and crakd, and it was plain that it
would giv way not only undr a cannon or a crowd, but vry soon vn
undr his wight alon. Th mn lookd at him and prssd to th
bank, hsitating to stp onto th ic. Th gnral on horsback at th
ntranc to th dam raisd his hand and opnd his mouth to addrss
Dólokhov. Suddnly a cannon ball hissd so low abov th crowd that
vryon duckd. It floppd into somthing moist, and th gnral fll
from his hors in a pool of blood. Nobody gav him a look or thought of
raising him.
“Gt onto th ic, ovr th ic! Go on! Turn! Don’t you har? Go
on!” innumrabl voics suddnly shoutd aftr th ball had struck
th gnral, th mn thmslvs not knowing what, or why, thy wr
shouting.
On of th hindmost guns that was going onto th dam turnd off onto th
ic. Crowds of soldirs from th dam bgan running onto th frozn pond.
Th ic gav way undr on of th formost soldirs, and on lg slippd
into th watr. H trid to right himslf but fll in up to his waist.
Th narst soldirs shrank back, th gun drivr stoppd his hors, but
from bhind still cam th shouts: “Onto th ic, why do you stop? Go
on! Go on!” And cris of horror wr hard in th crowd. Th soldirs
nar th gun wavd thir arms and bat th horss to mak thm turn and
mov on. Th horss movd off th bank. Th ic, that had hld undr
thos on foot, collapsd in a grat mass, and som forty mn who wr on
it dashd, som forward and som back, drowning on anothr.
Still th cannon balls continud rgularly to whistl and flop onto th
ic and into th watr and oftnst of all among th crowd that covrd
th dam, th pond, and th bank.
CHAPTR XIX
On th Pratzn Hights, whr h had falln with th flagstaff in his
hand, lay Princ Andrw Bolkónski blding profusly and unconsciously
uttring a gntl, pitous, and childlik moan.
Toward vning h casd moaning and bcam quit still. H did not know
how long his unconsciousnss lastd. Suddnly h again flt that h was
aliv and suffring from a burning, lacrating pain in his had.
“Whr is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw
today?” was his first thought. “And I did not know this suffring
ithr,” h thought. “Ys, I did not know anything, anything at all
till now. But whr am I?”
H listnd and hard th sound of approaching horss, and voics
spaking Frnch. H opnd his ys. Abov him again was th sam lofty
sky with clouds that had risn and wr floating still highr, and
btwn thm glamd blu infinity. H did not turn his had and did not
s thos who, judging by th sound of hoofs and voics, had riddn up
and stoppd nar him.
It was Napolon accompanid by two aids-d-camp. Bonapart riding
ovr th battlfild had givn final ordrs to strngthn th battris
firing at th Augsd Dam and was looking at th killd and woundd lft
on th fild.
“Fin mn!” rmarkd Napolon, looking at a dad Russian grnadir,
who, with his fac burid in th ground and a blacknd nap, lay on his
stomach with an alrady stiffnd arm flung wid.
“Th ammunition for th guns in position is xhaustd, Your
Majsty,” said an adjutant who had com from th battris that wr
firing at Augsd.
“Hav som brought from th rsrv,” said Napolon, and having gon
on a fw stps h stoppd bfor Princ Andrw, who lay on his back with
th flagstaff that had bn droppd bsid him. (Th flag had alrady
bn takn by th Frnch as a trophy.)
“That’s a fin dath!” said Napolon as h gazd at Bolkónski.
Princ Andrw undrstood that this was said of him and that it was
Napolon who said it. H hard th spakr addrssd as Sir. But h
hard th words as h might hav hard th buzzing of a fly. Not only
did thy not intrst him, but h took no notic of thm and at onc
forgot thm. His had was burning, h flt himslf blding to dath,
and h saw abov him th rmot, lofty, and vrlasting sky. H knw it
was Napolon—his hro—but at that momnt Napolon smd to him
such a small, insignificant cratur compard with what was passing now
btwn himslf and that lofty infinit sky with th clouds flying ovr
it. At that momnt it mant nothing to him who might b standing ovr
him, or what was said of him; h was only glad that popl wr standing
nar him and only wishd that thy would hlp him and bring him back to
lif, which smd to him so bautiful now that h had today larnd to
undrstand it so diffrntly. H collctd all his strngth, to stir and
uttr a sound. H fbly movd his lg and uttrd a wak, sickly groan
which arousd his own pity.
“Ah! H is aliv,” said Napolon. “Lift this young man up and
carry him to th drssing station.”
Having said this, Napolon rod on to mt Marshal Lanns, who, hat in
hand, rod up smiling to th mpror to congratulat him on th victory.
Princ Andrw rmmbrd nothing mor: h lost consciousnss from th
trribl pain of bing liftd onto th strtchr, th jolting whil
bing movd, and th probing of his wound at th drssing station.
H did not rgain consciousnss till lat in th day, whn with othr
woundd and capturd Russian officrs h was carrid to th hospital.
During this transfr h flt a littl strongr and was abl to look
about him and vn spak.
Th first words h hard on coming to his snss wr thos of a Frnch
convoy officr, who said rapidly: “W must halt hr: th mpror
will pass hr immdiatly; it will plas him to s ths gntlmn
prisonrs.”
“Thr ar so many prisonrs today, narly th whol Russian army,
that h is probably tird of thm,” said anothr officr.
“All th sam! Thy say this on is th commandr of all th mpror
Alxandr’s Guards,” said th first on, indicating a Russian
officr in th whit uniform of th Hors Guards.
Bolkónski rcognizd Princ Rpnín whom h had mt in Ptrsburg
socity. Bsid him stood a lad of nintn, also a woundd officr of
th Hors Guards.
Bonapart, having com up at a gallop, stoppd his hors.
“Which is th snior?” h askd, on sing th prisonrs.
Thy namd th colonl, Princ Rpnín.
“You ar th commandr of th mpror Alxandr’s rgimnt of Hors
Guards?” askd Napolon.
“I commandd a squadron,” rplid Rpnín.
“Your rgimnt fulfilld its duty honorably,” said Napolon.
“Th prais of a grat commandr is a soldir’s highst rward,”
said Rpnín.
“I bstow it with plasur,” said Napolon. “And who is that young
man bsid you?”
Princ Rpnín namd Liutnant Sukhtln.
Aftr looking at him Napolon smild.
“H’s vry young to com to mddl with us.”
“Youth is no hindranc to courag,” muttrd Sukhtln in a failing
voic.
“A splndid rply!” said Napolon. “Young man, you will go far!”
Princ Andrw, who had also bn brought forward bfor th mpror’s
ys to complt th show of prisonrs, could not fail to attract his
attntion. Napolon apparntly rmmbrd sing him on th battlfild
and, addrssing him, again usd th pitht “young man” that was
connctd in his mmory with Princ Andrw.
“Wll, and you, young man,” said h. “How do you fl, mon
brav?”
Though fiv minuts bfor, Princ Andrw had bn abl to say a fw
words to th soldirs who wr carrying him, now with his ys fixd
straight on Napolon, h was silnt.... So insignificant at that momnt
smd to him all th intrsts that ngrossd Napolon, so man did his
hro himslf with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appar,
compard to th lofty, quitabl, and kindly sky which h had sn and
undrstood, that h could not answr him.
vrything smd so futil and insignificant in comparison with th
strn and solmn train of thought that waknss from loss of blood,
suffring, and th narnss of dath arousd in him. Looking into
Napolon’s ys Princ Andrw thought of th insignificanc of
gratnss, th unimportanc of lif which no on could undrstand, and
th still gratr unimportanc of dath, th maning of which no on
aliv could undrstand or xplain.
Th mpror without waiting for an answr turnd away and said to on of
th officrs as h wnt: “Hav ths gntlmn attndd to and takn
to my bivouac; lt my doctor, Larry, xamin thir wounds. Au rvoir,
Princ Rpnín!” and h spurrd his hors and gallopd away.
His fac shon with slf-satisfaction and plasur.
Th soldirs who had carrid Princ Andrw had noticd and takn th
littl gold icon Princss Mary had hung round hr brothr’s nck, but
sing th favor th mpror showd th prisonrs, thy now hastnd to
rturn th holy imag.
Princ Andrw did not s how and by whom it was rplacd, but th
littl icon with its thin gold chain suddnly appard upon his chst
outsid his uniform.
“It would b good,” thought Princ Andrw, glancing at th icon his
sistr had hung round his nck with such motion and rvrnc, “it
would b good if vrything wr as clar and simpl as it sms to
Mary. How good it would b to know whr to sk for hlp in this lif,
and what to xpct aftr it byond th grav! How happy and calm I
should b if I could now say: ‘Lord, hav mrcy on m!’... But to
whom should I say that? ithr to a Powr indfinabl, incomprhnsibl,
which I not only cannot addrss but which I cannot vn xprss in
words—th Grat All or Nothing-” said h to himslf, “or to
that God who has bn swn into this amult by Mary! Thr is nothing
crtain, nothing at all xcpt th unimportanc of vrything I
undrstand, and th gratnss of somthing incomprhnsibl but
all-important.”
Th strtchrs movd on. At vry jolt h again flt unndurabl pain;
his fvrishnss incrasd and h grw dlirious. Visions of his fathr,
wif, sistr, and futur son, and th tndrnss h had flt th night
bfor th battl, th figur of th insignificant littl Napolon, and
abov all this th lofty sky, formd th chif subjcts of his dlirious
fancis.
Th quit hom lif and pacful happinss of Bald Hills prsntd
itslf to him. H was alrady njoying that happinss whn that
littl Napolon had suddnly appard with his unsympathizing look of
shortsightd dlight at th misry of othrs, and doubts and tormnts
had followd, and only th havns promisd pac. Toward morning
all ths drams mltd and mrgd into th chaos and darknss of
unconciousnss and oblivion which in th opinion of Napolon’s doctor,
Larry, was much mor likly to nd in dath than in convalscnc.
“H is a nrvous, bilious subjct,” said Larry, “and will not
rcovr.”
And Princ Andrw, with othrs fatally woundd, was lft to th car of
th inhabitants of th district.
BOOK FOUR: 1806
CHAPTR I
arly in th yar 1806 Nicholas Rostóv rturnd hom on lav. Dnísov
was going hom to Vorónzh and Rostóv prsuadd him to travl with him
as far as Moscow and to stay with him thr. Mting a comrad at
th last post station but on bfor Moscow, Dnísov had drunk thr
bottls of win with him and, dspit th jolting ruts across th
snow-covrd road, did not onc wak up on th way to Moscow, but lay
at th bottom of th sligh bsid Rostóv, who grw mor and mor
impatint th narr thy got to Moscow.
“How much longr? How much longr? Oh, ths insuffrabl strts,
shops, bakrs’ signboards, strt lamps, and slighs!” thought
Rostóv, whn thir lav prmits had bn passd at th town gat and
thy had ntrd Moscow.
“Dnísov! W’r hr! H’s aslp,” h addd, laning forward
with his whol body as if in that position h hopd to hastn th spd
of th sligh.
Dnísov gav no answr.
“Thr’s th cornr at th crossroads, whr th cabman, Zakhár,
has his stand, and thr’s Zakhár himslf and still th sam hors!
And hr’s th littl shop whr w usd to buy gingrbrad! Can’t
you hurry up? Now thn!”
“Which hous is it?” askd th drivr.
“Why, that on, right at th nd, th big on. Don’t you s?
That’s our hous,” said Rostóv. “Of cours, it’s our hous!
Dnísov, Dnísov! W’r almost thr!”
Dnísov raisd his had, coughd, and mad no answr.
“Dmítri,” said Rostóv to his valt on th box, “thos lights ar
in our hous, arn’t thy?”
“Ys, sir, and thr’s a light in your fathr’s study.”
“Thn thy’v not gon to bd yt? What do you think? Mind now,
don’t forgt to put out my nw coat,” addd Rostóv, fingring his
nw mustach. “Now thn, gt on,” h shoutd to th drivr. “Do
wak up, Váska!” h wnt on, turning to Dnísov, whos had
was again nodding. “Com, gt on! You shall hav thr rubls for
vodka—gt on!” Rostóv shoutd, whn th sligh was only thr
houss from his door. It smd to him th horss wr not moving at
all. At last th sligh bor to th right, drw up at an ntranc, and
Rostóv saw ovrhad th old familiar cornic with a bit of plastr
brokn off, th porch, and th post by th sid of th pavmnt. H
sprang out bfor th sligh stoppd, and ran into th hall. Th hous
stood cold and silnt, as if quit rgardlss of who had com to it.
Thr was no on in th hall. “Oh God! Is vryon all right?”
h thought, stopping for a momnt with a sinking hart, and thn
immdiatly starting to run along th hall and up th warpd stps of
th familiar staircas. Th wll-known old door handl, which always
angrd th countss whn it was not proprly cland, turnd as loosly
as vr. A solitary tallow candl burnd in th antroom.
Old Michal was aslp on th chst. Prokófy, th footman, who was
so strong that h could lift th back of th carriag from bhind, sat
plaiting slipprs out of cloth slvdgs. H lookd up at th opning
door and his xprssion of slpy indiffrnc suddnly changd to on
of dlightd amazmnt.
“Gracious havns! Th young count!” h crid, rcognizing his
young mastr. “Can it b? My trasur!” and Prokófy, trmbling with
xcitmnt, rushd toward th drawing room door, probably in ordr to
announc him, but, changing his mind, cam back and stoopd to kiss th
young man’s shouldr.
“All wll?” askd Rostóv, drawing away his arm.
“Ys, God b thankd! Ys! Thy’v just finishd suppr. Lt m hav
a look at you, your xcllncy.”
“Is vrything quit all right?”
“Th Lord b thankd, ys!”
Rostóv, who had compltly forgottn Dnísov, not wishing anyon to
forstall him, thrw off his fur coat and ran on tipto through th
larg dark ballroom. All was th sam: thr wr th sam old card
tabls and th sam chandlir with a covr ovr it; but somon had
alrady sn th young mastr, and, bfor h had rachd th drawing
room, somthing flw out from a sid door lik a tornado and bgan
hugging and kissing him. Anothr and yt anothr cratur of th sam
kind sprang from a scond door and a third; mor hugging, mor kissing,
mor outcris, and tars of joy. H could not distinguish which was
Papa, which Natásha, and which Ptya. vryon shoutd, talkd, and
kissd him at th sam tim. Only his mothr was not thr, h noticd
that.
“And I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...”
“Hr h is... our own... Kólya, * dar fllow... How h has
changd!... Whr ar th candls?... Ta!...”
    * Nicholas.
“And m, kiss m!”
“Darst... and m!”
Sónya, Natásha, Ptya, Anna Mikháylovna, Vra, and th old count
wr all hugging him, and th srfs, mn and maids, flockd into th
room, xclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.
Ptya, clinging to his lgs, kpt shouting, “And m too!”
Natásha, aftr sh had pulld him down toward hr and covrd his fac
with kisss, holding him tight by th skirt of his coat, sprang away and
prancd up and down in on plac lik a goat and shrikd pircingly.
All around wr loving ys glistning with tars of joy, and all around
wr lips sking a kiss.
Sónya too, all rosy rd, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss,
lookd agrly toward his ys, waiting for th look for which sh
longd. Sónya now was sixtn and sh was vry prtty, spcially at
this momnt of happy, rapturous xcitmnt. Sh gazd at him, not taking
hr ys off him, and smiling and holding hr brath. H gav hr a
gratful look, but was still xpctant and looking for somon. Th old
countss had not yt com. But now stps wr hard at th door, stps
so rapid that thy could hardly b his mothr’s.
Yt it was sh, drssd in a nw gown which h did not know, mad sinc
h had lft. All th othrs lt him go, and h ran to hr. Whn thy
mt, sh fll on his brast, sobbing. Sh could not lift hr fac, but
only prssd it to th cold braiding of his hussar’s jackt. Dnísov,
who had com into th room unnoticd by anyon, stood thr and wipd
his ys at th sight.
“Vasíli Dnísov, your son’s frind,” h said, introducing
himslf to th count, who was looking inquiringly at him.
“You ar most wlcom! I know, I know,” said th count, kissing and
mbracing Dnísov. “Nicholas wrot us... Natásha, Vra, look! Hr
is Dnísov!”
Th sam happy, rapturous facs turnd to th shaggy figur of Dnísov.
“Darling Dnísov!” scramd Natásha, bsid hrslf with raptur,
springing to him, putting hr arms round him, and kissing him. This
scapad mad vrybody fl confusd. Dnísov blushd too, but smild
and, taking Natásha’s hand, kissd it.
Dnísov was shown to th room prpard for him, and th Rostóvs all
gathrd round Nicholas in th sitting room.
Th old countss, not ltting go of his hand and kissing it vry
momnt, sat bsid him: th rst, crowding round him, watchd vry
movmnt, word, or look of his, nvr taking thir blissfully adoring
ys off him. His brothr and sistrs struggld for th placs narst
to him and disputd with on anothr who should bring him his ta,
handkrchif, and pip.
Rostóv was vry happy in th lov thy showd him; but th first
momnt of mting had bn so batific that his prsnt joy smd
insufficint, and h kpt xpcting somthing mor, mor and yt mor.
Nxt morning, aftr th fatigus of thir journy, th travlrs slpt
till tn o’clock.
In th room nxt thir bdroom thr was a confusion of sabrs,
satchls, sabrtachs, opn portmantaus, and dirty boots. Two frshly
cland pairs with spurs had just bn placd by th wall. Th srvants
wr bringing in jugs and basins, hot watr for shaving, and thir
wll-brushd cloths. Thr was a masculin odor and a smll of tobacco.
“Hallo, Gwíska—my pip!” cam Vasíli Dnísov’s husky voic.
“Wostóv, gt up!”
Rostóv, rubbing his ys that smd glud togthr, raisd his
dishvld had from th hot pillow.
“Why, is it lat?”
“Lat! It’s narly tn o’clock,” answrd Natásha’s voic.
A rustl of starchd ptticoats and th whispring and laughtr of
girls’ voics cam from th adjoining room. Th door was opnd a
crack and thr was a glimps of somthing blu, of ribbons, black hair,
and mrry facs. It was Natásha, Sónya, and Ptya, who had com to
s whthr thy wr gtting up.
“Nicholas! Gt up!” Natásha’s voic was again hard at th door.
“Dirctly!”
Manwhil, Ptya, having found and sizd th sabrs in th outr room,
with th dlight boys fl at th sight of a military ldr brothr, and
forgtting that it was unbcoming for th girls to s mn undrssd,
opnd th bdroom door.
“Is this your sabr?” h shoutd.
Th girls sprang asid. Dnísov hid his hairy lgs undr th blankt,
looking with a scard fac at his comrad for hlp. Th door, having lt
Ptya in, closd again. A sound of laughtr cam from bhind it.
“Nicholas! Com out in your drssing gown!” said Natásha’s voic.
“Is this your sabr?” askd Ptya. “Or is it yours?” h said,
addrssing th black-mustachd Dnísov with srvil dfrnc.
Rostóv hurridly put somthing on his ft, drw on his drssing gown,
and wnt out. Natásha had put on on spurrd boot and was just gtting
hr foot into th othr. Sónya, whn h cam in, was twirling round and
was about to xpand hr drsss into a balloon and sit down. Thy wr
drssd alik, in nw pal-blu frocks, and wr both frsh, rosy, and
bright. Sónya ran away, but Natásha, taking hr brothr’s arm, ld
him into th sitting room, whr thy bgan talking. Thy hardly gav
on anothr tim to ask qustions and giv rplis concrning a thousand
littl mattrs which could not intrst anyon but thmslvs. Natásha
laughd at vry word h said or that sh said hrslf, not bcaus what
thy wr saying was amusing, but bcaus sh flt happy and was unabl
to control hr joy which xprssd itslf by laughtr.
“Oh, how nic, how splndid!” sh said to vrything.
Rostóv flt that, undr th influnc of th warm rays of lov, that
childlik smil which had not onc appard on his fac sinc h lft
hom now for th first tim aftr ightn months again brightnd his
soul and his fac.
“No, but listn,” sh said, “now you ar quit a man, arn’t
you? I’m awfully glad you’r my brothr.” Sh touchd his
mustach. “I want to know what you mn ar lik. Ar you th sam as
w? No?”
“Why did Sónya run away?” askd Rostóv.
“Ah, ys! That’s a whol long story! How ar you going to spak to
hr—thou or you?”
“As may happn,” said Rostóv.
“No, call hr you, plas! I’ll tll you all about it som othr
tim. No, I’ll tll you now. You know Sónya’s my darst frind.
Such a frind that I burnd my arm for hr sak. Look hr!”
Sh pulld up hr muslin slv and showd him a rd scar on hr long,
slndr, dlicat arm, high abov th lbow on that part that is covrd
vn by a ball drss.
“I burnd this to prov my lov for hr. I just hatd a rulr in th
fir and prssd it thr!”
Sitting on th sofa with th littl cushions on its arms, in what usd
to b his old schoolroom, and looking into Natásha’s wildly bright
ys, Rostóv r-ntrd that world of hom and childhood which had no
maning for anyon ls, but gav him som of th bst joys of his lif;
and th burning of an arm with a rulr as a proof of lov did not sm
to him snslss, h undrstood and was not surprisd at it.
“Wll, and is that all?” h askd.
“W ar such frinds, such frinds! All that rulr businss was just
nonsns, but w ar frinds forvr. Sh, if sh lovs anyon, dos it
for lif, but I don’t undrstand that, I forgt quickly.”
“Wll, what thn?”
“Wll, sh lovs m and you lik that.”
Natásha suddnly flushd.
“Why, you rmmbr bfor you wnt away?... Wll, sh says you ar to
forgt all that.... Sh says: ‘I shall lov him always, but lt him b
fr.’ Isn’t that lovly and nobl! Ys, vry nobl? Isn’t it?”
askd Natásha, so sriously and xcitdly that it was vidnt that what
sh was now saying sh had talkd of bfor, with tars.
Rostóv bcam thoughtful.
“I nvr go back on my word,” h said. “Bsids, Sónya is so
charming that only a fool would rnounc such happinss.”
“No, no!” crid Natásha, “sh and I hav alrady talkd it ovr.
W knw you’d say so. But it won’t do, bcaus you s, if you say
that—if you considr yourslf bound by your promis—it will sm as
if sh had not mant it sriously. It maks it as if you wr marrying
hr bcaus you must, and that wouldn’t do at all.”
Rostóv saw that it had bn wll considrd by thm. Sónya had alrady
struck him by hr bauty on th prcding day. Today, whn h had caught
a glimps of hr, sh smd still mor lovly. Sh was a charming girl
of sixtn, vidntly passionatly in lov with him (h did not doubt
that for an instant). Why should h not lov hr now, and vn marry
hr, Rostóv thought, but just now thr wr so many othr plasurs
and intrsts bfor him! “Ys, thy hav takn a wis dcision,” h
thought, “I must rmain fr.”
“Wll thn, that’s xcllnt,” said h. “W’ll talk it ovr
latr on. Oh, how glad I am to hav you!”
“Wll, and ar you still tru to Borís?” h continud.
“Oh, what nonsns!” crid Natásha, laughing. “I don’t think
about him or anyon ls, and I don’t want anything of th kind.”
“Dar m! Thn what ar you up to now?”
“Now?” rpatd Natásha, and a happy smil lit up hr fac. “Hav
you sn Duport?”
“No.”
“Not sn Duport—th famous dancr? Wll thn, you won’t
undrstand. That’s what I’m up to.”
Curving hr arms, Natásha hld out hr skirts as dancrs do, ran back
a fw stps, turnd, cut a capr, brought hr littl ft sharply
togthr, and mad som stps on th vry tips of hr tos.
“S, I’m standing! S!” sh said, but could not maintain hrslf
on hr tos any longr. “So that’s what I’m up to! I’ll nvr
marry anyon, but will b a dancr. Only don’t tll anyon.”
Rostóv laughd so loud and mrrily that Dnísov, in his bdroom, flt
nvious and Natásha could not hlp joining in.
“No, but don’t you think it’s nic?” sh kpt rpating.
“Nic! And so you no longr wish to marry Borís?”
Natásha flard up. “I don’t want to marry anyon. And I’ll tll
him so whn I s him!”
“Dar m!” said Rostóv.
“But that’s all rubbish,” Natásha chattrd on. “And is
Dnísov nic?” sh askd.
“Ys, indd!”
“Oh, wll thn, good-by: go and drss. Is h vry trribl,
Dnísov?”
“Why trribl?” askd Nicholas. “No, Váska is a splndid
fllow.”
“You call him Váska? That’s funny! And is h vry nic?”
“Vry.”
“Wll thn, b quick. W’ll all hav brakfast togthr.”
And Natásha ros and wnt out of th room on tipto, lik a ballt
dancr, but smiling as only happy girls of fiftn can smil. Whn
Rostóv mt Sónya in th drawing room, h rddnd. H did not know
how to bhav with hr. Th vning bfor, in th first happy momnt of
mting, thy had kissd ach othr, but today thy flt it could not
b don; h flt that vrybody, including his mothr and sistrs, was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to s how h would bhav
with hr. H kissd hr hand and addrssd hr not as thou but as
you—Sónya. But thir ys mt and said thou, and xchangd tndr
kisss. Hr looks askd him to forgiv hr for having dard, by
Natásha’s intrmdiacy, to rmind him of his promis, and thn
thankd him for his lov. His looks thankd hr for offring him his
frdom and told hr that on way or anothr h would nvr cas to
lov hr, for that would b impossibl.
“How strang it is,” said Vra, slcting a momnt whn all wr
silnt, “that Sónya and Nicholas now say you to on anothr and mt
lik strangrs.”
Vra’s rmark was corrct, as hr rmarks always wr, but, lik
most of hr obsrvations, it mad vryon fl uncomfortabl, not
only Sónya, Nicholas, and Natásha, but vn th old countss,
who—drading this lov affair which might hindr Nicholas from making
a brilliant match—blushd lik a girl.
Dnísov, to Rostóv’s surpris, appard in th drawing room with
pomadd hair, prfumd, and in a nw uniform, looking just as smart as
h mad himslf whn going into battl, and h was mor amiabl to th
ladis and gntlmn than Rostóv had vr xpctd to s him.
CHAPTR II
On his rturn to Moscow from th army, Nicholas Rostóv was wlcomd
by his hom circl as th bst of sons, a hro, and thir darling
Nikólnka; by his rlations as a charming, attractiv, and polit young
man; by his acquaintancs as a handsom liutnant of hussars, a good
dancr, and on of th bst matchs in th city.
Th Rostóvs knw vrybody in Moscow. Th old count had mony nough
that yar, as all his stats had bn rmortgagd, and so Nicholas,
acquiring a trottr of his own, vry stylish riding brchs of th
latst cut, such as no on ls yt had in Moscow, and boots of th
latst fashion, with xtrmly pointd tos and small silvr spurs,
passd his tim vry gaily. Aftr a short priod of adapting himslf
to th old conditions of lif, Nicholas found it vry plasant to b
at hom again. H flt that h had grown up and maturd vry much. His
dspair at failing in a Scriptur xamination, his borrowing mony from
Gavríl to pay a sligh drivr, his kissing Sónya on th sly—h now
rcalld all this as childishnss h had lft immasurably bhind.
Now h was a liutnant of hussars, in a jackt lacd with silvr, and
waring th Cross of St. Gorg, awardd to soldirs for bravry in
action, and in th company of wll-known, ldrly, and rspctd racing
mn was training a trottr of his own for a rac. H knw a lady on on
of th boulvards whom h visitd of an vning. H ld th mazurka
at th Arkhárovs’ ball, talkd about th war with Fild Marshal
Kámnski, visitd th nglish Club, and was on intimat trms with a
colonl of forty to whom Dnísov had introducd him.
His passion for th mpror had coold somwhat in Moscow. But still, as
h did not s him and had no opportunity of sing him, h oftn spok
about him and about his lov for him, ltting it b undrstood that h
had not told all and that thr was somthing in his flings for th
mpror not vryon could undrstand, and with his whol soul h shard
th adoration thn common in Moscow for th mpror, who was spokn of
as th “angl incarnat.”
During Rostóv’s short stay in Moscow, bfor rjoining th army, h
did not draw closr to Sónya, but rathr driftd away from hr. Sh was
vry prtty and swt, and vidntly dply in lov with him, but h was
at th priod of youth whn thr sms so much to do that thr is no
tim for that sort of thing and a young man fars to bind himslf and
prizs his frdom which h nds for so many othr things. Whn h
thought of Sónya, during this stay in Moscow, h said to himslf,
“Ah, thr will b, and thr ar, many mor such girls somwhr whom
I do not yt know. Thr will b tim nough to think about lov whn I
want to, but now I hav no tim.” Bsids, it smd to him that th
socity of womn was rathr drogatory to his manhood. H wnt to balls
and into ladis’ socity with an affctation of doing so against his
will. Th racs, th nglish Club, sprs with Dnísov, and visits to
a crtain hous—that was anothr mattr and quit th thing for a
dashing young hussar!
At th bginning of March, old Count Ilyá Rostóv was vry busy
arranging a dinnr in honor of Princ Bagratión at th nglish Club.
Th count walkd up and down th hall in his drssing gown, giving
ordrs to th club stward and to th famous Foktíst, th club’s
had cook, about asparagus, frsh cucumbrs, strawbrris, val, and
fish for this dinnr. Th count had bn a mmbr and on th committ
of th club from th day it was foundd. To him th club ntrustd th
arrangmnt of th fstival in honor of Bagratión, for fw mn knw
so wll how to arrang a fast on an opn-handd, hospitabl scal,
and still fwr mn would b so wll abl and willing to mak up out of
thir own rsourcs what might b ndd for th succss of th ft.
Th club cook and th stward listnd to th count’s ordrs with
plasd facs, for thy knw that undr no othr managmnt could thy
so asily xtract a good profit for thmslvs from a dinnr costing
svral thousand rubls.
“Wll thn, mind and hav cocks’ comb in th turtl soup, you
know!”
“Shall w hav thr cold dishs thn?” askd th cook.
Th count considrd.
“W can’t hav lss—ys, thr... th mayonnais, that’s on,”
said h, bnding down a fingr.
“Thn am I to ordr thos larg strlts?” askd th stward.
“Ys, it can’t b hlpd if thy won’t tak lss. Ah, dar m! I
was forgtting. W must hav anothr ntr. Ah, goodnss gracious!”
h clutchd at his had. “Who is going to gt m th flowrs? Dmítri!
h, Dmítri! Gallop off to our Moscow stat,” h said to th factotum
who appard at his call. “Hurry off and tll Maksím, th gardnr,
to st th srfs to work. Say that vrything out of th hothouss must
b brought hr wll wrappd up in flt. I must hav two hundrd pots
hr on Friday.”
Having givn svral mor ordrs, h was about to go to his “littl
countss” to hav a rst, but rmmbring somthing ls of
importanc, h rturnd again, calld back th cook and th club
stward, and again bgan giving ordrs. A light footstp and th
clinking of spurs wr hard at th door, and th young count, handsom,
rosy, with a dark littl mustach, vidntly rstd and mad slkr by
his asy lif in Moscow, ntrd th room.
“Ah, my boy, my had’s in a whirl!” said th old man with a smil,
as if h flt a littl confusd bfor his son. “Now, if you would
only hlp a bit! I must hav singrs too. I shall hav my own orchstra,
but shouldn’t w gt th gypsy singrs as wll? You military mn lik
that sort of thing.”
“Rally, Papa, I bliv Princ Bagratión worrid himslf lss bfor
th battl of Schön Grabrn than you do now,” said his son with a
smil.
Th old count prtndd to b angry.
“Ys, you talk, but try it yourslf!”
And th count turnd to th cook, who, with a shrwd and rspctful
xprssion, lookd obsrvantly and sympathtically at th fathr and
son.
“What hav th young popl com to nowadays, h, Foktíst?” said
h. “Laughing at us old fllows!”
“That’s so, your xcllncy, all thy hav to do is to at a good
dinnr, but providing it and srving it all up, that’s not thir
businss!”
“That’s it, that’s it!” xclaimd th count, and gaily sizing
his son by both hands, h crid, “Now I’v got you, so tak th
sligh and pair at onc, and go to Bzúkhov’s, and tll him ‘Count
Ilyá has snt you to ask for strawbrris and frsh pinappls.’ W
can’t gt thm from anyon ls. H’s not thr himslf, so you’ll
hav to go in and ask th princsss; and from thr go on to th
Rasgulyáy—th coachman Ipátka knows—and look up th gypsy
Ilyúshka, th on who dancd at Count Orlóv’s, you rmmbr, in a
whit Cossack coat, and bring him along to m.”
“And am I to bring th gypsy girls along with him?” askd Nicholas,
laughing. “Dar, dar!...”
At that momnt, with noislss footstps and with th businsslik,
proccupid, yt mkly Christian look which nvr lft hr fac, Anna
Mikháylovna ntrd th hall. Though sh cam upon th count in his
drssing gown vry day, h invariably bcam confusd and bggd hr to
xcus his costum.
“No mattr at all, my dar count,” sh said, mkly closing hr
ys. “But I’ll go to Bzúkhov’s myslf. Pirr has arrivd, and
now w shall gt anything w want from his hothouss. I hav to s him
in any cas. H has forwardd m a lttr from Borís. Thank God, Borís
is now on th staff.”
Th count was dlightd at Anna Mikháylovna’s taking upon hrslf on
of his commissions and ordrd th small closd carriag for hr.
“Tll Bzúkhov to com. I’ll put his nam down. Is his wif with
him?” h askd.
Anna Mikháylovna turnd up hr ys, and profound sadnss was dpictd
on hr fac.
“Ah, my dar frind, h is vry unfortunat,” sh said. “If what
w har is tru, it is dradful. How littl w dramd of such a thing
whn w wr rjoicing at his happinss! And such a lofty anglic soul
as young Bzúkhov! Ys, I pity him from my hart, and shall try to giv
him what consolation I can.”
“Wh-what is th mattr?” askd both th young and old Rostóv.
Anna Mikháylovna sighd dply.
“Dólokhov, Mary Ivánovna’s son,” sh said in a mystrious
whispr, “has compromisd hr compltly, thy say. Pirr took him
up, invitd him to his hous in Ptrsburg, and now... sh has com hr
and that dardvil aftr hr!” said Anna Mikháylovna, wishing to show
hr sympathy for Pirr, but by involuntary intonations and a half smil
btraying hr sympathy for th “dardvil,” as sh calld Dólokhov.
“Thy say Pirr is quit brokn by his misfortun.”
“Dar, dar! But still tll him to com to th club—it will all blow
ovr. It will b a trmndous banqut.”
Nxt day, th third of March, soon aftr on o’clock, two hundrd and
fifty mmbrs of th nglish Club and fifty gusts wr awaiting th
gust of honor and hro of th Austrian campaign, Princ Bagratión, to
dinnr.
On th first arrival of th nws of th battl of Austrlitz, Moscow had
bn bwildrd. At that tim, th Russians wr so usd to victoris
that on rciving nws of th dfat som would simply not bliv it,
whil othrs sought som xtraordinary xplanation of so strang an
vnt. In th nglish Club, whr all who wr distinguishd, important,
and wll informd forgathrd whn th nws bgan to arriv in
Dcmbr, nothing was said about th war and th last battl, as
though all wr in a conspiracy of silnc. Th mn who st th ton
in convrsation—Count Rostopchín, Princ Yúri Dolgorúkov, Valúv,
Count Markóv, and Princ Vyázmski—did not show thmslvs at th
club, but mt in privat houss in intimat circls, and th
Moscovits who took thir opinions from othrs—Ilyá Rostóv among
thm—rmaind for a whil without any dfinit opinion on th subjct
of th war and without ladrs. Th Moscovits flt that somthing was
wrong and that to discuss th bad nws was difficult, and so it was bst
to b silnt. But aftr a whil, just as a jury coms out of its room,
th bigwigs who guidd th club’s opinion rappard, and vrybody
bgan spaking clarly and dfinitly. Rasons wr found for th
incrdibl, unhard-of, and impossibl vnt of a Russian dfat,
vrything bcam clar, and in all cornrs of Moscow th sam things
bgan to b said. Ths rasons wr th trachry of th Austrians, a
dfctiv commissariat, th trachry of th Pol Przbyszwski and of
th Frnchman Langron, Kutúzov’s incapacity, and (it was whisprd)
th youth and inxprinc of th sovrign, who had trustd worthlss
and insignificant popl. But th army, th Russian army, vryon
dclard, was xtraordinary and had achivd miracls of valor. Th
soldirs, officrs, and gnrals wr hros. But th hro of hros was
Princ Bagratión, distinguishd by his Schön Grabrn affair and by
th rtrat from Austrlitz, whr h alon had withdrawn his column
unbrokn and had all day batn back an nmy forc twic as numrous
as his own. What also conducd to Bagratión’s bing slctd as
Moscow’s hro was th fact that h had no connctions in th city
and was a strangr thr. In his prson, honor was shown to a simpl
fighting Russian soldir without connctions and intrigus, and to on
who was associatd by mmoris of th Italian campaign with th nam of
Suvórov. Morovr, paying such honor to Bagratión was th bst way of
xprssing disapproval and dislik of Kutúzov.
“Had thr bn no Bagratión, it would hav bn ncssary to
invnt him,” said th wit Shinshín, parodying th words of Voltair.
Kutúzov no on spok of, xcpt som who abusd him in whisprs,
calling him a court wathrcock and an old satyr.
All Moscow rpatd Princ Dolgorúkov’s saying: “If you go on
modling and modling you must gt smard with clay,” suggsting
consolation for our dfat by th mmory of formr victoris; and th
words of Rostopchín, that Frnch soldirs hav to b incitd to battl
by highfalutin words, and Grmans by logical argumnts to show thm
that it is mor dangrous to run away than to advanc, but that Russian
soldirs only nd to b rstraind and hld back! On all sids, nw and
frsh ancdots wr hard of individual xampls of hroism shown by
our officrs and mn at Austrlitz. On had savd a standard, anothr
had killd fiv Frnchmn, a third had loadd fiv cannon singlhandd.
Brg was mntiond, by thos who did not know him, as having, whn
woundd in th right hand, takn his sword in th lft, and gon
forward. Of Bolkónski, nothing was said, and only thos who knw him
intimatly rgrttd that h had did so young, laving a prgnant wif
with his ccntric fathr.
CHAPTR III
On that third of March, all th rooms in th nglish Club wr filld
with a hum of convrsation, lik th hum of bs swarming in springtim.
Th mmbrs and gusts of th club wandrd hithr and thithr, sat,
stood, mt, and sparatd, som in uniform and som in vning drss,
and a fw hr and thr with powdrd hair and in Russian kaftáns.
Powdrd footmn, in livry with buckld shos and smart stockings,
stood at vry door anxiously noting visitors’ vry movmnt in ordr
to offr thir srvics. Most of thos prsnt wr ldrly, rspctd
mn with broad, slf-confidnt facs, fat fingrs, and rsolut gsturs
and voics. This class of gusts and mmbrs sat in crtain habitual
placs and mt in crtain habitual groups. A minority of thos prsnt
wr casual gusts—chifly young mn, among whom wr Dnísov,
Rostóv, and Dólokhov—who was now again an officr in th Smënov
rgimnt. Th facs of ths young popl, spcially thos who wr
military mn, bor that xprssion of condscnding rspct for thir
ldrs which sms to say to th oldr gnration, “W ar prpard to
rspct and honor you, but all th sam rmmbr that th futur blongs
to us.”
Nsvítski was thr as an old mmbr of th club. Pirr, who at his
wif’s command had lt his hair grow and abandond his spctacls,
wnt about th rooms fashionably drssd but looking sad and dull. Hr,
as lswhr, h was surroundd by an atmosphr of subsrvinc to
his walth, and bing in th habit of lording it ovr ths popl, h
tratd thm with absnt-mindd contmpt.
By his ag h should hav blongd to th youngr mn, but by his walth
and connctions h blongd to th groups of old and honord gusts, and
so h wnt from on group to anothr. Som of th most important old mn
wr th cntr of groups which vn strangrs approachd rspctfully
to har th voics of wll-known mn. Th largst circls formd round
Count Rostopchín, Valúv, and Narýshkin. Rostopchín was dscribing
how th Russians had bn ovrwhlmd by flying Austrians and had had to
forc thir way through thm with bayonts.
Valúv was confidntially tlling that Uvárov had bn snt from
Ptrsburg to ascrtain what Moscow was thinking about Austrlitz.
In th third circl, Narýshkin was spaking of th mting of th
Austrian Council of War at which Suvórov crowd lik a cock in rply to
th nonsns talkd by th Austrian gnrals. Shinshín, standing clos
by, trid to mak a jok, saying that Kutúzov had vidntly faild to
larn from Suvórov vn so simpl a thing as th art of crowing lik a
cock, but th ldr mmbrs glancd svrly at th wit, making him
fl that in that plac and on that day, it was impropr to spak so of
Kutúzov.
Count Ilyá Rostóv, hurrid and proccupid, wnt about in his soft
boots btwn th dining and drawing rooms, hastily grting th
important and unimportant, all of whom h knw, as if thy wr all
quals, whil his ys occasionally sought out his fin wll-st-up
young son, rsting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rostóv
stood at a window with Dólokhov, whos acquaintanc h had latly
mad and highly valud. Th old count cam up to thm and prssd
Dólokhov’s hand.
“Plas com and visit us... you know my brav boy... bn togthr
out thr... both playing th hro... Ah, Vasíli Ignátovich...
How d’y do, old fllow?” h said, turning to an old man who was
passing, but bfor h had finishd his grting thr was a gnral
stir, and a footman who had run in announcd, with a frightnd fac:
“H’s arrivd!”
Blls rang, th stwards rushd forward, and—lik ry shakn togthr
in a shovl—th gusts who had bn scattrd about in diffrnt rooms
cam togthr and crowdd in th larg drawing room by th door of th
ballroom.
Bagratión appard in th doorway of th antroom without hat or sword,
which, in accord with th club custom, h had givn up to th hall
portr. H had no lambskin cap on his had, nor had h a loadd whip
ovr his shouldr, as whn Rostóv had sn him on th v of th battl
of Austrlitz, but wor a tight nw uniform with Russian and forign
Ordrs, and th Star of St. Gorg on his lft brast. vidntly just
bfor coming to th dinnr h had had his hair and whiskrs trimmd,
which changd his apparanc for th wors. Thr was somthing naïvly
fstiv in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and viril
faturs, gav him a rathr comical xprssion. Bklshëv and Thodor
Uvárov, who had arrivd with him, pausd at th doorway to allow him,
as th gust of honor, to ntr first. Bagratión was mbarrassd, not
wishing to avail himslf of thir courtsy, and this causd som dlay
at th doors, but aftr all h did at last ntr first. H walkd shyly
and awkwardly ovr th parqut floor of th rcption room, not knowing
what to do with his hands; h was mor accustomd to walk ovr a plowd
fild undr fir, as h had don at th had of th Kursk rgimnt at
Schön Grabrn—and h would hav found that asir. Th committmn
mt him at th first door and, xprssing thir dlight at sing such a
highly honord gust, took possssion of him as it wr, without waiting
for his rply, surroundd him, and ld him to th drawing room. It was
at first impossibl to ntr th drawing room door for th crowd of
mmbrs and gusts jostling on anothr and trying to gt a good look
at Bagratión ovr ach othr’s shouldrs, as if h wr som rar
animal. Count Ilyá Rostóv, laughing and rpating th words, “Mak
way, dar boy! Mak way, mak way!” pushd through th crowd mor
nrgtically than anyon, ld th gusts into th drawing room, and
satd thm on th cntr sofa. Th bigwigs, th most rspctd mmbrs
of th club, bst th nw arrivals. Count Ilyá, again thrusting his
way through th crowd, wnt out of th drawing room and rappard a
minut latr with anothr committman, carrying a larg silvr salvr
which h prsntd to Princ Bagratión. On th salvr lay som vrss
composd and printd in th hro’s honor. Bagratión, on sing th
salvr, glancd around in dismay, as though sking hlp. But all ys
dmandd that h should submit. Fling himslf in thir powr, h
rsolutly took th salvr with both hands and lookd strnly and
rproachfully at th count who had prsntd it to him. Somon
obligingly took th dish from Bagratión (or h would, it smd, hav
hld it till vning and hav gon in to dinnr with it) and drw his
attntion to th vrss.
“Wll, I will rad thm, thn!” Bagratión smd to say, and,
fixing his wary ys on th papr, bgan to rad thm with a fixd and
srious xprssion. But th author himslf took th vrss and bgan
rading thm aloud. Bagratión bowd his had and listnd:
   Bring glory thn to Alxandr’s rign
   And on th thron our Titus shild.
   A dradd fo b thou, kindhartd as a man,
   A Rhiphus at hom, a Casar in th fild!
   ’n fortunat Napolon
   Knows by xprinc, now, Bagratión,
   And dar not Hrculan Russians troubl...
But bfor h had finishd rading, a stntorian major-domo announcd
that dinnr was rady! Th door opnd, and from th dining room cam
th rsounding strains of th polonais:
   Conqust’s joyful thundr wakn,
   Triumph, valiant Russians, now!...
and Count Rostóv, glancing angrily at th author who wnt on rading
his vrss, bowd to Bagratión. vryon ros, fling that dinnr
was mor important than vrss, and Bagratión, again prcding all th
rst, wnt in to dinnr. H was satd in th plac of honor btwn
two Alxandrs—Bklshëv and Narýshkin—which was a significant
allusion to th nam of th sovrign. Thr hundrd prsons took thir
sats in th dining room, according to thir rank and importanc: th
mor important narr to th honord gust, as naturally as watr flows
dpst whr th land lis lowst.
Just bfor dinnr, Count Ilyá Rostóv prsntd his son to Bagratión,
who rcognizd him and said a fw words to him, disjointd and awkward,
as wr all th words h spok that day, and Count Ilyá lookd joyfully
and proudly around whil Bagratión spok to his son.
Nicholas Rostóv, with Dnísov and his nw acquaintanc, Dólokhov, sat
almost at th middl of th tabl. Facing thm sat Pirr, bsid Princ
Nsvítski. Count Ilyá Rostóv with th othr mmbrs of th committ
sat facing Bagratión and, as th vry prsonification of Moscow
hospitality, did th honors to th princ.
His fforts had not bn in vain. Th dinnr, both th Lntn and th
othr far, was splndid, yt h could not fl quit at as till th
nd of th mal. H winkd at th butlr, whisprd dirctions to th
footmn, and awaitd ach xpctd dish with som anxity. vrything
was xcllnt. With th scond cours, a gigantic strlt (at sight of
which Ilyá Rostóv blushd with slf-conscious plasur), th footmn
bgan popping corks and filling th champagn glasss. Aftr th fish,
which mad a crtain snsation, th count xchangd glancs with
th othr committmn. “Thr will b many toasts, it’s tim to
bgin,” h whisprd, and taking up his glass, h ros. All wr
silnt, waiting for what h would say.
“To th halth of our Sovrign, th mpror!” h crid, and at th
sam momnt his kindly ys grw moist with tars of joy and nthusiasm.
Th band immdiatly struck up “Conqust’s joyful thundr
wakn...” All ros and crid “Hurrah!” Bagratión also ros and
shoutd “Hurrah!” in xactly th sam voic in which h had shoutd
it on th fild at Schön Grabrn. Young Rostóv’s cstatic voic
could b hard abov th thr hundrd othrs. H narly wpt. “To th
halth of our Sovrign, th mpror!” h roard, “Hurrah!” and
mptying his glass at on gulp h dashd it to th floor. Many followd
his xampl, and th loud shouting continud for a long tim. Whn th
voics subsidd, th footmn clard away th brokn glass and vrybody
sat down again, smiling at th nois thy had mad and xchanging
rmarks. Th old count ros onc mor, glancd at a not lying bsid
his plat, and proposd a toast, “To th halth of th hro of our
last campaign, Princ Ptr Ivánovich Bagratión!” and again his blu
ys grw moist. “Hurrah!” crid th thr hundrd voics again,
but instad of th band a choir bgan singing a cantata composd by Paul
Ivánovich Kutúzov:
   Russians! O’r all barrirs on!
   Courag conqust guarants;
   Hav w not Bagratión?
   H brings fomn to thir kns,... tc.
As soon as th singing was ovr, anothr and anothr toast was proposd
and Count Ilyá Rostóv bcam mor and mor movd, mor glass was
smashd, and th shouting grw loudr. Thy drank to Bklshëv,
Narýshkin, Uvárov, Dolgorúkov, Apráksin, Valúv, to th committ,
to all th club mmbrs and to all th club gusts, and finally to
Count Ilyá Rostóv sparatly, as th organizr of th banqut. At that
toast, th count took out his handkrchif and, covring his fac, wpt
outright.
CHAPTR IV
Pirr sat opposit Dólokhov and Nicholas Rostóv. As usual, h at and
drank much, and agrly. But thos who knw him intimatly noticd that
som grat chang had com ovr him that day. H was silnt all through
dinnr and lookd about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixd ys and
a look of complt absnt-minddnss, kpt rubbing th bridg of his
nos. His fac was dprssd and gloomy. H smd to s and har
nothing of what was going on around him and to b absorbd by som
dprssing and unsolvd problm.
Th unsolvd problm that tormntd him was causd by hints givn by th
princss, his cousin, at Moscow, concrning Dólokhov’s intimacy with
his wif, and by an anonymous lttr h had rcivd that morning, which
in th man jocular way common to anonymous lttrs said that h saw
badly through his spctacls, but that his wif’s connction with
Dólokhov was a scrt to no on but himslf. Pirr absolutly
disblivd both th princss’ hints and th lttr, but h fard
now to look at Dólokhov, who was sitting opposit him. vry tim
h chancd to mt Dólokhov’s handsom insolnt ys, Pirr flt
somthing trribl and monstrous rising in his soul and turnd quickly
away. Involuntarily rcalling his wif’s past and hr rlations with
Dólokhov, Pirr saw clarly that what was said in th lttr might b
tru, or might at last sm to b tru had it not rfrrd to his wif.
H involuntarily rmmbrd how Dólokhov, who had fully rcovrd his
formr position aftr th campaign, had rturnd to Ptrsburg and com
to him. Availing himslf of his frindly rlations with Pirr as a boon
companion, Dólokhov had com straight to his hous, and Pirr had put
him up and lnt him mony. Pirr rcalld how Hlèn had smilingly
xprssd disapproval of Dólokhov’s living at thir hous, and how
cynically Dólokhov had praisd his wif’s bauty to him and from that
tim till thy cam to Moscow had not lft thm for a day.
“Ys, h is vry handsom,” thought Pirr, “and I know him. It
would b particularly plasant to him to dishonor my nam and ridicul
m, just bcaus I hav xrtd myslf on his bhalf, bfrindd him,
and hlpd him. I know and undrstand what a spic that would add to th
plasur of dciving m, if it rally wr tru. Ys, if it wr tru,
but I do not bliv it. I hav no right to, and can’t, bliv it.”
H rmmbrd th xprssion Dólokhov’s fac assumd in his momnts
of crulty, as whn tying th policman to th bar and dropping thm
into th watr, or whn h challngd a man to a dul without any
rason, or shot a post-boy’s hors with a pistol. That xprssion
was oftn on Dólokhov’s fac whn looking at him. “Ys, h is a
bully,” thought Pirr, “to kill a man mans nothing to him. It must
sm to him that vryon is afraid of him, and that must plas him.
H must think that I, too, am afraid of him—and in fact I am afraid of
him,” h thought, and again h flt somthing trribl and monstrous
rising in his soul. Dólokhov, Dnísov, and Rostóv wr now sitting
opposit Pirr and smd vry gay. Rostóv was talking mrrily to his
two frinds, on of whom was a dashing hussar and th othr a notorious
dulist and rak, and vry now and thn h glancd ironically at
Pirr, whos proccupid, absnt-mindd, and massiv figur was a vry
noticabl on at th dinnr. Rostóv lookd inimically at Pirr,
first bcaus Pirr appard to his hussar ys as a rich civilian, th
husband of a bauty, and in a word—an old woman; and scondly bcaus
Pirr in his proccupation and absnt-minddnss had not rcognizd
Rostóv and had not rspondd to his grting. Whn th mpror’s
halth was drunk, Pirr, lost in thought, did not ris or lift his
glass.
“What ar you about?” shoutd Rostóv, looking at him in an cstasy
of xaspration. “Don’t you har it’s His Majsty th mpror’s
halth?”
Pirr sighd, ros submissivly, mptid his glass, and, waiting till
all wr satd again, turnd with his kindly smil to Rostóv.
“Why, I didn’t rcogniz you!” h said. But Rostóv was othrwis
ngagd; h was shouting “Hurrah!”
“Why don’t you rnw th acquaintanc?” said Dólokhov to Rostóv.
“Confound him, h’s a fool!” said Rostóv.
“On should mak up to th husbands of prtty womn,” said Dnísov.
Pirr did not catch what thy wr saying, but knw thy wr talking
about him. H rddnd and turnd away.
“Wll, now to th halth of handsom womn!” said Dólokhov, and
with a srious xprssion, but with a smil lurking at th cornrs of
his mouth, h turnd with his glass to Pirr.
“Hr’s to th halth of lovly womn, Ptrkin—and thir
lovrs!” h addd.
Pirr, with downcast ys, drank out of his glass without looking at
Dólokhov or answring him. Th footman, who was distributing laflts
with Kutúzov’s cantata, laid on bfor Pirr as on of th
principal gusts. H was just going to tak it whn Dólokhov, laning
across, snatchd it from his hand and bgan rading it. Pirr lookd
at Dólokhov and his ys droppd, th somthing trribl and monstrous
that had tormntd him all dinnrtim ros and took possssion of him.
H land his whol massiv body across th tabl.
“How dar you tak it?” h shoutd.
Haring that cry and sing to whom it was addrssd, Nsvítski and th
nighbor on his right quickly turnd in alarm to Bzúkhov.
“Don’t! Don’t! What ar you about?” whisprd thir frightnd
voics.
Dólokhov lookd at Pirr with clar, mirthful, crul ys, and that
smil of his which smd to say, “Ah! This is what I lik!”
“You shan’t hav it!” h said distinctly.
Pal, with quivring lips, Pirr snatchd th copy.
“You...! you... scoundrl! I challng you!” h jaculatd, and,
pushing back his chair, h ros from th tabl.
At th vry instant h did this and uttrd thos words, Pirr flt
that th qustion of his wif’s guilt which had bn tormnting him
th whol day was finally and indubitably answrd in th affirmativ.
H hatd hr and was forvr sundrd from hr. Dspit Dnísov’s
rqust that h would tak no part in th mattr, Rostóv agrd to b
Dólokhov’s scond, and aftr dinnr h discussd th arrangmnts for
th dul with Nsvítski, Bzúkhov’s scond. Pirr wnt hom, but
Rostóv with Dólokhov and Dnísov stayd on at th club till lat,
listning to th gypsis and othr singrs.
“Wll thn, till tomorrow at Sokólniki,” said Dólokhov, as h took
lav of Rostóv in th club porch.
“And do you fl quit calm?” Rostóv askd.
Dólokhov pausd.
“Wll, you s, I’ll tll you th whol scrt of duling in two
words. If you ar going to fight a dul, and you mak a will and writ
affctionat lttrs to your parnts, and if you think you may b
killd, you ar a fool and ar lost for crtain. But go with th firm
intntion of killing your man as quickly and surly as possibl, and
thn all will b right, as our bar huntsman at Kostromá usd to tll
m. ‘vryon fars a bar,’ h says, ‘but whn you s on your
far’s all gon, and your only thought is not to lt him gt away!’
And that’s how it is with m. À dmain, mon chr.” *
    * Till tomorrow, my dar fllow.
Nxt day, at ight in th morning, Pirr and Nsvítski drov to th
Sokólniki forst and found Dólokhov, Dnísov, and Rostóv alrady
thr. Pirr had th air of a man proccupid with considrations which
had no connction with th mattr in hand. His haggard fac was yllow.
H had vidntly not slpt that night. H lookd about distractdly and
scrwd up his ys as if dazzld by th sun. H was ntirly absorbd
by two considrations: his wif’s guilt, of which aftr his slplss
night h had not th slightst doubt, and th guiltlssnss of
Dólokhov, who had no rason to prsrv th honor of a man who was
nothing to him.... “I should prhaps hav don th sam thing in his
plac,” thought Pirr. “It’s vn crtain that I should hav don
th sam, thn why this dul, this murdr? ithr I shall kill him, or
h will hit m in th had, or lbow, or kn. Can’t I go away from
hr, run away, bury myslf somwhr?” passd through his mind. But
just at momnts whn such thoughts occurrd to him, h would ask in a
particularly calm and absnt-mindd way, which inspird th rspct of
th onlookrs, “Will it b long? Ar things rady?”
Whn all was rady, th sabrs stuck in th snow to mark th barrirs,
and th pistols loadd, Nsvítski wnt up to Pirr.
“I should not b doing my duty, Count,” h said in timid tons,
“and should not justify your confidnc and th honor you hav don
m in choosing m for your scond, if at this grav, this vry
grav, momnt I did not tll you th whol truth. I think thr is no
sufficint ground for this affair, or for blood to b shd ovr it....
You wr not right, not quit in th right, you wr imptuous...”
“Oh ys, it is horribly stupid,” said Pirr.
“Thn allow m to xprss your rgrts, and I am sur your opponnt
will accpt thm,” said Nsvítski (who lik th othrs concrnd in
th affair, and lik vryon in similar cass, did not yt bliv that
th affair had com to an actual dul). “You know, Count, it is much
mor honorabl to admit on’s mistak than to lt mattrs bcom
irrparabl. Thr was no insult on ithr sid. Allow m to
convy....”
“No! What is thr to talk about?” said Pirr. “It’s all th
sam.... Is vrything rady?” h addd. “Only tll m whr to go
and whr to shoot,” h said with an unnaturally gntl smil.
H took th pistol in his hand and bgan asking about th working of th
triggr, as h had not bfor hld a pistol in his hand—a fact that h
did not wish to confss.
“Oh ys, lik that, I know, I only forgot,” said h.
“No apologis, non whatvr,” said Dólokhov to Dnísov (who on
his sid had bn attmpting a rconciliation), and h also wnt up to
th appointd plac.
Th spot chosn for th dul was som ighty pacs from th road,
whr th slighs had bn lft, in a small claring in th pin forst
covrd with mlting snow, th frost having bgun to brak up during th
last fw days. Th antagonists stood forty pacs apart at th farthr
dg of th claring. Th sconds, masuring th pacs, lft tracks in
th dp wt snow btwn th plac whr thy had bn standing and
Nsvítski’s and Dólokhov’s sabrs, which wr stuck into th
ground tn pacs apart to mark th barrir. It was thawing and misty; at
forty pacs’ distanc nothing could b sn. For thr minuts all had
bn rady, but thy still dlayd and all wr silnt.
CHAPTR V
“Wll bgin!” said Dólokhov.
“All right,” said Pirr, still smiling in th sam way. A fling
of drad was in th air. It was vidnt that th affair so lightly bgun
could no longr b avrtd but was taking its cours indpndntly of
mn’s will.
Dnísov first wnt to th barrir and announcd: “As th
adv’sawis hav wfusd a wconciliation, plas pwocd. Tak your
pistols, and at th word thw bgin to advanc.
“O-n! T-wo! Thw!” h shoutd angrily and stppd asid.
Th combatants advancd along th troddn tracks, narr and narr to
on anothr, bginning to s on anothr through th mist. Thy had th
right to fir whn thy likd as thy approachd th barrir. Dólokhov
walkd slowly without raising his pistol, looking intntly with his
bright, sparkling blu ys into his antagonist’s fac. His mouth wor
its usual smblanc of a smil.
“So I can fir whn I lik!” said Pirr, and at th word
“thr,” h wnt quickly forward, missing th troddn path and
stpping into th dp snow. H hld th pistol in his right hand at
arm’s lngth, apparntly afraid of shooting himslf with it. His lft
hand h hld carfully back, bcaus h wishd to support his right
hand with it and knw h must not do so. Having advancd six pacs and
strayd off th track into th snow, Pirr lookd down at his ft,
thn quickly glancd at Dólokhov and, bnding his fingr as h had bn
shown, fird. Not at all xpcting so loud a rport, Pirr shuddrd
at th sound and thn, smiling at his own snsations, stood still. Th
smok, rndrd dnsr by th mist, prvntd him from sing anything
for an instant, but thr was no scond rport as h had xpctd. H
only hard Dólokhov’s hurrid stps, and his figur cam in viw
through th smok. H was prssing on hand to his lft sid, whil
th othr clutchd his drooping pistol. His fac was pal. Rostóv ran
toward him and said somthing.
“No-o-o!” muttrd Dólokhov through his tth, “no, it’s not
ovr.” And aftr stumbling a fw staggring stps right up to th
sabr, h sank on th snow bsid it. His lft hand was bloody; h wipd
it on his coat and supportd himslf with it. His frowning fac was
pallid and quivrd.
“Pla...” bgan Dólokhov, but could not at first pronounc th
word.
“Plas,” h uttrd with an ffort.
Pirr, hardly rstraining his sobs, bgan running toward Dólokhov and
was about to cross th spac btwn th barrirs, whn Dólokhov crid:
“To your barrir!” and Pirr, grasping what was mant, stoppd by
his sabr. Only tn pacs dividd thm. Dólokhov lowrd his had to
th snow, grdily bit at it, again raisd his had, adjustd himslf,
drw in his lgs and sat up, sking a firm cntr of gravity. H suckd
and swallowd th cold snow, his lips quivrd but his ys, still
smiling, glittrd with ffort and xaspration as h mustrd his
rmaining strngth. H raisd his pistol and aimd.
“Sidways! Covr yourslf with your pistol!” jaculatd Nsvítski.
“Covr yourslf!” vn Dnísov crid to his advrsary.
Pirr, with a gntl smil of pity and rmors, his arms and lgs
hlplssly sprad out, stood with his broad chst dirctly facing
Dólokhov and lookd sorrowfully at him. Dnísov, Rostóv, and
Nsvítski closd thir ys. At th sam instant thy hard a rport
and Dólokhov’s angry cry.
“Missd!” shoutd Dólokhov, and h lay hlplssly, fac downwards
on th snow.
Pirr clutchd his tmpls, and turning round wnt into th forst,
trampling through th dp snow, and muttring incohrnt words:
“Folly... folly! Dath... lis...” h rpatd, puckring his fac.
Nsvítski stoppd him and took him hom.
Rostóv and Dnísov drov away with th woundd Dólokhov.
Th lattr lay silnt in th sligh with closd ys and did not answr
a word to th qustions addrssd to him. But on ntring Moscow h
suddnly cam to and, lifting his had with an ffort, took Rostóv, who
was sitting bsid him, by th hand. Rostóv was struck by th
totally altrd and unxpctdly rapturous and tndr xprssion on
Dólokhov’s fac.
“Wll? How do you fl?” h askd.
“Bad! But it’s not that, my frind—” said Dólokhov with a
gasping voic. “Whr ar w? In Moscow, I know. I don’t mattr,
but I hav killd hr, killd... Sh won’t gt ovr it! Sh won’t
surviv....”
“Who?” askd Rostóv.
“My mothr! My mothr, my angl, my adord angl mothr,” and
Dólokhov prssd Rostóv’s hand and burst into tars.
Whn h had bcom a littl quitr, h xplaind to Rostóv that h was
living with his mothr, who, if sh saw him dying, would not surviv it.
H implord Rostóv to go on and prpar hr.
Rostóv wnt on ahad to do what was askd, and to his grat surpris
larnd that Dólokhov th brawlr, Dólokhov th bully, livd in Moscow
with an old mothr and a hunchback sistr, and was th most affctionat
of sons and brothrs.
CHAPTR VI
Pirr had of lat rarly sn his wif alon. Both in Ptrsburg and in
Moscow thir hous was always full of visitors. Th night aftr th
dul h did not go to his bdroom but, as h oftn did, rmaind in his
fathr’s room, that hug room in which Count Bzúkhov had did.
H lay down on th sofa maning to fall aslp and forgt all that
had happnd to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of flings,
thoughts, and mmoris suddnly aros within him that h could not fall
aslp, nor vn rmain in on plac, but had to jump up and pac th
room with rapid stps. Now h smd to s hr in th arly days of
thir marriag, with bar shouldrs and a languid, passionat look on
hr fac, and thn immdiatly h saw bsid hr Dólokhov’s handsom,
insolnt, hard, and mocking fac as h had sn it at th banqut, and
thn that sam fac pal, quivring, and suffring, as it had bn whn
h rld and sank on th snow.
“What has happnd?” h askd himslf. “I hav killd hr lovr,
ys, killd my wif’s lovr. Ys, that was it! And why? How did I com
to do it?”—“Bcaus you marrid hr,” answrd an innr voic.
“But in what was I to blam?” h askd. “In marrying hr without
loving hr; in dciving yourslf and hr.” And h vividly rcalld
that momnt aftr suppr at Princ Vasíli’s, whn h spok thos
words h had found so difficult to uttr: “I lov you.” “It all
coms from that! vn thn I flt it,” h thought. “I flt thn that
it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.”
H rmmbrd his honymoon and blushd at th rcollction.
Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shamful was th rcollction of
how on day soon aftr his marriag h cam out of th bdroom into his
study a littl bfor noon in his silk drssing gown and found his had
stward thr, who, bowing rspctfully, lookd into his fac and at
his drssing gown and smild slightly, as if xprssing rspctful
undrstanding of his mployr’s happinss.
“But how oftn I hav flt proud of hr, proud of hr majstic bauty
and social tact,” thought h; “bn proud of my hous, in which sh
rcivd all Ptrsburg, proud of hr unapproachability and bauty. So
this is what I was proud of! I thn thought that I did not undrstand
hr. How oftn whn considring hr charactr I hav told myslf that
I was to blam for not undrstanding hr, for not undrstanding that
constant composur and complacncy and lack of all intrsts or dsirs,
and th whol scrt lis in th trribl truth that sh is a dpravd
woman. Now I hav spokn that trribl word to myslf all has bcom
clar.
“Anatol usd to com to borrow mony from hr and usd to kiss hr
nakd shouldrs. Sh did not giv him th mony, but lt hrslf b
kissd. Hr fathr in jst trid to rous hr jalousy, and sh rplid
with a calm smil that sh was not so stupid as to b jalous: ‘Lt
him do what h plass,’ sh usd to say of m. On day I askd hr if
sh flt any symptoms of prgnancy. Sh laughd contmptuously and said
sh was not a fool to want to hav childrn, and that sh was not going
to hav any childrn by m.”
Thn h rcalld th coarsnss and bluntnss of hr thoughts and th
vulgarity of th xprssions that wr natural to hr, though sh had
bn brought up in th most aristocratic circls.
“I’m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allz-vous
promnr,” * sh usd to say. Oftn sing th succss sh had with
young and old mn and womn Pirr could not undrstand why h did not
lov hr.
    * “You clar out of this.”
“Ys, I nvr lovd hr,” said h to himslf; “I knw sh was a
dpravd woman,” h rpatd, “but dard not admit it to myslf.
And now thr’s Dólokhov sitting in th snow with a forcd smil and
prhaps dying, whil mting my rmors with som forcd bravado!”
Pirr was on of thos popl who, in spit of an apparanc of what
is calld wak charactr, do not sk a confidant in thir troubls. H
digstd his suffrings alon.
“It is all, all hr fault,” h said to himslf; “but what of that?
Why did I bind myslf to hr? Why did I say ‘J vous aim’ * to hr,
which was a li, and wors than a li? I am guilty and must ndur...
what? A slur on my nam? A misfortun for lif? Oh, that’s
nonsns,” h thought. “Th slur on my nam and honor—that’s all
apart from myslf.”
    * I lov you.
“Louis XVI was xcutd bcaus thy said h was dishonorabl and a
criminal,” cam into Pirr’s had, “and from thir point of
viw thy wr right, as wr thos too who canonizd him and did a
martyr’s dath for his sak. Thn Robspirr was bhadd for bing
a dspot. Who is right and who is wrong? No on! But if you ar
aliv—liv: tomorrow you’ll di as I might hav did an hour ago.
And is it worth tormnting onslf, whn on has only a momnt of lif
in comparison with trnity?”
But at th momnt whn h imagind himslf calmd by such rflctions,
sh suddnly cam into his mind as sh was at th momnts whn h had
most strongly xprssd his insincr lov for hr, and h flt th
blood rush to his hart and had again to gt up and mov about and brak
and tar whatvr cam to his hand. “Why did I tll hr that ‘J
vous aim’?” h kpt rpating to himslf. And whn h had said it
for th tnth tim, Molièr’s words: “Mais qu diabl allait-il
fair dans ctt galèr?” * occurrd to him, and h bgan to laugh at
himslf.
      * “But what th dvil was h doing in that gally?”
In th night h calld his valt and told him to pack up to go to
Ptrsburg. H could not imagin how h could spak to hr now. H
rsolvd to go away nxt day and lav a lttr informing hr of his
intntion to part from hr forvr.
Nxt morning whn th valt cam into th room with his coff, Pirr
was lying aslp on th ottoman with an opn book in his hand.
H wok up and lookd round for a whil with a startld xprssion,
unabl to raliz whr h was.
“Th countss told m to inquir whthr your xcllncy was at
hom,” said th valt.
But bfor Pirr could dcid what answr h would snd, th countss
hrslf in a whit satin drssing gown mbroidrd with silvr and with
simply drssd hair (two immns plaits twic round hr lovly had lik
a coront) ntrd th room, calm and majstic, xcpt that thr was
a wrathful wrinkl on hr rathr prominnt marbl brow. With hr
imprturbabl calm sh did not bgin to spak in front of th valt.
Sh knw of th dul and had com to spak about it. Sh waitd till th
valt had st down th coff things and lft th room. Pirr lookd
at hr timidly ovr his spctacls, and lik a har surroundd by hounds
who lays back hr ars and continus to crouch motionlss bfor hr
nmis, h trid to continu rading. But fling this to b snslss
and impossibl, h again glancd timidly at hr. Sh did not sit down
but lookd at him with a contmptuous smil, waiting for th valt to
go.
“Wll, what’s this now? What hav you bn up to now, I should lik
to know?” sh askd strnly.
“I? What hav I...?” stammrd Pirr.
“So it sms you’r a hro, h? Com now, what was this dul about?
What is it mant to prov? What? I ask you.”
Pirr turnd ovr havily on th ottoman and opnd his mouth, but
could not rply.
“If you won’t answr, I’ll tll you...” Hlèn wnt on. “You
bliv vrything you’r told. You wr told...” Hlèn laughd,
“that Dólokhov was my lovr,” sh said in Frnch with hr coars
plainnss of spch, uttring th word amant as casually as any othr
word, “and you blivd it! Wll, what hav you provd? What dos this
dul prov? That you’r a fool, qu vous êts un sot, but vrybody
knw that. What will b th rsult? That I shall b th laughingstock of
all Moscow, that vryon will say that you, drunk and not knowing what
you wr about, challngd a man you ar jalous of without caus.”
Hlèn raisd hr voic and bcam mor and mor xcitd, “A man
who’s a bttr man than you in vry way...”
“Hm... Hm...!” growld Pirr, frowning without looking at hr, and
not moving a muscl.
“And how could you bliv h was my lovr? Why? Bcaus I lik
his company? If you wr clvrr and mor agrabl, I should prfr
yours.”
“Don’t spak to m... I bg you,” muttrd Pirr hoarsly.
“Why shouldn’t I spak? I can spak as I lik, and I tll you
plainly that thr ar not many wivs with husbands such as you who
would not hav takn lovrs (ds amants), but I hav not don so,”
said sh.
Pirr wishd to say somthing, lookd at hr with ys whos strang
xprssion sh did not undrstand, and lay down again. H was suffring
physically at that momnt, thr was a wight on his chst and h could
not brath. H knw that h must do somthing to put an nd to this
suffring, but what h wantd to do was too trribl.
“W had bttr sparat,” h muttrd in a brokn voic.
“Sparat? Vry wll, but only if you giv m a fortun,” said
Hlèn. “Sparat! That’s a thing to frightn m with!”
Pirr lapd up from th sofa and rushd staggring toward hr.
“I’ll kill you!” h shoutd, and sizing th marbl top of a tabl
with a strngth h had nvr bfor flt, h mad a stp toward hr
brandishing th slab.
Hlèn’s fac bcam trribl, sh shrikd and sprang asid. His
fathr’s natur showd itslf in Pirr. H flt th fascination and
dlight of frnzy. H flung down th slab, brok it, and swooping
down on hr with outstrtchd hands shoutd, “Gt out!” in such a
trribl voic that th whol hous hard it with horror. God knows what
h would hav don at that momnt had Hlèn not fld from th room.
A wk latr Pirr gav his wif full powr to control all his stats
in Grat Russia, which formd th largr part of his proprty, and lft
for Ptrsburg alon.
CHAPTR VII
Two months had lapsd sinc th nws of th battl of Austrlitz and
th loss of Princ Andrw had rachd Bald Hills, and in spit of th
lttrs snt through th mbassy and all th sarchs mad, his body had
not bn found nor was h on th list of prisonrs. What was worst of
all for his rlations was th fact that thr was still a possibility of
his having bn pickd up on th battlfild by th popl of th
plac and that h might now b lying, rcovring or dying, alon among
strangrs and unabl to snd nws of himslf. Th gaztts from which
th old princ first hard of th dfat at Austrlitz statd, as usual
vry brifly and vaguly, that aftr brilliant ngagmnts th Russians
had had to rtrat and had mad thir withdrawal in prfct ordr. Th
old princ undrstood from this official rport that our army had bn
dfatd. A wk aftr th gaztt rport of th battl of Austrlitz
cam a lttr from Kutúzov informing th princ of th fat that had
bfalln his son.
“Your son,” wrot Kutúzov, “fll bfor my ys, a standard in
his hand and at th had of a rgimnt—h fll as a hro, worthy of
his fathr and his fathrland. To th grat rgrt of myslf and of th
whol army it is still uncrtain whthr h is aliv or not. I comfort
myslf and you with th hop that your son is aliv, for othrwis
h would hav bn mntiond among th officrs found on th fild of
battl, a list of whom has bn snt m undr flag of truc.”
Aftr rciving this nws lat in th vning, whn h was alon in his
study, th old princ wnt for his walk as usual nxt morning, but h
was silnt with his stward, th gardnr, and th architct, and though
h lookd vry grim h said nothing to anyon.
Whn Princss Mary wnt to him at th usual hour h was working at his
lath and, as usual, did not look round at hr.
“Ah, Princss Mary!” h said suddnly in an unnatural voic,
throwing down his chisl. (Th whl continud to rvolv by its own
imptus, and Princss Mary long rmmbrd th dying crak of that
whl, which mrgd in hr mmory with what followd.)
Sh approachd him, saw his fac, and somthing gav way within hr. Hr
ys grw dim. By th xprssion of hr fathr’s fac, not sad, not
crushd, but angry and working unnaturally, sh saw that hanging ovr
hr and about to crush hr was som trribl misfortun, th worst
in lif, on sh had not yt xprincd, irrparabl and
incomprhnsibl—th dath of on sh lovd.
“Fathr! Andrw!”—said th ungracful, awkward princss with such
an indscribabl charm of sorrow and slf-forgtfulnss that hr fathr
could not bar hr look but turnd away with a sob.
“Bad nws! H’s not among th prisonrs nor among th killd!
Kutúzov writs...” and h scramd as pircingly as if h wishd to
driv th princss away by that scram... “Killd!”
Th princss did not fall down or faint. Sh was alrady pal, but on
haring ths words hr fac changd and somthing brightnd in hr
bautiful, radiant ys. It was as if joy—a suprm joy apart from th
joys and sorrows of this world—ovrflowd th grat grif within hr.
Sh forgot all far of hr fathr, wnt up to him, took his hand, and
drawing him down put hr arm round his thin, scraggy nck.
“Fathr,” sh said, “do not turn away from m, lt us wp
togthr.”
“Scoundrls! Blackguards!” shrikd th old man, turning his fac
away from hr. “Dstroying th army, dstroying th mn! And why? Go,
go and tll Lis.”
Th princss sank hlplssly into an armchair bsid hr fathr and
wpt. Sh saw hr brothr now as h had bn at th momnt whn h took
lav of hr and of Lis, his look tndr yt proud. Sh saw him tndr
and amusd as h was whn h put on th littl icon. “Did h bliv?
Had h rpntd of his unblif? Was h now thr? Thr in th ralms
of trnal pac and blssdnss?” sh thought.
“Fathr, tll m how it happnd,” sh askd through hr tars.
“Go! Go! Killd in battl, whr th bst of Russian mn and
Russia’s glory wr ld to dstruction. Go, Princss Mary. Go and tll
Lis. I will follow.”
Whn Princss Mary rturnd from hr fathr, th littl princss sat
working and lookd up with that curious xprssion of innr, happy calm
pculiar to prgnant womn. It was vidnt that hr ys did not s
Princss Mary but wr looking within... into hrslf... at somthing
joyful and mystrious taking plac within hr.
“Mary,” sh said, moving away from th mbroidry fram and lying
back, “giv m your hand.” Sh took hr sistr-in-law’s hand and
hld it blow hr waist.
Hr ys wr smiling xpctantly, hr downy lip ros and rmaind
liftd in childlik happinss.
Princss Mary knlt down bfor hr and hid hr fac in th folds of hr
sistr-in-law’s drss.
“Thr, thr! Do you fl it? I fl so strang. And do you know,
Mary, I am going to lov him vry much,” said Lis, looking with
bright and happy ys at hr sistr-in-law.
Princss Mary could not lift hr had, sh was wping.
“What is th mattr, Mary?”
“Nothing... only I fl sad... sad about Andrw,” sh said, wiping
away hr tars on hr sistr-in-law’s kn.
Svral tims in th cours of th morning Princss Mary bgan trying to
prpar hr sistr-in-law, and vry tim bgan to cry. Unobsrvant as
was th littl princss, ths tars, th caus of which sh did not
undrstand, agitatd hr. Sh said nothing but lookd about unasily as
if in sarch of somthing. Bfor dinnr th old princ, of whom sh was
always afraid, cam into hr room with a pculiarly rstlss and malign
xprssion and wnt out again without saying a word. Sh lookd at
Princss Mary, thn sat thinking for a whil with that xprssion of
attntion to somthing within hr that is only sn in prgnant womn,
and suddnly bgan to cry.
“Has anything com from Andrw?” sh askd.
“No, you know it’s too soon for nws. But my fathr is anxious and I
fl afraid.”
“So thr’s nothing?”
“Nothing,” answrd Princss Mary, looking firmly with hr radiant
ys at hr sistr-in-law.
Sh had dtrmind not to tll hr and prsuadd hr fathr to hid th
trribl nws from hr till aftr hr confinmnt, which was xpctd
within a fw days. Princss Mary and th old princ ach bor and hid
thir grif in thir own way. Th old princ would not chrish any hop:
h mad up his mind that Princ Andrw had bn killd, and though h
snt an official to Austria to sk for tracs of his son, h ordrd a
monumnt from Moscow which h intndd to rct in his own gardn to his
mmory, and h told vrybody that his son had bn killd. H trid not
to chang his formr way of lif, but his strngth faild him. H walkd
lss, at lss, slpt lss, and bcam wakr vry day. Princss Mary
hopd. Sh prayd for hr brothr as living and was always awaiting nws
of his rturn.
CHAPTR VIII
“Darst,” said th littl princss aftr brakfast on th morning
of th nintnth March, and hr downy littl lip ros from old habit,
but as sorrow was manifst in vry smil, th sound of vry word, and
vn vry footstp in that hous sinc th trribl nws had com, so
now th smil of th littl princss—influncd by th gnral mood
though without knowing its caus—was such as to rmind on still mor
of th gnral sorrow.
“Darst, I’m afraid this morning’s fruschtiqu *—as Fóka th
cook calls it—has disagrd with m.”
    * Frühstück: brakfast.
“What is th mattr with you, my darling? You look pal. Oh, you
ar vry pal!” said Princss Mary in alarm, running with hr soft,
pondrous stps up to hr sistr-in-law.
“Your xcllncy, should not Mary Bogdánovna b snt for?” said on
of th maids who was prsnt. (Mary Bogdánovna was a midwif from th
nighboring town, who had bn at Bald Hills for th last fortnight.)
“Oh ys,” assntd Princss Mary, “prhaps that’s it. I’ll go.
Courag, my angl.” Sh kissd Lis and was about to lav th room.
“Oh, no, no!” And bsids th pallor and th physical suffring
on th littl princss’ fac, an xprssion of childish far of
invitabl pain showd itslf.
“No, it’s only indigstion?... Say it’s only indigstion, say so,
Mary! Say...” And th littl princss bgan to cry capriciously lik
a suffring child and to wring hr littl hands vn with som
affctation. Princss Mary ran out of th room to ftch Mary
Bogdánovna.
“Mon Diu! Mon Diu! Oh!” sh hard as sh lft th room.
Th midwif was alrady on hr way to mt hr, rubbing hr small, plump
whit hands with an air of calm importanc.
“Mary Bogdánovna, I think it’s bginning!” said Princss Mary
looking at th midwif with wid-opn ys of alarm.
“Wll, th Lord b thankd, Princss,” said Mary Bogdánovna, not
hastning hr stps. “You young ladis should not know anything about
it.”
“But how is it th doctor from Moscow is not hr yt?” said th
princss. (In accordanc with Lis’s and Princ Andrw’s wishs thy
had snt in good tim to Moscow for a doctor and wr xpcting him at
any momnt.)
“No mattr, Princss, don’t b alarmd,” said Mary Bogdánovna.
“W’ll manag vry wll without a doctor.”
Fiv minuts latr Princss Mary from hr room hard somthing havy
bing carrid by. Sh lookd out. Th mn srvants wr carrying th
larg lathr sofa from Princ Andrw’s study into th bdroom. On
thir facs was a quit and solmn look.
Princss Mary sat alon in hr room listning to th sounds in th
hous, now and thn opning hr door whn somon passd and watching
what was going on in th passag. Som womn passing with quit stps in
and out of th bdroom glancd at th princss and turnd away. Sh did
not vntur to ask any qustions, and shut th door again, now sitting
down in hr asy chair, now taking hr prayr book, now knling bfor
th icon stand. To hr surpris and distrss sh found that hr prayrs
did not calm hr xcitmnt. Suddnly hr door opnd softly and hr old
nurs, Praskóvya Sávishna, who hardly vr cam to that room as th
old princ had forbiddn it, appard on th thrshold with a shawl
round hr had.
“I’v com to sit with you a bit, Másha,” said th nurs, “and
hr I’v brought th princ’s wdding candls to light bfor his
saint, my angl,” sh said with a sigh.
“Oh, nurs, I’m so glad!”
“God is mrciful, birdi.”
Th nurs lit th gilt candls bfor th icons and sat down by th door
with hr knitting. Princss Mary took a book and bgan rading. Only
whn footstps or voics wr hard did thy look at on anothr, th
princss anxious and inquiring, th nurs ncouraging. vryon in th
hous was dominatd by th sam fling that Princss Mary xprincd
as sh sat in hr room. But owing to th suprstition that th fwr
th popl who know of it th lss a woman in travail suffrs, vryon
trid to prtnd not to know; no on spok of it, but apart from th
ordinary staid and rspctful good mannrs habitual in th princ’s
houshold, a common anxity, a softning of th hart, and a
consciousnss that somthing grat and mystrious was bing accomplishd
at that momnt mad itslf flt.
Thr was no laughtr in th maids’ larg hall. In th mn srvants’
hall all sat waiting, silntly and alrt. In th outlying srfs’
quartrs torchs and candls wr burning and no on slpt. Th old
princ, stpping on his hls, pacd up and down his study and snt
Tíkhon to ask Mary Bogdánovna what nws.—“Say only that ‘th
princ told m to ask,’ and com and tll m hr answr.”
“Inform th princ that labor has bgun,” said Mary Bogdánovna,
giving th mssngr a significant look.
Tíkhon wnt and told th princ.
“Vry good!” said th princ closing th door bhind him, and
Tíkhon did not har th slightst sound from th study aftr that.
Aftr a whil h r-ntrd it as if to snuff th candls, and, sing
th princ was lying on th sofa, lookd at him, noticd his prturbd
fac, shook his had, and going up to him silntly kissd him on th
shouldr and lft th room without snuffing th candls or saying why h
had ntrd. Th most solmn mystry in th world continud its cours.
vning passd, night cam, and th fling of suspns and softning of
hart in th prsnc of th unfathomabl did not lssn but incrasd.
No on slpt.
It was on of thos March nights whn wintr sms to wish to rsum its
sway and scattrs its last snows and storms with dsprat fury. A rlay
of horss had bn snt up th highroad to mt th Grman doctor from
Moscow who was xpctd vry momnt, and mn on horsback with lantrns
wr snt to th crossroads to guid him ovr th country road with its
hollows and snow-covrd pools of watr.
Princss Mary had long sinc put asid hr book: sh sat silnt, hr
luminous ys fixd on hr nurs’s wrinkld fac (vry lin of which
sh knw so wll), on th lock of gray hair that scapd from undr th
krchif, and th loos skin that hung undr hr chin.
Nurs Sávishna, knitting in hand, was tlling in low tons, scarcly
haring or undrstanding hr own words, what sh had told hundrds of
tims bfor: how th lat princss had givn birth to Princss Mary
in Kishnëv with only a Moldavian pasant woman to hlp instad of a
midwif.
“God is mrciful, doctors ar nvr ndd,” sh said.
Suddnly a gust of wind bat violntly against th casmnt of th
window, from which th doubl fram had bn rmovd (by ordr of th
princ, on window fram was rmovd in ach room as soon as th larks
rturnd), and, forcing opn a loosly closd latch, st th damask
curtain flapping and blw out th candl with its chill, snowy draft.
Princss Mary shuddrd; hr nurs, putting down th stocking sh was
knitting, wnt to th window and laning out trid to catch th opn
casmnt. Th cold wind flappd th nds of hr krchif and hr loos
locks of gray hair.
“Princss, my dar, thr’s somon driving up th avnu!” sh
said, holding th casmnt and not closing it. “With lantrns. Most
likly th doctor.”
“Oh, my God! thank God!” said Princss Mary. “I must go and mt
him, h dos not know Russian.”
Princss Mary thrw a shawl ovr hr had and ran to mt th nwcomr.
As sh was crossing th antroom sh saw through th window a carriag
with lantrns, standing at th ntranc. Sh wnt out on th stairs. On
a banistr post stood a tallow candl which guttrd in th draft. On
th landing blow, Philip, th footman, stood looking scard and holding
anothr candl. Still lowr, byond th turn of th staircas, on
could har th footstp of somon in thick flt boots, and a voic that
smd familiar to Princss Mary was saying somthing.
“Thank God!” said th voic. “And Fathr?”
“Gon to bd,” rplid th voic of Dmyán th hous stward, who
was downstairs.
Thn th voic said somthing mor, Dmyán rplid, and th stps in
th flt boots approachd th unsn bnd of th staircas mor rapidly.
“It’s Andrw!” thought Princss Mary. “No it can’t b, that
would b too xtraordinary,” and at th vry momnt sh thought this,
th fac and figur of Princ Andrw, in a fur cloak th dp collar of
which covrd with snow, appard on th landing whr th footman
stood with th candl. Ys, it was h, pal, thin, with a changd and
strangly softnd but agitatd xprssion on his fac. H cam up th
stairs and mbracd his sistr.
“You did not gt my lttr?” h askd, and not waiting for a
rply—which h would not hav rcivd, for th princss was unabl to
spak—h turnd back, rapidly mountd th stairs again with th
doctor who had ntrd th hall aftr him (thy had mt at th last post
station), and again mbracd his sistr.
“What a strang fat, Másha darling!” And having takn off his
cloak and flt boots, h wnt to th littl princss’ apartmnt.
CHAPTR IX
Th littl princss lay supportd by pillows, with a whit cap on hr
had (th pains had just lft hr). Strands of hr black hair lay round
hr inflamd and prspiring chks, hr charming rosy mouth with its
downy lip was opn and sh was smiling joyfully. Princ Andrw ntrd
and pausd facing hr at th foot of th sofa on which sh was lying.
Hr glittring ys, filld with childlik far and xcitmnt, rstd
on him without changing thir xprssion. “I lov you all and hav
don no harm to anyon; why must I suffr so? Hlp m!” hr look
smd to say. Sh saw hr husband, but did not raliz th significanc
of his apparanc bfor hr now. Princ Andrw wnt round th sofa and
kissd hr forhad.
“My darling!” h said—a word h had nvr usd to hr bfor.
“God is mrciful....”
Sh lookd at him inquiringly and with childlik rproach.
“I xpctd hlp from you and I gt non, non from you ithr!”
said hr ys. Sh was not surprisd at his having com; sh did
not raliz that h had com. His coming had nothing to do with
hr suffrings or with thir rlif. Th pangs bgan again and Mary
Bogdánovna advisd Princ Andrw to lav th room.
Th doctor ntrd. Princ Andrw wnt out and, mting Princss Mary,
again joind hr. Thy bgan talking in whisprs, but thir talk brok
off at vry momnt. Thy waitd and listnd.
“Go, dar,” said Princss Mary.
Princ Andrw wnt again to his wif and sat waiting in th room nxt
to hrs. A woman cam from th bdroom with a frightnd fac and bcam
confusd whn sh saw Princ Andrw. H covrd his fac with his hands
and rmaind so for som minuts. Pitous, hlplss, animal moans cam
through th door. Princ Andrw got up, wnt to th door, and trid to
opn it. Somon was holding it shut.
“You can’t com in! You can’t!” said a trrifid voic from
within.
H bgan pacing th room. Th scraming casd, and a fw mor sconds
wnt by. Thn suddnly a trribl shrik—it could not b hrs, sh
could not scram lik that—cam from th bdroom. Princ Andrw ran to
th door; th scram casd and h hard th wail of an infant.
“What hav thy takn a baby in thr for?” thought Princ Andrw in
th first scond. “A baby? What baby...? Why is thr a baby thr? Or
is th baby born?”
Thn suddnly h ralizd th joyful significanc of that wail; tars
chokd him, and laning his lbows on th window sill h bgan to cry,
sobbing lik a child. Th door opnd. Th doctor with his shirt slvs
tuckd up, without a coat, pal and with a trmbling jaw, cam out
of th room. Princ Andrw turnd to him, but th doctor gav him a
bwildrd look and passd by without a word. A woman rushd out and
sing Princ Andrw stoppd, hsitating on th thrshold. H wnt into
his wif’s room. Sh was lying dad, in th sam position h had sn
hr in fiv minuts bfor and, dspit th fixd ys and th pallor of
th chks, th sam xprssion was on hr charming childlik fac with
its uppr lip covrd with tiny black hair.
“I lov you all, and hav don no harm to anyon; and what hav you
don to m?”—said hr charming, pathtic, dad fac.
In a cornr of th room somthing rd and tiny gav a grunt and squald
in Mary Bogdánovna’s trmbling whit hands.
Two hours latr Princ Andrw, stpping softly, wnt into his fathr’s
room. Th old man alrady knw vrything. H was standing clos to
th door and as soon as it opnd his rough old arms closd lik a vis
round his son’s nck, and without a word h bgan to sob lik a child.
Thr days latr th littl princss was burid, and Princ Andrw wnt
up th stps to whr th coffin stood, to giv hr th farwll kiss.
And thr in th coffin was th sam fac, though with closd ys.
“Ah, what hav you don to m?” it still smd to say, and Princ
Andrw flt that somthing gav way in his soul and that h was guilty
of a sin h could nithr rmdy nor forgt. H could not wp. Th
old man too cam up and kissd th waxn littl hands that lay quitly
crossd on on th othr on hr brast, and to him, too, hr fac smd
to say: “Ah, what hav you don to m, and why?” And at th sight
th old man turnd angrily away.
Anothr fiv days passd, and thn th young Princ Nicholas Andrvich
was baptizd. Th wt nurs supportd th covrlt with hr chin, whil
th prist with a goos fathr anointd th boy’s littl rd and
wrinkld sols and palms.
His grandfathr, who was his godfathr, trmbling and afraid of dropping
him, carrid th infant round th battrd tin font and handd him ovr
to th godmothr, Princss Mary. Princ Andrw sat in anothr room,
faint with far lst th baby should b drownd in th font, and awaitd
th trmination of th crmony. H lookd up joyfully at th baby whn
th nurs brought it to him and noddd approval whn sh told him that
th wax with th baby’s hair had not sunk in th font but had floatd.
CHAPTR X
Rostóv’s shar in Dólokhov’s dul with Bzúkhov was hushd up by
th fforts of th old count, and instad of bing dgradd to th ranks
as h xpctd h was appointd an adjutant to th govrnor gnral of
Moscow. As a rsult h could not go to th country with th rst of th
family, but was kpt all summr in Moscow by his nw dutis. Dólokhov
rcovrd, and Rostóv bcam vry frindly with him during his
convalscnc. Dólokhov lay ill at his mothr’s who lovd him
passionatly and tndrly, and old Mary Ivánovna, who had grown fond of
Rostóv for his frindship to hr Fdya, oftn talkd to him about hr
son.
“Ys, Count,” sh would say, “h is too nobl and pur-sould for
our prsnt, dpravd world. No on now lovs virtu; it sms lik
a rproach to vryon. Now tll m, Count, was it right, was it
honorabl, of Bzúkhov? And Fdya, with his nobl spirit, lovd him
and vn now nvr says a word against him. Thos pranks in Ptrsburg
whn thy playd som tricks on a policman, didn’t thy do it
togthr? And thr! Bzúkhov got off scotfr, whil Fdya had to
bar th whol burdn on his shouldrs. Fancy what h had to go through!
It’s tru h has bn rinstatd, but how could thy fail to do that?
I think thr wr not many such gallant sons of th fathrland out
thr as h. And now—this dul! Hav ths popl no fling, or
honor? Knowing him to b an only son, to challng him and shoot so
straight! It’s wll God had mrcy on us. And what was it for? Who
dosn’t hav intrigus nowadays? Why, if h was so jalous, as I s
things h should hav shown it soonr, but h lts it go on for months.
And thn to call him out, rckoning on Fdya not fighting bcaus h
owd him mony! What basnss! What mannss! I know you undrstand
Fdya, my dar count; that, bliv m, is why I am so fond of you. Fw
popl do undrstand him. H is such a lofty, havnly soul!”
Dólokhov himslf during his convalscnc spok to Rostóv in a way no
on would hav xpctd of him.
“I know popl considr m a bad man!” h said. “Lt thm! I
don’t car a straw about anyon but thos I lov; but thos I lov,
I lov so that I would giv my lif for thm, and th othrs I’d
throttl if thy stood in my way. I hav an adord, a priclss mothr,
and two or thr frinds—you among thm—and as for th rst I only
car about thm in so far as thy ar harmful or usful. And most of
thm ar harmful, spcially th womn. Ys, dar boy,” h continud,
“I hav mt loving, nobl, high-mindd mn, but I hav not yt mt
any womn—countsss or cooks—who wr not vnal. I hav not yt mt
that divin purity and dvotion I look for in womn. If I found such a
on I’d giv my lif for hr! But thos!...” and h mad a gstur
of contmpt. “And bliv m, if I still valu my lif it is
only bcaus I still hop to mt such a divin cratur, who will
rgnrat, purify, and lvat m. But you don’t undrstand it.”
“Oh, ys, I quit undrstand,” answrd Rostóv, who was undr his
nw frind’s influnc.
In th autumn th Rostóvs rturnd to Moscow. arly in th wintr
Dnísov also cam back and stayd with thm. Th first half of th
wintr of 1806, which Nicholas Rostóv spnt in Moscow, was on of th
happist, mrrist tims for him and th whol family. Nicholas brought
many young mn to his parnts’ hous. Vra was a handsom girl
of twnty; Sónya a girl of sixtn with all th charm of an opning
flowr; Natásha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly
amusing, now girlishly nchanting.
At that tim in th Rostóvs’ hous thr prvaild an amorous
atmosphr charactristic of homs whr thr ar vry young and vry
charming girls. vry young man who cam to th hous—sing thos
imprssionabl, smiling young facs (smiling probably at thir own
happinss), fling th agr bustl around him, and haring th fitful
bursts of song and music and th inconsqunt but frindly prattl of
young girls rady for anything and full of hop—xprincd th sam
fling; sharing with th young folk of th Rostóvs’ houshold a
radinss to fall in lov and an xpctation of happinss.
Among th young mn introducd by Rostóv on of th first was
Dólokhov, whom vryon in th hous likd xcpt Natásha. Sh almost
quarrld with hr brothr about him. Sh insistd that h was a bad
man, and that in th dul with Bzúkhov, Pirr was right and Dólokhov
wrong, and furthr that h was disagrabl and unnatural.
“Thr’s nothing for m to undrstand,” sh crid out with
rsolut slf-will, “h is wickd and hartlss. Thr now, I lik
your Dnísov though h is a rak and all that, still I lik him; so
you s I do undrstand. I don’t know how to put it... with this on
vrything is calculatd, and I don’t lik that. But Dnísov...”
“Oh, Dnísov is quit diffrnt,” rplid Nicholas, implying that
vn Dnísov was nothing compard to Dólokhov—“you must undrstand
what a soul thr is in Dólokhov, you should s him with his mothr.
What a hart!”
“Wll, I don’t know about that, but I am uncomfortabl with him. And
do you know h has falln in lov with Sónya?”
“What nonsns...”
“I’m crtain of it; you’ll s.”
Natásha’s prdiction provd tru. Dólokhov, who did not usually car
for th socity of ladis, bgan to com oftn to th hous, and th
qustion for whos sak h cam (though no on spok of it) was soon
sttld. H cam bcaus of Sónya. And Sónya, though sh would nvr
hav dard to say so, knw it and blushd scarlt vry tim Dólokhov
appard.
Dólokhov oftn dind at th Rostóvs’, nvr missd a prformanc at
which thy wr prsnt, and wnt to Iogl’s balls for young popl
which th Rostóvs always attndd. H was pointdly attntiv to Sónya
and lookd at hr in such a way that not only could sh not bar his
glancs without coloring, but vn th old countss and Natásha blushd
whn thy saw his looks.
It was vidnt that this strang, strong man was undr th irrsistibl
influnc of th dark, gracful girl who lovd anothr.
Rostóv noticd somthing nw in Dólokhov’s rlations with Sónya,
but h did not xplain to himslf what ths nw rlations wr.
“Thy’r always in lov with somon,” h thought of Sónya and
Natásha. But h was not as much at as with Sónya and Dólokhov as
bfor and was lss frquntly at hom.
In th autumn of 1806 vrybody had again bgun talking of th war with
Napolon with vn gratr warmth than th yar bfor. Ordrs wr
givn to rais rcruits, tn mn in vry thousand for th rgular army,
and bsids this, nin mn in vry thousand for th militia. vrywhr
Bonapart was anathmatizd and in Moscow nothing but th coming war
was talkd of. For th Rostóv family th whol intrst of ths
prparations for war lay in th fact that Nicholas would not har of
rmaining in Moscow, and only awaitd th trmination of Dnísov’s
furlough aftr Christmas to rturn with him to thir rgimnt. His
approaching dpartur did not prvnt his amusing himslf, but rathr
gav zst to his plasurs. H spnt th gratr part of his tim away
from hom, at dinnrs, partis, and balls.
CHAPTR XI
On th third day aftr Christmas Nicholas dind at hom, a thing h had
rarly don of lat. It was a grand farwll dinnr, as h and Dnísov
wr laving to join thir rgimnt aftr piphany. About twnty popl
wr prsnt, including Dólokhov and Dnísov.
Nvr had lov bn so much in th air, and nvr had th amorous
atmosphr mad itslf so strongly flt in th Rostóvs’ hous as at
this holiday tim. “Siz th momnts of happinss, lov and b lovd!
That is th only rality in th world, all ls is folly. It is th on
thing w ar intrstd in hr,” said th spirit of th plac.
Nicholas, having as usual xhaustd two pairs of horss, without
visiting all th placs h mant to go to and whr h had bn invitd,
rturnd hom just bfor dinnr. As soon as h ntrd h noticd and
flt th tnsion of th amorous air in th hous, and also noticd a
curious mbarrassmnt among som of thos prsnt. Sónya, Dólokhov,
and th old countss wr spcially disturbd, and to a lssr dgr
Natásha. Nicholas undrstood that somthing must hav happnd btwn
Sónya and Dólokhov bfor dinnr, and with th kindly snsitivnss
natural to him was vry gntl and wary with thm both at dinnr. On
that sam vning thr was to b on of th balls that Iogl (th
dancing mastr) gav for his pupils during th holidays.
“Nicholas, will you com to Iogl’s? Plas do!” said Natásha.
“H askd you, and Vasíli Dmítrich * is also going.”
    * Dnísov.
“Whr would I not go at th countss’ command!” said Dnísov,
who at th Rostóvs’ had jocularly assumd th rol of Natásha’s
knight. “I’m vn wady to danc th pas d châl.”
“If I hav tim,” answrd Nicholas. “But I promisd th
Arkhárovs; thy hav a party.”
“And you?” h askd Dólokhov, but as soon as h had askd th
qustion h noticd that it should not hav bn put.
“Prhaps,” coldly and angrily rplid Dólokhov, glancing at Sónya,
and, scowling, h gav Nicholas just such a look as h had givn Pirr
at th club dinnr.
“Thr is somthing up,” thought Nicholas, and h was furthr
confirmd in this conclusion by th fact that Dólokhov lft immdiatly
aftr dinnr. H calld Natásha and askd hr what was th mattr.
“And I was looking for you,” said Natásha running out to him. “I
told you, but you would not bliv it,” sh said triumphantly. “H
has proposd to Sónya!”
Littl as Nicholas had occupid himslf with Sónya of lat, somthing
smd to giv way within him at this nws. Dólokhov was a suitabl and
in som rspcts a brilliant match for th dowrlss, orphan girl. From
th point of viw of th old countss and of socity it was out of th
qustion for hr to rfus him. And thrfor Nicholas’ first fling
on haring th nws was on of angr with Sónya.... H trid to say,
“That’s capital; of cours sh’ll forgt hr childish promiss
and accpt th offr,” but bfor h had tim to say it Natásha bgan
again.
“And fancy! sh rfusd him quit dfinitly!” adding, aftr a
paus, “sh told him sh lovd anothr.”
“Ys, my Sónya could not hav don othrwis!” thought Nicholas.
“Much as Mamma prssd hr, sh rfusd, and I know sh won’t chang
onc sh has said...”
“And Mamma prssd hr!” said Nicholas rproachfully.
“Ys,” said Natásha. “Do you know, Nicholas—don’t b
angry—but I know you will not marry hr. I know, havn knows how, but
I know for crtain that you won’t marry hr.”
“Now you don’t know that at all!” said Nicholas. “But I must
talk to hr. What a darling Sónya is!” h addd with a smil.
“Ah, sh is indd a darling! I’ll snd hr to you.”
And Natásha kissd hr brothr and ran away.
A minut latr Sónya cam in with a frightnd, guilty, and scard
look. Nicholas wnt up to hr and kissd hr hand. This was th first
tim sinc his rturn that thy had talkd alon and about thir lov.
“Sophi,” h bgan, timidly at first and thn mor and mor
boldly, “if you wish to rfus on who is not only a brilliant and
advantagous match but a splndid, nobl fllow... h is my frind...”
Sónya intrruptd him.
“I hav alrady rfusd,” sh said hurridly.
“If you ar rfusing for my sak, I am afraid that I...”
Sónya again intrruptd. Sh gav him an imploring, frightnd look.
“Nicholas, don’t tll m that!” sh said.
“No, but I must. It may b arrogant of m, but still it is bst to say
it. If you rfus him on my account, I must tll you th whol truth. I
lov you, and I think I lov you mor than anyon ls....”
“That is nough for m,” said Sónya, blushing.
“No, but I hav bn in lov a thousand tims and shall fall in
lov again, though for no on hav I such a fling of frindship,
confidnc, and lov as I hav for you. Thn I am young. Mamma dos
not wish it. In a word, I mak no promis. And I bg you to considr
Dólokhov’s offr,” h said, articulating his frind’s nam with
difficulty.
“Don’t say that to m! I want nothing. I lov you as a brothr and
always shall, and I want nothing mor.”
“You ar an angl: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of
mislading you.”
And Nicholas again kissd hr hand.
CHAPTR XII
Iogl’s wr th most njoyabl balls in Moscow. So said th mothrs
as thy watchd thir young popl xcuting thir nwly larnd stps,
and so said th youths and maidns thmslvs as thy dancd till thy
wr rady to drop, and so said th grown-up young mn and womn who
cam to ths balls with an air of condscnsion and found thm most
njoyabl. That yar two marriags had com of ths balls. Th two
prtty young Princsss Gorchakóv mt suitors thr and wr marrid
and so furthr incrasd th fam of ths dancs. What distinguishd
thm from othrs was th absnc of host or hostss and th prsnc of
th good-naturd Iogl, flying about lik a fathr and bowing according
to th ruls of his art, as h collctd th tickts from all his
visitors. Thr was th fact that only thos cam who wishd to danc
and amus thmslvs as girls of thirtn and fourtn do who ar
waring long drsss for th first tim. With scarcly any xcptions
thy all wr, or smd to b, prtty—so rapturous wr thir smils
and so sparkling thir ys. Somtims th bst of th pupils, of whom
Natásha, who was xcptionally gracful, was first, vn dancd th pas
d châl, but at this last ball only th cossais, th anglais, and
th mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, wr dancd. Iogl had
takn a ballroom in Bzúkhov’s hous, and th ball, as vryon said,
was a grat succss. Thr wr many prtty girls and th Rostóv girls
wr among th prttist. Thy wr both particularly happy and gay.
That vning, proud of Dólokhov’s proposal, hr rfusal, and hr
xplanation with Nicholas, Sónya twirld about bfor sh lft hom
so that th maid could hardly gt hr hair plaitd, and sh was
transparntly radiant with impulsiv joy.
Natásha no lss proud of hr first long drss and of bing at a ral
ball was vn happir. Thy wr both drssd in whit muslin with pink
ribbons.
Natásha fll in lov th vry momnt sh ntrd th ballroom. Sh
was not in lov with anyon in particular, but with vryon. Whatvr
prson sh happnd to look at sh was in lov with for that momnt.
“Oh, how dlightful it is!” sh kpt saying, running up to Sónya.
Nicholas and Dnísov wr walking up and down, looking with kindly
patronag at th dancrs.
“How swt sh is—sh will b a wal bauty!” said Dnísov.
“Who?”
“Countss Natásha,” answrd Dnísov.
“And how sh dancs! What gwac!” h said again aftr a paus.
“Who ar you talking about?”
“About your sistr,” jaculatd Dnísov tstily.
Rostóv smild.
“My dar count, you wr on of my bst pupils—you must danc,”
said littl Iogl coming up to Nicholas. “Look how many charming young
ladis—” H turnd with th sam rqust to Dnísov who was also a
formr pupil of his.
“No, my dar fllow, I’ll b a wallflowr,” said Dnísov.
“Don’t you wcollct what bad us I mad of your lssons?”
“Oh no!” said Iogl, hastning to rassur him. “You wr only
inattntiv, but you had talnt—oh ys, you had talnt!”
Th band struck up th nwly introducd mazurka. Nicholas could not
rfus Iogl and askd Sónya to danc. Dnísov sat down by th old
ladis and, laning on his sabr and bating tim with his foot, told
thm somthing funny and kpt thm amusd, whil h watchd th young
popl dancing, Iogl with Natásha, his prid and his bst pupil, wr
th first coupl. Noislssly, skillfully stpping with his littl
ft in low shos, Iogl flw first across th hall with Natásha, who,
though shy, wnt on carfully xcuting hr stps. Dnísov did not
tak his ys off hr and bat tim with his sabr in a way that clarly
indicatd that if h was not dancing it was bcaus h would not and not
bcaus h could not. In th middl of a figur h bckond to Rostóv
who was passing:
“This is not at all th thing,” h said. “What sort of Polish
mazuwka is this? But sh dos danc splndidly.”
Knowing that Dnísov had a rputation vn in Poland for th mastrly
way in which h dancd th mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Natásha:
“Go and choos Dnísov. H is a ral dancr, a wondr!” h said.
Whn it cam to Natásha’s turn to choos a partnr, sh ros and,
tripping rapidly across in hr littl shos trimmd with bows, ran
timidly to th cornr whr Dnísov sat. Sh saw that vrybody was
looking at hr and waiting. Nicholas saw that Dnísov was rfusing
though h smild dlightdly. H ran up to thm.
“Plas, Vasíli Dmítrich,” Natásha was saying, “do com!”
“Oh no, lt m off, Countss,” Dnísov rplid.
“Now thn, Váska,” said Nicholas.
“Thy coax m as if I wr Váska th cat!” said Dnísov jokingly.
“I’ll sing for you a whol vning,” said Natásha.
“Oh, th faiwy! Sh can do anything with m!” said Dnísov, and
h unhookd his sabr. H cam out from bhind th chairs, claspd his
partnr’s hand firmly, thrw back his had, and advancd his foot,
waiting for th bat. Only on hors back and in th mazurka was
Dnísov’s short statur not noticabl and h lookd th fin fllow
h flt himslf to b. At th right bat of th music h lookd sidways
at his partnr with a mrry and triumphant air, suddnly stampd with
on foot, boundd from th floor lik a ball, and flw round th room
taking his partnr with him. H glidd silntly on on foot half across
th room, and sming not to notic th chairs was dashing straight at
thm, whn suddnly, clinking his spurs and sprading out his lgs,
h stoppd short on his hls, stood so a scond, stampd on th spot
clanking his spurs, whirld rapidly round, and, striking his lft hl
against his right, flw round again in a circl. Natásha gussd what
h mant to do, and abandoning hrslf to him followd his lad hardly
knowing how. First h spun hr round, holding hr now with his lft, now
with his right hand, thn falling on on kn h twirld hr round him,
and again jumping up, dashd so imptuously forward that it smd as if
h would rush through th whol suit of rooms without drawing brath,
and thn h suddnly stoppd and prformd som nw and unxpctd
stps. Whn at last, smartly whirling his partnr round in front of hr
chair, h drw up with a click of his spurs and bowd to hr, Natásha
did not vn mak him a curtsy. Sh fixd hr ys on him in amazmnt,
smiling as if sh did not rcogniz him.
“What dos this man?” sh brought out.
Although Iogl did not acknowldg this to b th ral mazurka, vryon
was dlightd with Dnísov’s skill, h was askd again and again as
a partnr, and th old mn bgan smilingly to talk about Poland and th
good old days. Dnísov, flushd aftr th mazurka and mopping himslf
with his handkrchif, sat down by Natásha and did not lav hr for
th rst of th vning.
CHAPTR XIII
For two days aftr that Rostóv did not s Dólokhov at his own or at
Dólokhov’s hom: on th third day h rcivd a not from him:
As I do not intnd to b at your hous again for rasons you know
of, and am going to rjoin my rgimnt, I am giving a farwll suppr
tonight to my frinds—com to th nglish Hotl.
About tn o’clock Rostóv wnt to th nglish Hotl straight from th
thatr, whr h had bn with his family and Dnísov. H was at onc
shown to th bst room, which Dólokhov had takn for that vning. Som
twnty mn wr gathrd round a tabl at which Dólokhov sat btwn
two candls. On th tabl was a pil of gold and papr mony, and h
was kping th bank. Rostóv had not sn him sinc his proposal and
Sónya’s rfusal and flt uncomfortabl at th thought of how thy
would mt.
Dólokhov’s clar, cold glanc mt Rostóv as soon as h ntrd th
door, as though h had long xpctd him.
“It’s a long tim sinc w mt,” h said. “Thanks for coming.
I’ll just finish daling, and thn Ilyúshka will com with his
chorus.”
“I calld onc or twic at your hous,” said Rostóv, rddning.
Dólokhov mad no rply.
“You may punt,” h said.
Rostóv rcalld at that momnt a strang convrsation h had onc had
with Dólokhov. “Non but fools trust to luck in play,” Dólokhov
had thn said.
“Or ar you afraid to play with m?” Dólokhov now askd as if
gussing Rostóv’s thought.
Bnath his smil Rostóv saw in him th mood h had shown at th club
dinnr and at othr tims, whn as if tird of vryday lif h had flt
a nd to scap from it by som strang, and usually crul, action.
Rostóv flt ill at as. H trid, but faild, to find som jok with
which to rply to Dólokhov’s words. But bfor h had thought of
anything, Dólokhov, looking straight in his fac, said slowly and
dlibratly so that vryon could har:
“Do you rmmbr w had a talk about cards... ‘H’s a fool who
trusts to luck, on should mak crtain,’ and I want to try.”
“To try his luck or th crtainty?” Rostóv askd himslf.
“Wll, you’d bttr not play,” Dólokhov addd, and springing a
nw pack of cards said: “Bank, gntlmn!”
Moving th mony forward h prpard to dal. Rostóv sat down by his
sid and at first did not play. Dólokhov kpt glancing at him.
“Why don’t you play?” h askd.
And strang to say Nicholas flt that h could not hlp taking up a
card, putting a small stak on it, and bginning to play.
“I hav no mony with m,” h said.
“I’ll trust you.”
Rostóv stakd fiv rubls on a card and lost, stakd again, and again
lost. Dólokhov “killd,” that is, bat, tn cards of Rostóv’s
running.
“Gntlmn,” said Dólokhov aftr h had dalt for som tim.
“Plas plac your mony on th cards or I may gt muddld in th
rckoning.”
On of th playrs said h hopd h might b trustd.
“Ys, you might, but I am afraid of gtting th accounts mixd. So I
ask you to put th mony on your cards,” rplid Dólokhov. “Don’t
stint yourslf, w’ll sttl aftrwards,” h addd, turning to
Rostóv.
Th gam continud; a waitr kpt handing round champagn.
All Rostóv’s cards wr batn and h had ight hundrd rubls scord
up against him. H wrot “800 rubls” on a card, but whil th
waitr filld his glass h changd his mind and altrd it to his usual
stak of twnty rubls.
“Lav it,” said Dólokhov, though h did not sm to b vn
looking at Rostóv, “you’ll win it back all th soonr. I los to
th othrs but win from you. Or ar you afraid of m?” h askd again.
Rostóv submittd. H lt th ight hundrd rmain and laid down a svn
of harts with a torn cornr, which h had pickd up from th floor. H
wll rmmbrd that svn aftrwards. H laid down th svn of harts,
on which with a brokn bit of chalk h had writtn “800 rubls” in
clar upright figurs; h mptid th glass of warm champagn that was
handd him, smild at Dólokhov’s words, and with a sinking hart,
waiting for a svn to turn up, gazd at Dólokhov’s hands which hld
th pack. Much dpndd on Rostóv’s winning or losing on that svn
of harts. On th prvious Sunday th old count had givn his son
two thousand rubls, and though h always dislikd spaking of mony
difficultis had told Nicholas that this was all h could lt him hav
till May, and askd him to b mor conomical this tim. Nicholas had
rplid that it would b mor than nough for him and that h gav his
word of honor not to tak anything mor till th spring. Now only twlv
hundrd rubls was lft of that mony, so that this svn of harts
mant for him not only th loss of sixtn hundrd rubls, but th
ncssity of going back on his word. With a sinking hart h watchd
Dólokhov’s hands and thought, “Now thn, mak hast and lt m hav
this card and I’ll tak my cap and driv hom to suppr with Dnísov,
Natásha, and Sónya, and will crtainly nvr touch a card again.” At
that momnt his hom lif, joks with Ptya, talks with Sónya, duts
with Natásha, piqut with his fathr, and vn his comfortabl bd
in th hous on th Povarskáya ros bfor him with such vividnss,
clarnss, and charm that it smd as if it wr all a lost and
unapprciatd bliss, long past. H could not conciv that a stupid
chanc, ltting th svn b dalt to th right rathr than to th lft,
might dpriv him of all this happinss, nwly apprciatd and nwly
illumind, and plung him into th dpths of unknown and undfind
misry. That could not b, yt h awaitd with a sinking hart th
movmnt of Dólokhov’s hands. Thos broad, rddish hands, with hairy
wrists visibl from undr th shirt cuffs, laid down th pack and took
up a glass and a pip that wr handd him.
“So you ar not afraid to play with m?” rpatd Dólokhov, and as
if about to tll a good story h put down th cards, land back in his
chair, and bgan dlibratly with a smil:
“Ys, gntlmn, I’v bn told thr’s a rumor going about Moscow
that I’m a sharpr, so I advis you to b carful.”
“Com now, dal!” xclaimd Rostóv.
“Oh, thos Moscow gossips!” said Dólokhov, and h took up th cards
with a smil.
“Aah!” Rostóv almost scramd lifting both hands to his had. Th
svn h ndd was lying upprmost, th first card in th pack. H had
lost mor than h could pay.
“Still, don’t ruin yourslf!” said Dólokhov with a sid glanc at
Rostóv as h continud to dal.
CHAPTR XIV
An hour and a half latr most of th playrs wr but littl intrstd
in thir own play.
Th whol intrst was concntratd on Rostóv. Instad of sixtn
hundrd rubls h had a long column of figurs scord against him,
which h had rckond up to tn thousand, but that now, as h vaguly
supposd, must hav risn to fiftn thousand. In rality it alrady
xcdd twnty thousand rubls. Dólokhov was no longr listning to
storis or tlling thm, but followd vry movmnt of Rostóv’s
hands and occasionally ran his ys ovr th scor against him. H had
dcidd to play until that scor rachd forty-thr thousand. H
had fixd on that numbr bcaus forty-thr was th sum of his and
Sónya’s joint ags. Rostóv, laning his had on both hands, sat at
th tabl which was scrawld ovr with figurs, wt with spilld win,
and littrd with cards. On tormnting imprssion did not lav him:
that thos broad-bond rddish hands with hairy wrists visibl from
undr th shirt slvs, thos hands which h lovd and hatd, hld him
in thir powr.
“Six hundrd rubls, ac, a cornr, a nin... winning it back’s
impossibl... Oh, how plasant it was at hom!... Th knav, doubl or
quits... it can’t b!... And why is h doing this to m?” Rostóv
pondrd. Somtims h stakd a larg sum, but Dólokhov rfusd to
accpt it and fixd th stak himslf. Nicholas submittd to him, and at
on momnt prayd to God as h had don on th battlfild at th bridg
ovr th nns, and thn gussd that th card that cam first to hand
from th crumpld hap undr th tabl would sav him, now countd th
cords on his coat and took a card with that numbr and trid staking th
total of his losss on it, thn h lookd round for aid from th othr
playrs, or prd at th now cold fac of Dólokhov and trid to rad
what was passing in his mind.
“H knows of cours what this loss mans to m. H can’t want my
ruin. Wasn’t h my frind? Wasn’t I fond of him? But it’s not his
fault. What’s h to do if h has such luck?... And it’s not my fault
ithr,” h thought to himslf, “I hav don nothing wrong. Hav I
killd anyon, or insultd or wishd harm to anyon? Why such a trribl
misfortun? And whn did it bgin? Such a littl whil ago I cam to
this tabl with th thought of winning a hundrd rubls to buy that
caskt for Mamma’s nam day and thn going hom. I was so happy, so
fr, so lighthartd! And I did not raliz how happy I was! Whn did
that nd and whn did this nw, trribl stat of things bgin? What
markd th chang? I sat all th tim in this sam plac at this tabl,
chos and placd cards, and watchd thos broad-bond agil hands in th
sam way. Whn did it happn and what has happnd? I am wll and strong
and still th sam and in th sam plac. No, it can’t b! Surly it
will all nd in nothing!”
H was flushd and bathd in prspiration, though th room was not hot.
His fac was trribl and pitous to s, spcially from its hlplss
fforts to sm calm.
Th scor against him rachd th fatful sum of forty-thr thousand.
Rostóv had just prpard a card, by bnding th cornr of which h
mant to doubl th thr thousand just put down to his scor, whn
Dólokhov, slamming down th pack of cards, put it asid and bgan
rapidly adding up th total of Rostóv’s dbt, braking th chalk as
h markd th figurs in his clar, bold hand.
“Suppr, it’s tim for suppr! And hr ar th gypsis!”
Som swarthy mn and womn wr rally ntring from th cold outsid
and saying somthing in thir gypsy accnts. Nicholas undrstood that it
was all ovr; but h said in an indiffrnt ton:
“Wll, won’t you go on? I had a splndid card all rady,” as if it
wr th fun of th gam which intrstd him most.
“It’s all up! I’m lost!” thought h. “Now a bullt through my
brain—that’s all that’s lft m!” And at th sam tim h said
in a chrful voic:
“Com now, just this on mor littl card!”
“All right!” said Dólokhov, having finishd th addition. “All
right! Twnty-on rubls,” h said, pointing to th figur twnty-on
by which th total xcdd th round sum of forty-thr thousand; and
taking up a pack h prpard to dal. Rostóv submissivly unbnt th
cornr of his card and, instad of th six thousand h had intndd,
carfully wrot twnty-on.
“It’s all th sam to m,” h said. “I only want to s whthr
you will lt m win this tn, or bat it.”
Dólokhov bgan to dal sriously. Oh, how Rostóv dtstd at that
momnt thos hands with thir short rddish fingrs and hairy wrists,
which hld him in thir powr.... Th tn fll to him.
“You ow forty-thr thousand, Count,” said Dólokhov, and
strtching himslf h ros from th tabl. “On dos gt tird sitting
so long,” h addd.
“Ys, I’m tird too,” said Rostóv.
Dólokhov cut him short, as if to rmind him that it was not for him to
jst.
“Whn am I to rciv th mony, Count?”
Rostóv, flushing, drw Dólokhov into th nxt room.
“I cannot pay it all immdiatly. Will you tak an I.O.U.?” h said.
“I say, Rostóv,” said Dólokhov clarly, smiling and looking
Nicholas straight in th ys, “you know th saying, ‘Lucky in lov,
unlucky at cards.’ Your cousin is in lov with you, I know.”
“Oh, it’s trribl to fl onslf so in this man’s powr,”
thought Rostóv. H knw what a shock h would inflict on his fathr and
mothr by th nws of this loss, h knw what a rlif it would b to
scap it all, and flt that Dólokhov knw that h could sav him from
all this sham and sorrow, but wantd now to play with him as a cat dos
with a mous.
“Your cousin...” Dólokhov startd to say, but Nicholas intrruptd
him.
“My cousin has nothing to do with this and it’s not ncssary to
mntion hr!” h xclaimd fircly.
“Thn whn am I to hav it?”
“Tomorrow,” rplid Rostóv and lft th room.
CHAPTR XV
To say “tomorrow” and kp up a dignifid ton was not difficult,
but to go hom alon, s his sistrs, brothr, mothr, and fathr,
confss and ask for mony h had no right to aftr giving his word of
honor, was trribl.
At hom, thy had not yt gon to bd. Th young popl, aftr rturning
from th thatr, had had suppr and wr groupd round th clavichord.
As soon as Nicholas ntrd, h was nfoldd in that potic atmosphr
of lov which prvadd th Rostóv houshold that wintr and, now aftr
Dólokhov’s proposal and Iogl’s ball, smd to hav grown thickr
round Sónya and Natásha as th air dos bfor a thundrstorm. Sónya
and Natásha, in th light-blu drsss thy had worn at th thatr,
looking prtty and conscious of it, wr standing by th clavichord,
happy and smiling. Vra was playing chss with Shinshín in th drawing
room. Th old countss, waiting for th rturn of hr husband and son,
sat playing patinc with th old gntlwoman who livd in thir hous.
Dnísov, with sparkling ys and ruffld hair, sat at th clavichord
striking chords with his short fingrs, his lgs thrown back and his
ys rolling as h sang, with his small, husky, but tru voic, som
vrss calld “nchantrss,” which h had composd, and to which h
was trying to fit music:
   nchantrss, say, to my forsakn lyr
   What magic powr is this rcalls m still?
   What spark has st my inmost soul on fir,
   What is this bliss that maks my fingrs thrill?
H was singing in passionat tons, gazing with his sparkling
black-agat ys at th frightnd and happy Natásha.
“Splndid! xcllnt!” xclaimd Natásha. “Anothr vrs,” sh
said, without noticing Nicholas.
“vrything’s still th sam with thm,” thought Nicholas,
glancing into th drawing room, whr h saw Vra and his mothr with
th old lady.
“Ah, and hr’s Nicholas!” crid Natásha, running up to him.
“Is Papa at hom?” h askd.
“I am so glad you’v com!” said Natásha, without answring him.
“W ar njoying ourslvs! Vasíli Dmítrich is staying a day longr
for my sak! Did you know?”
“No, Papa is not back yt,” said Sónya.
“Nicholas, hav you com? Com hr, dar!” calld th old countss
from th drawing room.
Nicholas wnt to hr, kissd hr hand, and sitting down silntly at hr
tabl bgan to watch hr hands arranging th cards. From th dancing
room, thy still hard th laughtr and mrry voics trying to prsuad
Natásha to sing.
“All wight! All wight!” shoutd Dnísov. “It’s no good making
xcuss now! It’s your turn to sing th ba’cawolla—I ntwat
you!”
Th countss glancd at hr silnt son.
“What is th mattr?” sh askd.
“Oh, nothing,” said h, as if wary of bing continually askd th
sam qustion. “Will Papa b back soon?”
“I xpct so.”
“vrything’s th sam with thm. Thy know nothing about it! Whr
am I to go?” thought Nicholas, and wnt again into th dancing room
whr th clavichord stood.
Sónya was sitting at th clavichord, playing th prlud to
Dnísov’s favorit barcaroll. Natásha was prparing to sing.
Dnísov was looking at hr with nrapturd ys.
Nicholas bgan pacing up and down th room.
“Why do thy want to mak hr sing? How can sh sing? Thr’s
nothing to b happy about!” thought h.
Sónya struck th first chord of th prlud.
“My God, I’m a ruind and dishonord man! A bullt through my brain
is th only thing lft m—not singing!” his thoughts ran on. “Go
away? But whr to? It’s on—lt thm sing!”
H continud to pac th room, looking gloomily at Dnísov and th
girls and avoiding thir ys.
“Nikólnka, what is th mattr?” Sónya’s ys fixd on him
smd to ask. Sh noticd at onc that somthing had happnd to him.
Nicholas turnd away from hr. Natásha too, with hr quick instinct,
had instantly noticd hr brothr’s condition. But, though sh noticd
it, sh was hrslf in such high spirits at that momnt, so far from
sorrow, sadnss, or slf-rproach, that sh purposly dcivd hrslf
as young popl oftn do. “No, I am too happy now to spoil my
njoymnt by sympathy with anyon’s sorrow,” sh flt, and sh said
to hrslf: “No, I must b mistakn, h must b fling happy, just as
I am.”
“Now, Sónya!” sh said, going to th vry middl of th room, whr
sh considrd th rsonanc was bst.
Having liftd hr had and lt hr arms droop liflssly, as ballt
dancrs do, Natásha, rising nrgtically from hr hls to hr tos,
stppd to th middl of th room and stood still.
“Ys, that’s m!” sh smd to say, answring th rapt gaz with
which Dnísov followd hr.
“And what is sh so plasd about?” thought Nicholas, looking at his
sistr. “Why isn’t sh dull and ashamd?”
Natásha took th first not, hr throat swlld, hr chst ros,
hr ys bcam srious. At that momnt sh was oblivious of hr
surroundings, and from hr smiling lips flowd sounds which anyon may
produc at th sam intrvals and hold for th sam tim, but which
lav you cold a thousand tims and th thousand and first tim thrill
you and mak you wp.
Natásha, that wintr, had for th first tim bgun to sing sriously,
mainly bcaus Dnísov so dlightd in hr singing. Sh no longr sang
as a child, thr was no longr in hr singing that comical, childish,
painstaking ffct that had bn in it bfor; but sh did not yt sing
wll, as all th connoissurs who hard hr said: “It is not traind,
but it is a bautiful voic that must b traind.” Only thy gnrally
said this som tim aftr sh had finishd singing. Whil that untraind
voic, with its incorrct brathing and labord transitions, was
sounding, vn th connoissurs said nothing, but only dlightd in
it and wishd to har it again. In hr voic thr was a virginal
frshnss, an unconsciousnss of hr own powrs, and an as yt untraind
vlvty softnss, which so mingld with hr lack of art in singing that
it smd as if nothing in that voic could b altrd without spoiling
it.
“What is this?” thought Nicholas, listning to hr with widly
opnd ys. “What has happnd to hr? How sh is singing today!”
And suddnly th whol world cntrd for him on anticipation of th
nxt not, th nxt phras, and vrything in th world was dividd into
thr bats: “Oh mio crudl afftto.”... On, two, thr... on,
two, thr... On... “Oh mio crudl afftto.”... On, two, thr...
On. “Oh, this snslss lif of ours!” thought Nicholas. “All
this misry, and mony, and Dólokhov, and angr, and honor—it’s all
nonsns... but this is ral.... Now thn, Natásha, now thn, darst!
Now thn, darling! How will sh tak that si? Sh’s takn it! Thank
God!” And without noticing that h was singing, to strngthn th si
h sung a scond, a third blow th high not. “Ah, God! How fin! Did
I rally tak it? How fortunat!” h thought.
Oh, how that chord vibratd, and how movd was somthing that was finst
in Rostóv’s soul! And this somthing was apart from vrything ls
in th world and abov vrything in th world. “What wr losss, and
Dólokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsns! On might kill and rob
and yt b happy....”
CHAPTR XVI
It was long sinc Rostóv had flt such njoymnt from music as h
did that day. But no soonr had Natásha finishd hr barcaroll than
rality again prsntd itslf. H got up without saying a word and wnt
downstairs to his own room. A quartr of an hour latr th old count
cam in from his club, chrful and contntd. Nicholas, haring him
driv up, wnt to mt him.
“Wll—had a good tim?” said th old count, smiling gaily and
proudly at his son.
Nicholas trid to say “Ys,” but could not: and h narly burst into
sobs. Th count was lighting his pip and did not notic his son’s
condition.
“Ah, it can’t b avoidd!” thought Nicholas, for th first and
last tim. And suddnly, in th most casual ton, which mad him fl
ashamd of himslf, h said, as if mrly asking his fathr to lt him
hav th carriag to driv to town:
“Papa, I hav com on a mattr of businss. I was narly forgtting. I
nd som mony.”
“Dar m!” said his fathr, who was in a spcially good humor. “I
told you it would not b nough. How much?”
“Vry much,” said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid carlss
smil, for which h was long unabl to forgiv himslf, “I hav lost a
littl, I man a good dal, a grat dal—forty thr thousand.”
“What! To whom?... Nonsns!” crid th count, suddnly rddning
with an apoplctic flush ovr nck and nap as old popl do.
“I promisd to pay tomorrow,” said Nicholas.
“Wll!...” said th old count, sprading out his arms and sinking
hlplssly on th sofa.
“It can’t b hlpd! It happns to vryon!” said th son, with
a bold, fr, and asy ton, whil in his soul h rgardd himslf as a
worthlss scoundrl whos whol lif could not aton for his crim. H
longd to kiss his fathr’s hands and knl to bg his forgivnss,
but said, in a carlss and vn rud voic, that it happns to
vryon!
Th old count cast down his ys on haring his son’s words and bgan
bustlingly sarching for somthing.
“Ys, ys,” h muttrd, “it will b difficult, I far, difficult
to rais... happns to vrybody! Ys, who has not don it?”
And with a furtiv glanc at his son’s fac, th count wnt out of th
room.... Nicholas had bn prpard for rsistanc, but had not at all
xpctd this.
“Papa! Pa-pa!” h calld aftr him, sobbing, “forgiv m!” And
sizing his fathr’s hand, h prssd it to his lips and burst into
tars.
Whil fathr and son wr having thir xplanation, th mothr and
daughtr wr having on not lss important. Natásha cam running to
hr mothr, quit xcitd.
“Mamma!... Mamma!... H has mad m...”
“Mad what?”
“Mad, mad m an offr, Mamma! Mamma!” sh xclaimd.
Th countss did not bliv hr ars. Dnísov had proposd. To whom?
To this chit of a girl, Natásha, who not so long ago was playing with
dolls and who was still having lssons.
“Don’t, Natásha! What nonsns!” sh said, hoping it was a jok.
“Nonsns, indd! I am tlling you th fact,” said Natásha
indignantly. “I com to ask you what to do, and you call it
‘nonsns!’”
Th countss shruggd hr shouldrs.
“If it is tru that Monsiur Dnísov has mad you a proposal, tll
him h is a fool, that’s all!”
“No, h’s not a fool!” rplid Natásha indignantly and sriously.
“Wll thn, what do you want? You’r all in lov nowadays. Wll,
if you ar in lov, marry him!” said th countss, with a laugh of
annoyanc. “Good luck to you!”
“No, Mamma, I’m not in lov with him, I suppos I’m not in lov
with him.”
“Wll thn, tll him so.”
“Mamma, ar you cross? Don’t b cross, dar! Is it my fault?”
“No, but what is it, my dar? Do you want m to go and tll him?”
said th countss smiling.
“No, I will do it myslf, only tll m what to say. It’s all vry
wll for you,” said Natásha, with a rsponsiv smil. “You should
hav sn how h said it! I know h did not man to say it, but it cam
out accidntly.”
“Wll, all th sam, you must rfus him.”
“No, I mustn’t. I am so sorry for him! H’s so nic.”
“Wll thn, accpt his offr. It’s high tim for you to b
marrid,” answrd th countss sharply and sarcastically.
“No, Mamma, but I’m so sorry for him. I don’t know how I’m to
say it.”
“And thr’s nothing for you to say. I shall spak to him myslf,”
said th countss, indignant that thy should hav dard to trat this
littl Natásha as grown up.
“No, not on any account! I will tll him myslf, and you’ll listn
at th door,” and Natásha ran across th drawing room to th dancing
hall, whr Dnísov was sitting on th sam chair by th clavichord
with his fac in his hands.
H jumpd up at th sound of hr light stp.
“Nataly,” h said, moving with rapid stps toward hr, “dcid my
fat. It is in your hands.”
“Vasíli Dmítrich, I’m so sorry for you!... No, but you ar so
nic... but it won’t do...not that... but as a frind, I shall always
lov you.”
Dnísov bnt ovr hr hand and sh hard strang sounds sh did not
undrstand. Sh kissd his rough curly black had. At this instant, thy
hard th quick rustl of th countss’ drss. Sh cam up to thm.
“Vasíli Dmítrich, I thank you for th honor,” sh said, with an
mbarrassd voic, though it soundd svr to Dnísov—“but my
daughtr is so young, and I thought that, as my son’s frind, you
would hav addrssd yourslf first to m. In that cas you would not
hav obligd m to giv this rfusal.”
“Countss...” said Dnísov, with downcast ys and a guilty fac.
H trid to say mor, but faltrd.
Natásha could not rmain calm, sing him in such a plight. Sh bgan
to sob aloud.
“Countss, I hav don w’ong,” Dnísov wnt on in an unstady
voic, “but bliv m, I so ador your daughtr and all your family
that I would giv my lif twic ovr...” H lookd at th countss,
and sing hr svr fac said: “Wll, good-by, Countss,” and
kissing hr hand, h lft th room with quick rsolut strids, without
looking at Natásha.
Nxt day Rostóv saw Dnísov off. H did not wish to stay anothr
day in Moscow. All Dnísov’s Moscow frinds gav him a farwll
ntrtainmnt at th gypsis’, with th rsult that h had no
rcollction of how h was put in th sligh or of th first thr
stags of his journy.
Aftr Dnísov’s dpartur, Rostóv spnt anothr fortnight in Moscow,
without going out of th hous, waiting for th mony his fathr could
not at onc rais, and h spnt most of his tim in th girls’ room.
Sónya was mor tndr and dvotd to him than vr. It was as if sh
wantd to show him that his losss wr an achivmnt that mad hr
lov him all th mor, but Nicholas now considrd himslf unworthy of
hr.
H filld th girls’ albums with vrss and music, and having at last
snt Dólokhov th whol forty-thr thousand rubls and rcivd his
rcipt, h lft at th nd of Novmbr, without taking lav of any of
his acquaintancs, to ovrtak his rgimnt which was alrady in Poland.
BOOK FIV: 1806 - 07
CHAPTR I
Aftr his intrviw with his wif Pirr lft for Ptrsburg. At th
Torzhók post station, ithr thr wr no horss or th postmastr
would not supply thm. Pirr was obligd to wait. Without undrssing,
h lay down on th lathr sofa in front of a round tabl, put his big
ft in thir ovrboots on th tabl, and bgan to rflct.
“Will you hav th portmantaus brought in? And a bd got rady, and
ta?” askd his valt.
Pirr gav no answr, for h nithr hard nor saw anything. H had
bgun to think of th last station and was still pondring on th sam
qustion—on so important that h took no notic of what wnt
on around him. Not only was h indiffrnt as to whthr h got to
Ptrsburg arlir or latr, or whthr h scurd accommodation at this
station, but compard to th thoughts that now occupid him it was a
mattr of indiffrnc whthr h rmaind thr for a fw hours or for
th rst of his lif.
Th postmastr, his wif, th valt, and a pasant woman slling
Torzhók mbroidry cam into th room offring thir srvics.
Without changing his carlss attitud, Pirr lookd at thm ovr his
spctacls unabl to undrstand what thy wantd or how thy could go on
living without having solvd th problms that so absorbd him. H had
bn ngrossd by th sam thoughts vr sinc th day h rturnd from
Sokólniki aftr th dul and had spnt that first agonizing, slplss
night. But now, in th solitud of th journy, thy sizd him with
spcial forc. No mattr what h thought about, h always rturnd to
ths sam qustions which h could not solv and yt could not cas to
ask himslf. It was as if th thrad of th chif scrw which hld his
lif togthr wr strippd, so that th scrw could not gt in or out,
but wnt on turning uslssly in th sam plac.
Th postmastr cam in and bgan obsquiously to bg his xcllncy to
wait only two hours, whn, com what might, h would lt his xcllncy
hav th courir horss. It was plain that h was lying and only wantd
to gt mor mony from th travlr.
“Is this good or bad?” Pirr askd himslf. “It is good for m,
bad for anothr travlr, and for himslf it’s unavoidabl, bcaus
h nds mony for food; th man said an officr had onc givn him a
thrashing for ltting a privat travlr hav th courir horss.
But th officr thrashd him bcaus h had to gt on as quickly as
possibl. And I,” continud Pirr, “shot Dólokhov bcaus I
considrd myslf injurd, and Louis XVI was xcutd bcaus thy
considrd him a criminal, and a yar latr thy xcutd thos who
xcutd him—also for som rason. What is bad? What is good? What
should on lov and what hat? What dos on liv for? And what am I?
What is lif, and what is dath? What powr govrns all?”
Thr was no answr to any of ths qustions, xcpt on, and that
not a logical answr and not at all a rply to thm. Th answr was:
“You’ll di and all will nd. You’ll di and know all, or cas
asking.” But dying was also dradful.
Th Torzhók pddlr woman, in a whining voic, wnt on offring hr
wars, spcially a pair of goatskin slipprs. “I hav hundrds of
rubls I don’t know what to do with, and sh stands in hr tattrd
cloak looking timidly at m,” h thought. “And what dos sh
want th mony for? As if that mony could add a hair’s bradth to
happinss or pac of mind. Can anything in th world mak hr or m
lss a pry to vil and dath?—dath which nds all and must com
today or tomorrow—at any rat, in an instant as compard with
trnity.” And again h twistd th scrw with th strippd thrad,
and again it turnd uslssly in th sam plac.
His srvant handd him a half-cut novl, in th form of lttrs, by
Madam d Souza. H bgan rading about th suffrings and virtuous
struggls of a crtain mili d Mansfld. “And why did sh rsist
hr sducr whn sh lovd him?” h thought. “God could not hav put
into hr hart an impuls that was against His will. My wif—as sh
onc was—did not struggl, and prhaps sh was right. Nothing has bn
found out, nothing discovrd,” Pirr again said to himslf. “All
w can know is that w know nothing. And that’s th hight of human
wisdom.”
vrything within and around him smd confusd, snslss, and
rpllnt. Yt in this vry rpugnanc to all his circumstancs Pirr
found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.
“I mak bold to ask your xcllncy to mov a littl for this
gntlman,” said th postmastr, ntring th room followd by anothr
travlr, also dtaind for lack of horss.
Th nwcomr was a short, larg-bond, yllow-facd, wrinkld old
man, with gray bushy ybrows ovrhanging bright ys of an indfinit
grayish color.
Pirr took his ft off th tabl, stood up, and lay down on a bd that
had bn got rady for him, glancing now and thn at th nwcomr, who,
with a gloomy and tird fac, was warily taking off his wraps with th
aid of his srvant, and not looking at Pirr. With a pair of flt boots
on his thin bony lgs, and kping on a worn, nankn-covrd, shpskin
coat, th travlr sat down on th sofa, land back his big had with
its broad tmpls and clos-croppd hair, and lookd at Bzúkhov. Th
strn, shrwd, and pntrating xprssion of that look struck Pirr. H
flt a wish to spak to th strangr, but by th tim h had mad up his
mind to ask him a qustion about th roads, th travlr had closd his
ys. His shrivld old hands wr foldd and on th fingr of on of
thm Pirr noticd a larg cast iron ring with a sal rprsnting a
dath’s had. Th strangr sat without stirring, ithr rsting or, as
it smd to Pirr, sunk in profound and calm mditation. His srvant
was also a yllow, wrinkld old man, without bard or mustach,
vidntly not bcaus h was shavn but bcaus thy had nvr grown.
This activ old srvant was unpacking th travlr’s cantn and
prparing ta. H brought in a boiling samovar. Whn vrything was
rady, th strangr opnd his ys, movd to th tabl, filld a
tumblr with ta for himslf and on for th bardlss old man to whom
h passd it. Pirr bgan to fl a sns of unasinss, and th
nd, vn th invitability, of ntring into convrsation with this
strangr.
Th srvant brought back his tumblr turnd upsid down, * with an
unfinishd bit of nibbld sugar, and askd if anything mor would b
wantd.
    * To indicat h did not want mor ta.
“No. Giv m th book,” said th strangr.
Th srvant handd him a book which Pirr took to b a dvotional work,
and th travlr bcam absorbd in it. Pirr lookd at him. All at
onc th strangr closd th book, putting in a markr, and again,
laning with his arms on th back of th sofa, sat in his formr
position with his ys shut. Pirr lookd at him and had not tim
to turn away whn th old man, opning his ys, fixd his stady and
svr gaz straight on Pirr’s fac.
Pirr flt confusd and wishd to avoid that look, but th bright old
ys attractd him irrsistibly.
CHAPTR II
“I hav th plasur of addrssing Count Bzúkhov, if I am not
mistakn,” said th strangr in a dlibrat and loud voic.
Pirr lookd silntly and inquiringly at him ovr his spctacls.
“I hav hard of you, my dar sir,” continud th strangr, “and
of your misfortun.” H smd to mphasiz th last word, as if to
say—“Ys, misfortun! Call it what you plas, I know that what
happnd to you in Moscow was a misfortun.”—“I rgrt it vry
much, my dar sir.”
Pirr flushd and, hurridly putting his lgs down from th bd, bnt
forward toward th old man with a forcd and timid smil.
“I hav not rfrrd to this out of curiosity, my dar sir, but for
gratr rasons.”
H pausd, his gaz still on Pirr, and movd asid on th sofa by way
of inviting th othr to tak a sat bsid him. Pirr flt rluctant
to ntr into convrsation with this old man, but, submitting to him
involuntarily, cam up and sat down bsid him.
“You ar unhappy, my dar sir,” th strangr continud. “You
ar young and I am old. I should lik to hlp you as far as lis in my
powr.”
“Oh, ys!” said Pirr, with a forcd smil. “I am vry gratful
to you. Whr ar you travling from?”
Th strangr’s fac was not gnial, it was vn cold and svr, but
in spit of this, both th fac and words of his nw acquaintanc wr
irrsistibly attractiv to Pirr.
“But if for any rason you don’t fl inclind to talk to m,”
said th old man, “say so, my dar sir.” And h suddnly smild, in
an unxpctd and tndrly patrnal way.
“Oh no, not at all! On th contrary, I am vry glad to mak your
acquaintanc,” said Pirr. And again, glancing at th strangr’s
hands, h lookd mor closly at th ring, with its skull—a Masonic
sign.
“Allow m to ask,” h said, “ar you a Mason?”
“Ys, I blong to th Brothrhood of th Frmasons,” said th
strangr, looking dpr and dpr into Pirr’s ys. “And in
thir nam and my own I hold out a brothrly hand to you.”
“I am afraid,” said Pirr, smiling, and wavring btwn th
confidnc th prsonality of th Frmason inspird in him and his own
habit of ridiculing th Masonic blifs—“I am afraid I am vry far
from undrstanding—how am I to put it?—I am afraid my way of looking
at th world is so opposd to yours that w shall not undrstand on
anothr.”
“I know your outlook,” said th Mason, “and th viw of lif you
mntion, and which you think is th rsult of your own mntal fforts,
is th on hld by th majority of popl, and is th invariabl fruit
of prid, indolnc, and ignoranc. Forgiv m, my dar sir, but if I
had not known it I should not hav addrssd you. Your viw of lif is a
rgrttabl dlusion.”
“Just as I may suppos you to b dludd,” said Pirr, with a faint
smil.
“I should nvr dar to say that I know th truth,” said th Mason,
whos words struck Pirr mor and mor by thir prcision and firmnss.
“No on can attain to truth by himslf. Only by laying ston on ston
with th coopration of all, by th millions of gnrations from our
forfathr Adam to our own tims, is that tmpl rard which is to b
a worthy dwlling plac of th Grat God,” h addd, and closd his
ys.
“I ought to tll you that I do not bliv... do not bliv in
God,” said Pirr, rgrtfully and with an ffort, fling it
ssntial to spak th whol truth.
Th Mason lookd intntly at Pirr and smild as a rich man with
millions in hand might smil at a poor fllow who told him that h, poor
man, had not th fiv rubls that would mak him happy.
“Ys, you do not know Him, my dar sir,” said th Mason. “You
cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you ar unhappy.”
“Ys, ys, I am unhappy,” assntd Pirr. “But what am I to
do?”
“You know Him not, my dar sir, and so you ar vry unhappy. You do
not know Him, but H is hr, H is in m, H is in my words, H is in
th, and vn in thos blasphmous words thou hast just uttrd!”
pronouncd th Mason in a strn and trmulous voic.
H pausd and sighd, vidntly trying to calm himslf.
“If H wr not,” h said quitly, “you and I would not b
spaking of Him, my dar sir. Of what, of whom, ar w spaking? Whom
hast thou dnid?” h suddnly askd with xulting austrity and
authority in his voic. “Who invntd Him, if H did not xist? Whnc
cam thy concption of th xistnc of such an incomprhnsibl Bing?
didst thou, and why did th whol world, conciv th ida of th
xistnc of such an incomprhnsibl Bing, a Bing all-powrful,
trnal, and infinit in all His attributs?...”
H stoppd and rmaind silnt for a long tim.
Pirr could not and did not wish to brak this silnc.
“H xists, but to undrstand Him is hard,” th Mason bgan again,
looking not at Pirr but straight bfor him, and turning th lavs
of his book with his old hands which from xcitmnt h could not kp
still. “If it wr a man whos xistnc thou didst doubt I could
bring him to th, could tak him by th hand and show him to th. But
how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotnc, His infinity,
and all His mrcy to on who is blind, or who shuts his ys that h may
not s or undrstand Him and may not s or undrstand his own vilnss
and sinfulnss?” H pausd again. “Who art thou? Thou dramst that
thou art wis bcaus thou couldst uttr thos blasphmous words,” h
wnt on, with a sombr and scornful smil. “And thou art mor foolish
and unrasonabl than a littl child, who, playing with th parts of a
skillfully mad watch, dars to say that, as h dos not undrstand
its us, h dos not bliv in th mastr who mad it. To know Him is
hard.... For ags, from our forfathr Adam to our own day, w labor to
attain that knowldg and ar still infinitly far from our aim; but
in our lack of undrstanding w s only our waknss and His
gratnss....”
Pirr listnd with swlling hart, gazing into th Mason’s fac with
shining ys, not intrrupting or qustioning him, but bliving with
his whol soul what th strangr said. Whthr h accptd th wis
rasoning containd in th Mason’s words, or blivd as a child
blivs, in th spakr’s ton of conviction and arnstnss, or
th trmor of th spakr’s voic—which somtims almost brok—or
thos brilliant agd ys grown old in this conviction, or th calm
firmnss and crtainty of his vocation, which radiatd from his whol
bing (and which struck Pirr spcially by contrast with his own
djction and hoplssnss)—at any rat, Pirr longd with his whol
soul to bliv and h did bliv, and flt a joyful sns of comfort,
rgnration, and rturn to lif.
“H is not to b apprhndd by rason, but by lif,” said th
Mason.
“I do not undrstand,” said Pirr, fling with dismay doubts
rawakning. H was afraid of any want of clarnss, any waknss, in
th Mason’s argumnts; h dradd not to b abl to bliv in him.
“I don’t undrstand,” h said, “how it is that th mind of man
cannot attain th knowldg of which you spak.”
Th Mason smild with his gntl fathrly smil.
“Th highst wisdom and truth ar lik th purst liquid w may wish
to imbib,” h said. “Can I rciv that pur liquid into an impur
vssl and judg of its purity? Only by th innr purification of myslf
can I rtain in som dgr of purity th liquid I rciv.”
“Ys, ys, that is so,” said Pirr joyfully.
“Th highst wisdom is not foundd on rason alon, not on thos
worldly scincs of physics, history, chmistry, and th lik, into
which intllctual knowldg is dividd. Th highst wisdom is on.
Th highst wisdom has but on scinc—th scinc of th whol—th
scinc xplaining th whol cration and man’s plac in it. To
rciv that scinc it is ncssary to purify and rnw on’s innr
slf, and so bfor on can know, it is ncssary to bliv and to
prfct on’s slf. And to attain this nd, w hav th light calld
conscinc that God has implantd in our souls.”
“Ys, ys,” assntd Pirr.
“Look thn at thy innr slf with th ys of th spirit, and ask
thyslf whthr thou art contnt with thyslf. What hast thou attaind
rlying on rason only? What art thou? You ar young, you ar rich, you
ar clvr, you ar wll ducatd. And what hav you don with all ths
good gifts? Ar you contnt with yourslf and with your lif?”
“No, I hat my lif,” Pirr muttrd, wincing.
“Thou hatst it. Thn chang it, purify thyslf; and as thou art
purifid, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your lif, my dar sir.
How hav you spnt it? In riotous orgis and dbauchry, rciving
vrything from socity and giving nothing in rturn. You hav bcom
th possssor of walth. How hav you usd it? What hav you don
for your nighbor? Hav you vr thought of your tns of thousands
of slavs? Hav you hlpd thm physically and morally? No! You hav
profitd by thir toil to lad a profligat lif. That is what you hav
don. Hav you chosn a post in which you might b of srvic to your
nighbor? No! You hav spnt your lif in idlnss. Thn you marrid, my
dar sir—took on yourslf rsponsibility for th guidanc of a young
woman; and what hav you don? You hav not hlpd hr to find th way
of truth, my dar sir, but hav thrust hr into an abyss of dcit and
misry. A man offndd you and you shot him, and you say you do not
know God and hat your lif. Thr is nothing strang in that, my dar
sir!”
Aftr ths words, th Mason, as if tird by his long discours, again
land his arms on th back of th sofa and closd his ys. Pirr
lookd at that agd, strn, motionlss, almost liflss fac and movd
his lips without uttring a sound. H wishd to say, “Ys, a vil,
idl, vicious lif!” but dard not brak th silnc.
Th Mason clard his throat huskily, as old mn do, and calld his
srvant.
“How about th horss?” h askd, without looking at Pirr.
“Th xchang horss hav just com,” answrd th srvant. “Will
you not rst hr?”
“No, tll thm to harnss.”
“Can h rally b going away laving m alon without having told m
all, and without promising to hlp m?” thought Pirr, rising with
downcast had; and h bgan to pac th room, glancing occasionally at
th Mason. “Ys, I nvr thought of it, but I hav ld a contmptibl
and profligat lif, though I did not lik it and did not want to,”
thought Pirr. “But this man knows th truth and, if h wishd to,
could disclos it to m.”
Pirr wishd to say this to th Mason, but did not dar to. Th
travlr, having packd his things with his practicd hands, bgan
fastning his coat. Whn h had finishd, h turnd to Bzúkhov, and
said in a ton of indiffrnt politnss:
“Whr ar you going to now, my dar sir?”
“I?... I’m going to Ptrsburg,” answrd Pirr, in a childlik,
hsitating voic. “I thank you. I agr with all you hav said. But
do not suppos m to b so bad. With my whol soul I wish to b what you
would hav m b, but I hav nvr had hlp from anyon.... But it is
I, abov all, who am to blam for vrything. Hlp m, tach m, and
prhaps I may...”
Pirr could not go on. H gulpd and turnd away.
Th Mason rmaind silnt for a long tim, vidntly considring.
“Hlp coms from God alon,” h said, “but such masur of hlp as
our Ordr can bstow it will rndr you, my dar sir. You ar going to
Ptrsburg. Hand this to Count Willarski” (h took out his notbook
and wrot a fw words on a larg sht of papr foldd in four).
“Allow m to giv you a pic of advic. Whn you rach th capital,
first of all dvot som tim to solitud and slf-xamination and do
not rsum your formr way of lif. And now I wish you a good journy,
my dar sir,” h addd, sing that his srvant had ntrd... “and
succss.”
Th travlr was Josph Alxvich Bazdv, as Pirr saw from th
postmastr’s book. Bazdv had bn on of th bst-known Frmasons
and Martinists, vn in Novíkov’s tim. For a long whil aftr h had
gon, Pirr did not go to bd or ordr horss but pacd up and down
th room, pondring ovr his vicious past, and with a rapturous sns
of bginning anw picturd to himslf th blissful, irrproachabl,
virtuous futur that smd to him so asy. It smd to him that h had
bn vicious only bcaus h had somhow forgottn how good it is to
b virtuous. Not a trac of his formr doubts rmaind in his soul. H
firmly blivd in th possibility of th brothrhood of mn unitd in
th aim of supporting on anothr in th path of virtu, and that is how
Frmasonry prsntd itslf to him.
CHAPTR III
On raching Ptrsburg Pirr did not lt anyon know of his arrival,
h wnt nowhr and spnt whol days in rading Thomas à Kmpis, whos
book had bn snt him by somon unknown. On thing h continually
ralizd as h rad that book: th joy, hithrto unknown to him,
of bliving in th possibility of attaining prfction, and in th
possibility of activ brothrly lov among mn, which Josph Alxvich
had rvald to him. A wk aftr his arrival, th young Polish count,
Willarski, whom Pirr had known slightly in Ptrsburg socity, cam
into his room on vning in th official and crmonious mannr in
which Dólokhov’s scond had calld on him, and, having closd th
door bhind him and satisfid himslf that thr was nobody ls in th
room, addrssd Pirr.
“I hav com to you with a mssag and an offr, Count,” h
said without sitting down. “A prson of vry high standing in our
Brothrhood has mad application for you to b rcivd into our Ordr
bfor th usual trm and has proposd to m to b your sponsor. I
considr it a sacrd duty to fulfill that prson’s wishs. Do you wish
to ntr th Brothrhood of Frmasons undr my sponsorship?”
Th cold, austr ton of this man, whom h had almost always bfor mt
at balls, amiably smiling in th socity of th most brilliant womn,
surprisd Pirr.
“Ys, I do wish it,” said h.
Willarski bowd his had.
“On mor qustion, Count,” h said, “which I bg you to answr
in all sincrity—not as a futur Mason but as an honst man: hav you
rnouncd your formr convictions—do you bliv in God?”
Pirr considrd.
“Ys... ys, I bliv in God,” h said.
“In that cas...” bgan Willarski, but Pirr intrruptd him.
“Ys, I do bliv in God,” h rpatd.
“In that cas w can go,” said Willarski. “My carriag is at your
srvic.”
Willarski was silnt throughout th driv. To Pirr’s inquiris as
to what h must do and how h should answr, Willarski only rplid that
brothrs mor worthy than h would tst him and that Pirr had only to
tll th truth.
Having ntrd th courtyard of a larg hous whr th Lodg had its
hadquartrs, and having ascndd a dark staircas, thy ntrd a small
wll-lit antroom whr thy took off thir cloaks without th aid of
a srvant. From thr thy passd into anothr room. A man in strang
attir appard at th door. Willarski, stpping toward him, said
somthing to him in Frnch in an undrton and thn wnt up to a small
wardrob in which Pirr noticd garmnts such as h had nvr sn
bfor. Having takn a krchif from th cupboard, Willarski bound
Pirr’s ys with it and tid it in a knot bhind, catching som
hairs painfully in th knot. Thn h drw his fac down, kissd him, and
taking him by th hand ld him forward. Th hairs tid in th knot hurt
Pirr and thr wr lins of pain on his fac and a shamfacd smil.
His hug figur, with arms hanging down and with a puckrd, though
smiling fac, movd aftr Willarski with uncrtain, timid stps.
Having ld him about tn pacs, Willarski stoppd.
“Whatvr happns to you,” h said, “you must bar it all manfully
if you hav firmly rsolvd to join our Brothrhood.” (Pirr noddd
affirmativly.) “Whn you har a knock at th door, you will uncovr
your ys,” addd Willarski. “I wish you courag and succss,”
and, prssing Pirr’s hand, h wnt out.
Lft alon, Pirr wnt on smiling in th sam way. Onc or twic
h shruggd his shouldrs and raisd his hand to th krchif, as if
wishing to tak it off, but lt it drop again. Th fiv minuts spnt
with his ys bandagd smd to him an hour. His arms flt numb,
his lgs almost gav way, it smd to him that h was tird out. H
xprincd a varity of most complx snsations. H flt afraid of what
would happn to him and still mor afraid of showing his far. H flt
curious to know what was going to happn and what would b rvald to
him; but most of all, h flt joyful that th momnt had com whn h
would at last start on that path of rgnration and on th activly
virtuous lif of which h had bn draming sinc h mt Josph
Alxvich. Loud knocks wr hard at th door. Pirr took th bandag
off his ys and glancd around him. Th room was in black darknss,
only a small lamp was burning insid somthing whit. Pirr wnt narr
and saw that th lamp stood on a black tabl on which lay an opn book.
Th book was th Gospl, and th whit thing with th lamp insid was a
human skull with its cavitis and tth. Aftr rading th first words
of th Gospl: “In th bginning was th Word and th Word was with
God,” Pirr wnt round th tabl and saw a larg opn box filld
with somthing. It was a coffin with bons insid. H was not at all
surprisd by what h saw. Hoping to ntr on an ntirly nw lif quit
unlik th old on, h xpctd vrything to b unusual, vn mor
unusual than what h was sing. A skull, a coffin, th Gospl—it
smd to him that h had xpctd all this and vn mor. Trying
to stimulat his motions h lookd around. “God, dath, lov, th
brothrhood of man,” h kpt saying to himslf, associating ths
words with vagu yt joyful idas. Th door opnd and somon cam in.
By th dim light, to which Pirr had alrady bcom accustomd, h
saw a rathr short man. Having vidntly com from th light into th
darknss, th man pausd, thn movd with cautious stps toward th
tabl and placd on it his small lathr-glovd hands.
This short man had on a whit lathr apron which covrd his chst and
part of his lgs; h had on a kind of ncklac abov which ros a high
whit ruffl, outlining his rathr long fac which was lit up from
blow.
“For what hav you com hithr?” askd th nwcomr, turning in
Pirr’s dirction at a slight rustl mad by th lattr. “Why hav
you, who do not bliv in th truth of th light and who hav not
sn th light, com hr? What do you sk from us? Wisdom, virtu,
nlightnmnt?”
At th momnt th door opnd and th strangr cam in, Pirr flt a
sns of aw and vnration such as h had xprincd in his boyhood at
confssion; h flt himslf in th prsnc of on socially a complt
strangr, yt narr to him through th brothrhood of man. With batd
brath and bating hart h movd toward th Rhtor (by which nam th
brothr who prpard a skr for ntranc into th Brothrhood was
known). Drawing narr, h rcognizd in th Rhtor a man h knw,
Smolyanínov, and it mortifid him to think that th nwcomr was an
acquaintanc—h wishd him simply a brothr and a virtuous instructor.
For a long tim h could not uttr a word, so that th Rhtor had to
rpat his qustion.
“Ys... I... I... dsir rgnration,” Pirr uttrd with
difficulty.
“Vry wll,” said Smolyanínov, and wnt on at onc: “Hav you any
ida of th mans by which our holy Ordr will hlp you to rach your
aim?” said h quitly and quickly.
“I... hop... for guidanc... hlp... in rgnration,” said Pirr,
with a trmbling voic and som difficulty in uttranc du to his
xcitmnt and to bing unaccustomd to spak of abstract mattrs in
Russian.
“What is your concption of Frmasonry?”
“I imagin that Frmasonry is th fratrnity and quality of mn who
hav virtuous aims,” said Pirr, fling ashamd of th inadquacy
of his words for th solmnity of th momnt, as h spok. “I
imagin...”
“Good!” said th Rhtor quickly, apparntly satisfid with
this answr. “Hav you sought for mans of attaining your aim in
rligion?”
“No, I considrd it rronous and did not follow it,” said Pirr,
so softly that th Rhtor did not har him and askd him what h was
saying. “I hav bn an athist,” answrd Pirr.
“You ar sking for truth in ordr to follow its laws in your lif,
thrfor you sk wisdom and virtu. Is that not so?” said th
Rhtor, aftr a momnt’s paus.
“Ys, ys,” assntd Pirr.
Th Rhtor clard his throat, crossd his glovd hands on his brast,
and bgan to spak.
“Now I must disclos to you th chif aim of our Ordr,” h said,
“and if this aim coincids with yours, you may ntr our Brothrhood
with profit. Th first and chif objct of our Ordr, th foundation on
which it rsts and which no human powr can dstroy, is th prsrvation
and handing on to postrity of a crtain important mystry... which
has com down to us from th rmotst ags, vn from th first man—a
mystry on which prhaps th fat of mankind dpnds. But sinc this
mystry is of such a natur that nobody can know or us it unlss h b
prpard by long and dilignt slf-purification, not vryon can hop
to attain it quickly. Hnc w hav a scondary aim, that of prparing
our mmbrs as much as possibl to rform thir harts, to purify and
nlightn thir minds, by mans handd on to us by tradition from thos
who hav strivn to attain this mystry, and thrby to rndr thm
capabl of rciving it.
“By purifying and rgnrating our mmbrs w try, thirdly, to improv
th whol human rac, offring it in our mmbrs an xampl of pity
and virtu, and thrby try with all our might to combat th vil which
sways th world. Think this ovr and I will com to you again.”
“To combat th vil which sways th world...” Pirr rpatd, and a
mntal imag of his futur activity in this dirction ros in his mind.
H imagind mn such as h had himslf bn a fortnight ago, and h
addrssd an difying xhortation to thm. H imagind to himslf
vicious and unfortunat popl whom h would assist by word and dd,
imagind opprssors whos victims h would rscu. Of th thr
objcts mntiond by th Rhtor, this last, that of improving mankind,
spcially appald to Pirr. Th important mystry mntiond by th
Rhtor, though it arousd his curiosity, did not sm to him ssntial,
and th scond aim, that of purifying and rgnrating himslf, did not
much intrst him bcaus at that momnt h flt with dlight that h
was alrady prfctly curd of his formr faults and was rady for all
that was good.
Half an hour latr, th Rhtor rturnd to inform th skr of th
svn virtus, corrsponding to th svn stps of Solomon’s tmpl,
which vry Frmason should cultivat in himslf. Ths virtus wr:
1. Discrtion, th kping of th scrts of th Ordr. 2. Obdinc to
thos of highr ranks in th Ordr. 3. Morality. 4. Lov of mankind. 5.
Courag. 6. Gnrosity. 7. Th lov of dath.
“In th svnth plac, try, by th frqunt thought of dath,” th
Rhtor said, “to bring yourslf to rgard it not as a dradd fo, but
as a frind that frs th soul grown wary in th labors of virtu
from this distrssful lif, and lads it to its plac of rcompns and
pac.”
“Ys, that must b so,” thought Pirr, whn aftr ths words th
Rhtor wnt away, laving him to solitary mditation. “It must b so,
but I am still so wak that I lov my lif, th maning of which is only
now gradually opning bfor m.” But fiv of th othr virtus which
Pirr rcalld, counting thm on his fingrs, h flt alrady in his
soul: courag, gnrosity, morality, lov of mankind, and spcially
obdinc—which did not vn sm to him a virtu, but a joy. (H now
flt so glad to b fr from his own lawlssnss and to submit his will
to thos who knw th indubitabl truth.) H forgot what th svnth
virtu was and could not rcall it.
Th third tim th Rhtor cam back mor quickly and askd Pirr
whthr h was still firm in his intntion and dtrmind to submit to
all that would b rquird of him.
“I am rady for vrything,” said Pirr.
“I must also inform you,” said th Rhtor, “that our Ordr
dlivrs its taching not in words only but also by othr mans, which
may prhaps hav a strongr ffct on th sincr skr aftr wisdom
and virtu than mr words. This chambr with what you s thrin
should alrady hav suggstd to your hart, if it is sincr, mor than
words could do. You will prhaps also s in your furthr initiation a
lik mthod of nlightnmnt. Our Ordr imitats th ancint socitis
that xplaind thir taching by hiroglyphics. A hiroglyph,” said
th Rhtor, “is an mblm of somthing not cognizabl by th snss
but which posssss qualitis rsmbling thos of th symbol.”
Pirr knw vry wll what a hiroglyph was, but dard not spak. H
listnd to th Rhtor in silnc, fling from all h said that his
ordal was about to bgin.
“If you ar rsolvd, I must bgin your initiation,” said th Rhtor
coming closr to Pirr. “In tokn of gnrosity I ask you to giv m
all your valuabls.”
“But I hav nothing hr,” rplid Pirr, supposing that h was
askd to giv up all h possssd.
“What you hav with you: watch, mony, rings....”
Pirr quickly took out his purs and watch, but could not manag for
som tim to gt th wdding ring off his fat fingr. Whn that had bn
don, th Rhtor said:
“In tokn of obdinc, I ask you to undrss.”
Pirr took off his coat, waistcoat, and lft boot according to th
Rhtor’s instructions. Th Mason drw th shirt back from Pirr’s
lft brast, and stooping down pulld up th lft lg of his trousrs
to abov th kn. Pirr hurridly bgan taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up th othr trousr lg to sav this strangr th
troubl, but th Mason told him that was not ncssary and gav him
a slippr for his lft foot. With a childlik smil of mbarrassmnt,
doubt, and slf-drision, which appard on his fac against his will,
Pirr stood with his arms hanging down and lgs apart, bfor his
brothr Rhtor, and awaitd his furthr commands.
“And now, in tokn of candor, I ask you to rval to m your chif
passion,” said th lattr.
“My passion! I hav had so many,” rplid Pirr.
“That passion which mor than all othrs causd you to wavr on th
path of virtu,” said th Mason.
Pirr pausd, sking a rply.
“Win? Gluttony? Idlnss? Lazinss? Irritability? Angr? Womn?”
H wnt ovr his vics in his mind, not knowing to which of thm to giv
th pr-minnc.
“Womn,” h said in a low, scarcly audibl voic.
Th Mason did not mov and for a long tim said nothing aftr this
answr. At last h movd up to Pirr and, taking th krchif that lay
on th tabl, again bound his ys.
“For th last tim I say to you—turn all your attntion upon
yourslf, put a bridl on your snss, and sk blssdnss, not in
passion but in your own hart. Th sourc of blssdnss is not without
us but within....”
Pirr had alrady long bn fling in himslf that rfrshing sourc
of blssdnss which now floodd his hart with glad motion.
CHAPTR IV
Soon aftr this thr cam into th dark chambr to ftch Pirr, not
th Rhtor but Pirr’s sponsor, Willarski, whom h rcognizd by his
voic. To frsh qustions as to th firmnss of his rsolution Pirr
rplid: “Ys, ys, I agr,” and with a baming, childlik smil,
his fat chst uncovrd, stpping unvnly and timidly in on slipprd
and on bootd foot, h advancd, whil Willarski hld a sword to his
bar chst. H was conductd from that room along passags that turnd
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to th doors of th
Lodg. Willarski coughd, h was answrd by th Masonic knock with
mallts, th doors opnd bfor thm. A bass voic (Pirr was still
blindfoldd) qustiond him as to who h was, whn and whr h was
born, and so on. Thn h was again ld somwhr still blindfoldd,
and as thy wnt along h was told allgoris of th toils of his
pilgrimag, of holy frindship, of th trnal Architct of th
univrs, and of th courag with which h should ndur toils and
dangrs. During ths wandrings, Pirr noticd that h was spokn
of now as th “Skr,” now as th “Suffrr,” and now as th
“Postulant,” to th accompanimnt of various knockings with
mallts and swords. As h was bing ld up to som objct h noticd a
hsitation and uncrtainty among his conductors. H hard thos around
him disputing in whisprs and on of thm insisting that h should b
ld along a crtain carpt. Aftr that thy took his right hand, placd
it on somthing, and told him to hold a pair of compasss to his lft
brast with th othr hand and to rpat aftr somon who rad aloud
an oath of fidlity to th laws of th Ordr. Th candls wr thn
xtinguishd and som spirit lightd, as Pirr knw by th smll, and
h was told that h would now s th lssr light. Th bandag was
takn off his ys and, by th faint light of th burning spirit,
Pirr, as in a dram, saw svral mn standing bfor him, waring
aprons lik th Rhtor’s and holding swords in thir hands pointd at
his brast. Among thm stood a man whos whit shirt was staind with
blood. On sing this, Pirr movd forward with his brast toward th
swords, maning thm to pirc it. But th swords wr drawn back from
him and h was at onc blindfoldd again.
“Now thou hast sn th lssr light,” uttrd a voic. Thn th
candls wr rlit and h was told that h would s th full light; th
bandag was again rmovd and mor than tn voics said togthr: “Sic
transit gloria mundi.”
Pirr gradually bgan to rcovr himslf and lookd about at th room
and at th popl in it. Round a long tabl covrd with black sat som
twlv mn in garmnts lik thos h had alrady sn. Som of thm
Pirr had mt in Ptrsburg socity. In th Prsidnt’s chair sat a
young man h did not know, with a pculiar cross hanging from his
nck. On his right sat th Italian abb whom Pirr had mt at
Anna Pávlovna’s two yars bfor. Thr wr also prsnt a vry
distinguishd dignitary and a Swiss who had formrly bn tutor at th
Kurágins’. All maintaind a solmn silnc, listning to th words
of th Prsidnt, who hld a mallt in his hand. Lt into th wall was
a star-shapd light. At on sid of th tabl was a small carpt with
various figurs workd upon it, at th othr was somthing rsmbling an
altar on which lay a Tstamnt and a skull. Round it stood svn larg
candlsticks lik thos usd in churchs. Two of th brothrs ld Pirr
up to th altar, placd his ft at right angls, and bad him li down,
saying that h must prostrat himslf at th Gats of th Tmpl.
“H must first rciv th trowl,” whisprd on of th brothrs.
“Oh, hush, plas!” said anothr.
Pirr, prplxd, lookd round with his shortsightd ys without
obying, and suddnly doubts aros in his mind. “Whr am I? What am
I doing? Arn’t thy laughing at m? Shan’t I b ashamd to rmmbr
this?” But ths doubts only lastd a momnt. Pirr glancd at
th srious facs of thos around, rmmbrd all h had alrady gon
through, and ralizd that h could not stop halfway. H was aghast
at his hsitation and, trying to arous his formr dvotional fling,
prostratd himslf bfor th Gats of th Tmpl. And rally, th
fling of dvotion rturnd to him vn mor strongly than bfor. Whn
h had lain thr som tim, h was told to gt up, and a whit lathr
apron, such as th othrs wor, was put on him: h was givn a trowl
and thr pairs of glovs, and thn th Grand Mastr addrssd him. H
told him that h should try to do nothing to stain th whitnss of that
apron, which symbolizd strngth and purity; thn of th unxplaind
trowl, h told him to toil with it to clans his own hart from vic,
and indulgntly to smooth with it th hart of his nighbor. As to th
first pair of glovs, a man’s, h said that Pirr could not know
thir maning but must kp thm. Th scond pair of man’s glovs
h was to war at th mtings, and finally of th third, a pair of
womn’s glovs, h said: “Dar brothr, ths woman’s glovs ar
intndd for you too. Giv thm to th woman whom you shall honor most
of all. This gift will b a pldg of your purity of hart to hr whom
you slct to b your worthy hlpmt in Masonry.” And aftr a paus,
h addd: “But bwar, dar brothr, that ths glovs do not dck
hands that ar unclan.” Whil th Grand Mastr said ths last words
it smd to Pirr that h grw mbarrassd. Pirr himslf grw still
mor confusd, blushd lik a child till tars cam to his ys, bgan
looking about him unasily, and an awkward paus followd.
This silnc was brokn by on of th brthrn, who ld Pirr up to th
rug and bgan rading to him from a manuscript book an xplanation of
all th figurs on it: th sun, th moon, a hammr, a plumb lin, a
trowl, a rough ston and a squard ston, a pillar, thr windows, and
so on. Thn a plac was assignd to Pirr, h was shown th signs of
th Lodg, told th password, and at last was prmittd to sit down.
Th Grand Mastr bgan rading th statuts. Thy wr vry long, and
Pirr, from joy, agitation, and mbarrassmnt, was not in a stat to
undrstand what was bing rad. H managd to follow only th last words
of th statuts and ths rmaind in his mind.
“In our tmpls w rcogniz no othr distinctions,” rad th Grand
Mastr, “but thos btwn virtu and vic. Bwar of making any
distinctions which may infring quality. Fly to a brothr’s aid
whovr h may b, xhort him who goth astray, rais him that fallth,
nvr bar malic or nmity toward thy brothr. B kindly and courtous.
Kindl in all harts th flam of virtu. Shar thy happinss with thy
nighbor, and may nvy nvr dim th purity of that bliss. Forgiv thy
nmy, do not avng thyslf xcpt by doing him good. Thus fulfilling
th highst law thou shalt rgain tracs of th ancint dignity which
thou hast lost.”
H finishd and, gtting up, mbracd and kissd Pirr, who, with tars
of joy in his ys, lookd round him, not knowing how to answr th
congratulations and grtings from acquaintancs that mt him on all
sids. H acknowldgd no acquaintancs but saw in all ths mn only
brothrs, and burnd with impatinc to st to work with thm.
Th Grand Mastr rappd with his mallt. All th Masons sat down in
thir placs, and on of thm rad an xhortation on th ncssity of
humility.
Th Grand Mastr proposd that th last duty should b prformd,
and th distinguishd dignitary who bor th titl of “Collctor
of Alms” wnt round to all th brothrs. Pirr would hav likd
to subscrib all h had, but faring that it might look lik prid
subscribd th sam amount as th othrs.
Th mting was at an nd, and on raching hom Pirr flt as if h had
rturnd from a long journy on which h had spnt dozns of yars, had
bcom compltly changd, and had quit lft bhind his formr habits
and way of lif.
CHAPTR V
Th day aftr h had bn rcivd into th Lodg, Pirr was sitting at
hom rading a book and trying to fathom th significanc of th Squar,
on sid of which symbolizd God, anothr moral things, a third
physical things, and th fourth a combination of ths. Now and thn
his attntion wandrd from th book and th Squar and h formd in
imagination a nw plan of lif. On th prvious vning at th Lodg, h
had hard that a rumor of his dul had rachd th mpror and that it
would b wisr for him to lav Ptrsburg. Pirr proposd going to his
stats in th south and thr attnding to th wlfar of his srfs.
H was joyfully planning this nw lif, whn Princ Vasíli suddnly
ntrd th room.
“My dar fllow, what hav you bn up to in Moscow? Why hav you
quarrld with Hlèn, mon chr? You ar undr a dlusion,” said
Princ Vasíli, as h ntrd. “I know all about it, and I can tll
you positivly that Hlèn is as innocnt bfor you as Christ was
bfor th Jws.”
Pirr was about to rply, but Princ Vasíli intrruptd him.
“And why didn’t you simply com straight to m as to a frind? I
know all about it and undrstand it all,” h said. “You bhavd as
bcoms a man who valus his honor, prhaps too hastily, but w won’t
go into that. But considr th position in which you ar placing hr and
m in th ys of socity, and vn of th court,” h addd, lowring
his voic. “Sh is living in Moscow and you ar hr. Rmmbr,
dar boy,” and h drw Pirr’s arm downwards, “it is simply a
misundrstanding. I xpct you fl it so yourslf. Lt us writ hr
a lttr at onc, and sh’ll com hr and all will b xplaind, or
ls, my dar boy, lt m tll you it’s quit likly you’ll hav to
suffr for it.”
Princ Vasíli gav Pirr a significant look.
“I know from rliabl sourcs that th Dowagr mprss is taking a
kn intrst in th whol affair. You know sh is vry gracious to
Hlèn.”
Pirr trid svral tims to spak, but, on on hand, Princ Vasíli
did not lt him and, on th othr, Pirr himslf fard to bgin to
spak in th ton of dcidd rfusal and disagrmnt in which h had
firmly rsolvd to answr his fathr-in-law. Morovr, th words of th
Masonic statuts, “b kindly and courtous,” rcurrd to him. H
blinkd, wnt rd, got up and sat down again, struggling with himslf
to do what was for him th most difficult thing in lif—to say an
unplasant thing to a man’s fac, to say what th othr, whovr
h might b, did not xpct. H was so usd to submitting to Princ
Vasíli’s ton of carlss slf-assuranc that h flt h would b
unabl to withstand it now, but h also flt that on what h said now
his futur dpndd—whthr h would follow th sam old road, or that
nw path so attractivly shown him by th Masons, on which h firmly
blivd h would b rborn to a nw lif.
“Now, dar boy,” said Princ Vasíli playfully, “say ‘ys,’
and I’ll writ to hr myslf, and w will kill th fattd calf.”
But bfor Princ Vasíli had finishd his playful spch, Pirr,
without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that mad him lik his
fathr, muttrd in a whispr:
“Princ, I did not ask you hr. Go, plas go!” And h jumpd up
and opnd th door for him.
“Go!” h rpatd, amazd at himslf and glad to s th look of
confusion and far that showd itslf on Princ Vasíli’s fac.
“What’s th mattr with you? Ar you ill?”
“Go!” th quivring voic rpatd. And Princ Vasíli had to go
without rciving any xplanation.
A wk latr, Pirr, having takn lav of his nw frinds, th Masons,
and laving larg sums of mony with thm for alms, wnt away to his
stats. His nw brthrn gav him lttrs to th Kiv and Odssa Masons
and promisd to writ to him and guid him in his nw activity.
CHAPTR VI
Th dul btwn Pirr and Dólokhov was hushd up and, in spit of
th mpror’s svrity rgarding duls at that tim, nithr th
principals nor thir sconds suffrd for it. But th story of th dul,
confirmd by Pirr’s ruptur with his wif, was th talk of socity.
Pirr who had bn rgardd with patronizing condscnsion whn h was
an illgitimat son, and pttd and xtolld whn h was th bst
match in Russia, had sunk gratly in th stm of socity aftr his
marriag—whn th marriagabl daughtrs and thir mothrs had nothing
to hop from him—spcially as h did not know how, and did not
wish, to court socity’s favor. Now h alon was blamd for what had
happnd, h was said to b insanly jalous and subjct lik his
fathr to fits of bloodthirsty rag. And whn aftr Pirr’s
dpartur Hlèn rturnd to Ptrsburg, sh was rcivd by all hr
acquaintancs not only cordially, but vn with a shad of dfrnc
du to hr misfortun. Whn convrsation turnd on hr husband Hlèn
assumd a dignifid xprssion, which with charactristic tact sh had
acquird though sh did not undrstand its significanc. This xprssion
suggstd that sh had rsolvd to ndur hr troubls uncomplainingly
and that hr husband was a cross laid upon hr by God. Princ Vasíli
xprssd his opinion mor opnly. H shruggd his shouldrs whn Pirr
was mntiond and, pointing to his forhad, rmarkd:
“A bit touchd—I always said so.”
“I said from th first,” dclard Anna Pávlovna rfrring to
Pirr, “I said at th tim and bfor anyon ls” (sh insistd
on hr priority) “that that snslss young man was spoild by th
dpravd idas of ths days. I said so vn at th tim whn vrybody
was in rapturs about him, whn h had just rturnd from abroad, and
whn, if you rmmbr, h posd as a sort of Marat at on of my soirs.
And how has it ndd? I was against this marriag vn thn and fortold
all that has happnd.”
Anna Pávlovna continud to giv on fr vnings th sam kind of
soirs as bfor—such as sh alon had th gift of arranging—at
which was to b found “th cram of rally good socity, th bloom
of th intllctual ssnc of Ptrsburg,” as sh hrslf put it.
Bsids this rfind slction of socity Anna Pávlovna’s rcptions
wr also distinguishd by th fact that sh always prsntd som nw
and intrsting prson to th visitors and that nowhr ls was th
stat of th political thrmomtr of lgitimat Ptrsburg court
socity so darly and distinctly indicatd.
Toward th nd of 1806, whn all th sad dtails of Napolon’s
dstruction of th Prussian army at Jna and Aurstädt and th
surrndr of most of th Prussian fortrsss had bn rcivd, whn our
troops had alrady ntrd Prussia and our scond war with Napolon
was bginning, Anna Pávlovna gav on of hr soirs. Th “cram of
rally good socity” consistd of th fascinating Hlèn, forsakn
by hr husband, Mortmart, th dlightful Princ Hippolyt who had
just rturnd from Vinna, two diplomatists, th old aunt, a young man
rfrrd to in that drawing room as “a man of grat mrit” (un homm
d baucoup d mrit), a nwly appointd maid of honor and hr mothr,
and svral othr lss notworthy prsons.
Th novlty Anna Pávlovna was stting bfor hr gusts that vning
was Borís Drubtskóy, who had just arrivd as a spcial mssngr from
th Prussian army and was aid-d-camp to a vry important prsonag.
Th tmpratur shown by th political thrmomtr to th company that
vning was this:
“Whatvr th uropan sovrigns and commandrs may do to
countnanc Bonapart, and to caus m, and us in gnral, annoyanc and
mortification, our opinion of Bonapart cannot altr. W shall not cas
to xprss our sincr viws on that subjct, and can only say to th
King of Prussia and othrs: ‘So much th wors for you. Tu l’as
voulu, Gorg Dandin,’ that’s all w hav to say about it!”
Whn Borís, who was to b srvd up to th gusts, ntrd th drawing
room, almost all th company had assmbld, and th convrsation, guidd
by Anna Pávlovna, was about our diplomatic rlations with Austria and
th hop of an allianc with hr.
Borís, grown mor manly and looking frsh, rosy and slf-possssd,
ntrd th drawing room lgantly drssd in th uniform of an
aid-d-camp and was duly conductd to pay his rspcts to th aunt and
thn brought back to th gnral circl.
Anna Pávlovna gav him hr shrivld hand to kiss and introducd him to
svral prsons whom h did not know, giving him a whisprd dscription
of ach.
“Princ Hippolyt Kurágin—charming young fllow; M.
Kronq,—charg d’affairs from Copnhagn—a profound intllct,”
and simply, “Mr. Shítov—a man of grat mrit”—this of th man
usually so dscribd.
Thanks to Anna Mikháylovna’s fforts, his own tasts, and th
pculiaritis of his rsrvd natur, Borís had managd during his
srvic to plac himslf vry advantagously. H was aid-d-camp to a
vry important prsonag, had bn snt on a vry important mission to
Prussia, and had just rturnd from thr as a spcial mssngr. H had
bcom thoroughly convrsant with that unwrittn cod with which h had
bn so plasd at Olmütz and according to which an nsign might rank
incomparably highr than a gnral, and according to which what was
ndd for succss in th srvic was not ffort or work, or courag, or
prsvranc, but only th knowldg of how to gt on with thos who can
grant rwards, and h was himslf oftn surprisd at th rapidity of his
succss and at th inability of othrs to undrstand ths things.
In consqunc of this discovry his whol mannr of lif, all
his rlations with old frinds, all his plans for his futur, wr
compltly altrd. H was not rich, but would spnd his last groat to
b bttr drssd than othrs, and would rathr dpriv himslf of many
plasurs than allow himslf to b sn in a shabby quipag or appar
in th strts of Ptrsburg in an old uniform. H mad frinds with
and sought th acquaintanc of only thos abov him in position and
who could thrfor b of us to him. H likd Ptrsburg and dspisd
Moscow. Th rmmbranc of th Rostóvs’ hous and of his childish
lov for Natásha was unplasant to him and h had not onc bn to s
th Rostóvs sinc th day of his dpartur for th army. To b in Anna
Pávlovna’s drawing room h considrd an important stp up in th
srvic, and h at onc undrstood his rol, ltting his hostss mak
us of whatvr intrst h had to offr. H himslf carfully scannd
ach fac, appraising th possibilitis of stablishing intimacy with
ach of thos prsnt, and th advantags that might accru. H took
th sat indicatd to him bsid th fair Hlèn and listnd to th
gnral convrsation.
“Vinna considrs th bass of th proposd traty so unattainabl
that not vn a continuity of most brilliant succsss would scur
thm, and sh doubts th mans w hav of gaining thm. That is th
actual phras usd by th Vinna cabint,” said th Danish charg
d’affairs.
“Th doubt is flattring,” said “th man of profound intllct,”
with a subtl smil.
“W must distinguish btwn th Vinna cabint and th mpror of
Austria,” said Mortmart. “Th mpror of Austria can nvr hav
thought of such a thing, it is only th cabint that says it.”
“Ah, my dar vicomt,” put in Anna Pávlovna, “L’Urop” (for
som rason sh calld it Urop as if that wr a spcially rfind
Frnch pronunciation which sh could allow hrslf whn convrsing with
a Frnchman), “L’Urop n sra jamais notr alli sincèr.” *
    * “urop will nvr b our sincr ally.”
Aftr that Anna Pávlovna ld up to th courag and firmnss of th King
of Prussia, in ordr to draw Borís into th convrsation.
Borís listnd attntivly to ach of th spakrs, awaiting his turn,
but managd manwhil to look round rpatdly at his nighbor, th
bautiful Hlèn, whos ys svral tims mt thos of th handsom
young aid-d-camp with a smil.
Spaking of th position of Prussia, Anna Pávlovna vry naturally askd
Borís to tll thm about his journy to Glogau and in what stat h
found th Prussian army. Borís, spaking with dlibration, told thm
in pur, corrct Frnch many intrsting dtails about th armis and
th court, carfully abstaining from xprssing an opinion of his
own about th facts h was rcounting. For som tim h ngrossd th
gnral attntion, and Anna Pávlovna flt that th novlty sh had
srvd up was rcivd with plasur by all hr visitors. Th gratst
attntion of all to Borís’ narrativ was shown by Hlèn. Sh askd
him svral qustions about his journy and smd gratly intrstd in
th stat of th Prussian army. As soon as h had finishd sh turnd to
him with hr usual smil.
“You absolutly must com and s m,” sh said in a ton that
implid that, for crtain considrations h could not know of, this was
absolutly ncssary.
“On Tusday btwn ight and nin. It will giv m grat plasur.”
Borís promisd to fulfill hr wish and was about to bgin a
convrsation with hr, whn Anna Pávlovna calld him away on th
prtxt that hr aunt wishd to har him.
“You know hr husband, of cours?” said Anna Pávlovna, closing hr
ys and indicating Hlèn with a sorrowful gstur. “Ah, sh is
such an unfortunat and charming woman! Don’t mntion him bfor
hr—plas don’t! It is too painful for hr!”
CHAPTR VII
Whn Borís and Anna Pávlovna rturnd to th othrs Princ Hippolyt
had th ar of th company.
Bnding forward in his armchair h said: “L Roi d Pruss!” and
having said this laughd. vryon turnd toward him.
“L Roi d Pruss?” Hippolyt said intrrogativly, again laughing,
and thn calmly and sriously sat back in his chair. Anna Pávlovna
waitd for him to go on, but as h smd quit dcidd to say no mor
sh bgan to tll of how at Potsdam th impious Bonapart had stoln th
sword of Frdrick th Grat.
“It is th sword of Frdrick th Grat which I...” sh bgan, but
Hippolyt intrruptd hr with th words: “L Roi d Pruss...” and
again, as soon as all turnd toward him, xcusd himslf and said no
mor.
Anna Pávlovna frownd. Mortmart, Hippolyt’s frind, addrssd him
firmly.
“Com now, what about your Roi d Pruss?”
Hippolyt laughd as if ashamd of laughing.
“Oh, it’s nothing. I only wishd to say...” (h wantd to rpat
a jok h had hard in Vinna and which h had bn trying all that
vning to gt in) “I only wishd to say that w ar wrong to fight
pour l Roi d Pruss!”
Borís smild circumspctly, so that it might b takn as ironical
or apprciativ according to th way th jok was rcivd. vrybody
laughd.
“Your jok is too bad, it’s witty but unjust,” said Anna
Pávlovna, shaking hr littl shrivld fingr at him.
“W ar not fighting pour l Roi d Pruss, but for right principls.
Oh, that wickd Princ Hippolyt!” sh said.
Th convrsation did not flag all vning and turnd chifly on th
political nws. It bcam particularly animatd toward th nd of th
vning whn th rwards bstowd by th mpror wr mntiond.
“You know N— N— rcivd a snuffbox with th portrait last
yar?” said “th man of profound intllct.” “Why shouldn’t
S— S— gt th sam distinction?”
“Pardon m! A snuffbox with th mpror’s portrait is a rward but
not a distinction,” said th diplomatist—“a gift, rathr.”
“Thr ar prcdnts, I may mntion Schwarznbrg.”
“It’s impossibl,” rplid anothr.
“Will you bt? Th ribbon of th ordr is a diffrnt mattr....”
Whn vrybody ros to go, Hlèn who had spokn vry littl all
th vning again turnd to Borís, asking him in a ton of carssing
significant command to com to hr on Tusday.
“It is of grat importanc to m,” sh said, turning with a smil

which sh spok of hr xaltd patronss, supportd Hlèn’s wish.
It smd as if from som words Borís had spokn that vning about th
Prussian army, Hlèn had suddnly found it ncssary to s him.
Sh smd to promis to xplain that ncssity to him whn h cam on
Tusday.
But on Tusday vning, having com to Hlèn’s splndid salon,
Borís rcivd no clar xplanation of why it had bn ncssary for

tomorrow... in th vning. You must com.... Com!”
During that stay in Ptrsburg, Borís bcam an intimat in th
countss’ hous.
CHAPTR VIII
Th war was flaming up and naring th Russian frontir. vrywhr on
hard curss on Bonapart, “th nmy of mankind.” Militiamn and
rcruits wr bing nrolld in th villags, and from th sat of
war cam contradictory nws, fals as usual and thrfor variously
intrprtd. Th lif of old Princ Bolkónski, Princ Andrw, and
Princss Mary had gratly changd sinc 1805.
In 1806 th old princ was mad on of th ight commandrs in chif
thn appointd to suprvis th nrollmnt dcrd throughout Russia.
Dspit th waknss of ag, which had bcom particularly noticabl
sinc th tim whn h thought his son had bn killd, h did not think
it right to rfus a duty to which h had bn appointd by th mpror
himslf, and this frsh opportunity for action gav him nw nrgy
and strngth. H was continually travling through th thr provincs
ntrustd to him, was pdantic in th fulfillmnt of his dutis, svr
to crul with his subordinats, and wnt into vrything down to th
minutst dtails himslf. Princss Mary had casd taking lssons in
mathmatics from hr fathr, and whn th old princ was at hom wnt
to his study with th wt nurs and littl Princ Nicholas (as his
grandfathr calld him). Th baby Princ Nicholas livd with his wt
nurs and nurs Sávishna in th lat princss’ rooms and Princss
Mary spnt most of th day in th nursry, taking a mothr’s plac to
hr littl nphw as bst sh could. Madmoisll Bourinn, too, smd
passionatly fond of th boy, and Princss Mary oftn dprivd hrslf
to giv hr frind th plasur of dandling th littl angl—as sh
calld hr nphw—and playing with him.
Nar th altar of th church at Bald Hills thr was a chapl ovr th
tomb of th littl princss, and in this chapl was a marbl monumnt
brought from Italy, rprsnting an angl with outsprad wings rady to
fly upwards. Th angl’s uppr lip was slightly raisd as though
about to smil, and onc on coming out of th chapl Princ Andrw and
Princss Mary admittd to on anothr that th angl’s fac rmindd
thm strangly of th littl princss. But what was still strangr,
though of this Princ Andrw said nothing to his sistr, was that in th
xprssion th sculptor had happnd to giv th angl’s fac, Princ
Andrw rad th sam mild rproach h had rad on th fac of his dad
wif: “Ah, why hav you don this to m?”
Soon aftr Princ Andrw’s rturn th old princ mad ovr to him a
larg stat, Boguchárovo, about twnty-fiv mils from Bald Hills.
Partly bcaus of th dprssing mmoris associatd with Bald Hills,
partly bcaus Princ Andrw did not always fl qual to baring with
his fathr’s pculiaritis, and partly bcaus h ndd solitud,
Princ Andrw mad us of Boguchárovo, bgan building and spnt most of
his tim thr.
Aftr th Austrlitz campaign Princ Andrw had firmly rsolvd not
to continu his military srvic, and whn th war rcommncd
and vrybody had to srv, h took a post undr his fathr in th
rcruitmnt so as to avoid activ srvic. Th old princ and his son
smd to hav changd rols sinc th campaign of 1805. Th old man,
rousd by activity, xpctd th bst rsults from th nw campaign,
whil Princ Andrw on th contrary, taking no part in th war and
scrtly rgrtting this, saw only th dark sid.
On Fbruary 26, 1807, th old princ st off on on of his circuits.
Princ Andrw rmaind at Bald Hills as usual during his fathr’s
absnc. Littl Nicholas had bn unwll for four days. Th coachman who
had drivn th old princ to town rturnd bringing paprs and lttrs
for Princ Andrw.
Not finding th young princ in his study th valt wnt with th
lttrs to Princss Mary’s apartmnts, but did not find him thr. H
was told that th princ had gon to th nursry.
“If you plas, your xcllncy, Ptrusha has brought som paprs,”
said on of th nursmaids to Princ Andrw who was sitting on a
child’s littl chair whil, frowning and with trmbling hands, h
pourd drops from a mdicin bottl into a winglass half full of watr.
“What is it?” h said crossly, and, his hand shaking
unintntionally, h pourd too many drops into th glass. H thrw th
mixtur onto th floor and askd for som mor watr. Th maid brought
it.
Thr wr in th room a child’s cot, two boxs, two armchairs, a
tabl, a child’s tabl, and th littl chair on which Princ Andrw
was sitting. Th curtains wr drawn, and a singl candl was burning on
th tabl, scrnd by a bound music book so that th light did not fall
on th cot.
“My dar,” said Princss Mary, addrssing hr brothr from bsid
th cot whr sh was standing, “bttr wait a bit... latr...”
“Oh, lav off, you always talk nonsns and kp putting things
off—and this is what coms of it!” said Princ Andrw in an
xaspratd whispr, vidntly maning to wound his sistr.
“My dar, rally... it’s bttr not to wak him... h’s aslp,”
said th princss in a ton of ntraty.
Princ Andrw got up and wnt on tipto up to th littl bd, winglass
in hand.
“Prhaps w’d rally bttr not wak him,” h said hsitating.
“As you plas... rally... I think so... but as you plas,” said
Princss Mary, vidntly intimidatd and confusd that hr opinion
had prvaild. Sh drw hr brothr’s attntion to th maid who was
calling him in a whispr.
It was th scond night that nithr of thm had slpt, watching th boy
who was in a high fvr. Ths last days, mistrusting thir houshold
doctor and xpcting anothr for whom thy had snt to town, thy had
bn trying first on rmdy and thn anothr. Worn out by slplssnss
and anxity thy thrw thir burdn of sorrow on on anothr and
rproachd and disputd with ach othr.
“Ptrusha has com with paprs from your fathr,” whisprd th
maid.
Princ Andrw wnt out.
“Dvil tak thm!” h muttrd, and aftr listning to th vrbal
instructions his fathr had snt and taking th corrspondnc and his
fathr’s lttr, h rturnd to th nursry.
“Wll?” h askd.
“Still th sam. Wait, for havn’s sak. Karl Ivánich always says
that slp is mor important than anything,” whisprd Princss Mary
with a sigh.
Princ Andrw wnt up to th child and flt him. H was burning hot.
“Confound you and your Karl Ivánich!” H took th glass with th
drops and again wnt up to th cot.
“Andrw, don’t!” said Princss Mary.
But h scowld at hr angrily though also with suffring in his ys,
and stoopd glass in hand ovr th infant.
“But I wish it,” h said. “I bg you—giv it him!”
Princss Mary shruggd hr shouldrs but took th glass submissivly
and calling th nurs bgan giving th mdicin. Th child scramd
hoarsly. Princ Andrw wincd and, clutching his had, wnt out and sat
down on a sofa in th nxt room.
H still had all th lttrs in his hand. Opning thm mchanically h
bgan rading. Th old princ, now and thn using abbrviations, wrot
in his larg longatd hand on blu papr as follows:
Hav just this momnt rcivd by spcial mssngr vry joyful
nws—if it’s not fals. Bnnigsn sms to hav obtaind a complt
victory ovr Buonapart at ylau. In Ptrsburg vryon is rjoicing,
and th rwards snt to th army ar innumrabl. Though h is a
Grman—I congratulat him! I can’t mak out what th commandr at
Kórchvo—a crtain Khandrikóv—is up to; till now th additional
mn and provisions hav not arrivd. Gallop off to him at onc and
say I’ll hav his had off if vrything is not hr in a wk.
Hav rcivd anothr lttr about th Prussisch-ylau battl
from Ptnka—h took part in it—and it’s all tru. Whn
mischif-makrs don’t mddl vn a Grman bats Buonapart. H is
said to b fling in grat disordr. Mind you gallop off to Kórchvo
without dlay and carry out instructions!
Princ Andrw sighd and brok th sal of anothr nvlop. It was
a closly writtn lttr of two shts from Bilíbin. H foldd it up
without rading it and rrad his fathr’s lttr, nding with th
words: “Gallop off to Kórchvo and carry out instructions!”
“No, pardon m, I won’t go now till th child is bttr,” thought
h, going to th door and looking into th nursry.
Princss Mary was still standing by th cot, gntly rocking th baby.
“Ah ys, and what ls did h say that’s unplasant?” thought
Princ Andrw, rcalling his fathr’s lttr. “Ys, w hav gaind
a victory ovr Bonapart, just whn I’m not srving. Ys, ys, h’s
always poking fun at m.... Ah, wll! Lt him!” And h bgan rading
Bilíbin’s lttr which was writtn in Frnch. H rad without
undrstanding half of it, rad only to forgt, if but for a momnt, what
h had too long bn thinking of so painfully to th xclusion of all
ls.
CHAPTR IX
Bilíbin was now at army hadquartrs in a diplomatic capacity, and
though h wrot in Frnch and usd Frnch jsts and Frnch idioms,
h dscribd th whol campaign with a farlss slf-cnsur and
slf-drision gnuinly Russian. Bilíbin wrot that th obligation of
diplomatic discrtion tormntd him, and h was happy to hav in Princ
Andrw a rliabl corrspondnt to whom h could pour out th bil h
had accumulatd at th sight of all that was bing don in th army.
Th lttr was old, having bn writtn bfor th battl at
Prussisch-ylau.
“Sinc th day of our brilliant succss at Austrlitz,” wrot
Bilíbin, “as you know, my dar princ, I nvr lav hadquartrs. I
hav crtainly acquird a tast for war, and it is just as wll for m;
what I hav sn during ths last thr months is incrdibl.
“I bgin ab ovo. ‘Th nmy of th human rac,’ as you know,
attacks th Prussians. Th Prussians ar our faithful allis who hav
only btrayd us thr tims in thr yars. W tak up thir caus, but
it turns out that ‘th nmy of th human rac’ pays no hd to
our fin spchs and in his rud and savag way throws himslf on th
Prussians without giving thm tim to finish th parad thy had bgun,
and in two twists of th hand h braks thm to smithrns and installs
himslf in th palac at Potsdam.
“‘I most ardntly dsir,’ writs th King of Prussia to
Bonapart, ‘that Your Majsty should b rcivd and tratd in my
palac in a mannr agrabl to yourslf, and in so far as circumstancs
allowd, I hav hastnd to tak all stps to that nd. May I hav
succdd!’ Th Prussian gnrals prid thmslvs on bing polit to
th Frnch and lay down thir arms at th first dmand.
“Th had of th garrison at Glogau, with tn thousand mn, asks th
King of Prussia what h is to do if h is summond to surrndr.... All
this is absolutly tru.
“In short, hoping to sttl mattrs by taking up a warlik attitud,
it turns out that w hav landd ourslvs in war, and what is mor,
in war on our own frontirs, with and for th King of Prussia. W hav
vrything in prfct ordr, only on littl thing is lacking, namly,
a commandr in chif. As it was considrd that th Austrlitz succss
might hav bn mor dcisiv had th commandr in chif not bn so
young, all our octognarians wr rviwd, and of Prozoróvski
and Kámnski th lattr was prfrrd. Th gnral coms to us,
Suvórov-lik, in a kibítka, and is rcivd with acclamations of joy
and triumph.
“On th 4th, th first courir arrivs from Ptrsburg. Th mails
ar takn to th fild marshal’s room, for h liks to do vrything
himslf. I am calld in to hlp sort th lttrs and tak thos mant
for us. Th fild marshal looks on and waits for lttrs addrssd
to him. W sarch, but non ar to b found. Th fild marshal grows
impatint and sts to work himslf and finds lttrs from th mpror
to Count T., Princ V., and othrs. Thn h bursts into on of his wild
furis and rags at vryon and vrything, sizs th lttrs, opns
thm, and rads thos from th mpror addrssd to othrs. ‘Ah! So
that’s th way thy trat m! No confidnc in m! Ah, ordrd to kp
an y on m! Vry wll thn! Gt along with you!’ So h writs th
famous ordr of th day to Gnral Bnnigsn:
“‘I am woundd and cannot rid and consquntly cannot command th
army. You hav brought your army corps to Pultúsk, routd: hr it is
xposd, and without ful or forag, so somthing must b don, and, as
you yourslf rportd to Count Buxhöwdn ystrday, you must think of
rtrating to our frontir—which do today.’
“‘From all my riding,’ h writs to th mpror, ‘I hav got a
saddl sor which, coming aftr all my prvious journys, quit prvnts
my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I hav passd on th
command to th gnral nxt in sniority, Count Buxhöwdn, having snt
him my whol staff and all that blongs to it, advising him if thr is
a lack of brad, to mov farthr into th intrior of Prussia, for only
on day’s ration of brad rmains, and in som rgimnts non at all,
as rportd by th division commandrs, Ostrmann and Sdmortzki, and
all that th pasants had has bn atn up. I myslf will rmain in
hospital at Ostrolnka till I rcovr. In rgard to which I humbly
submit my rport, with th information that if th army rmains in its
prsnt bivouac anothr fortnight thr will not b a halthy man lft
in it by spring.
“‘Grant lav to rtir to his country sat to an old man who is
alrady in any cas dishonord by bing unabl to fulfill th grat and
glorious task for which h was chosn. I shall await your most gracious
prmission hr in hospital, that I may not hav to play th part of a
scrtary rathr than commandr in th army. My rmoval from th army
dos not produc th slightst stir—a blind man has lft it. Thr ar
thousands such as I in Russia.’
“Th fild marshal is angry with th mpror and h punishs us all,
isn’t it logical?
“This is th first act. Thos that follow ar naturally incrasingly
intrsting and ntrtaining. Aftr th fild marshal’s dpartur
it appars that w ar within sight of th nmy and must giv battl.
Buxhöwdn is commandr in chif by sniority, but Gnral Bnnigsn
dos not quit s it; mor particularly as it is h and his corps who
ar within sight of th nmy and h wishs to profit by th opportunity
to fight a battl ‘on his own hand’ as th Grmans say. H dos so.
This is th battl of Pultúsk, which is considrd a grat victory but
in my opinion was nothing of th kind. W civilians, as you know, hav
a vry bad way of dciding whthr a battl was won or lost. Thos who
rtrat aftr a battl hav lost it is what w say; and according to
that it is w who lost th battl of Pultúsk. In short, w rtrat
aftr th battl but snd a courir to Ptrsburg with nws of a
victory, and Gnral Bnnigsn, hoping to rciv from Ptrsburg th
post of commandr in chif as a rward for his victory, dos not giv up
th command of th army to Gnral Buxhöwdn. During this intrrgnum
w bgin a vry original and intrsting sris of manuvrs. Our aim is
no longr, as it should b, to avoid or attack th nmy, but solly to
avoid Gnral Buxhöwdn who by right of sniority should b our chif.
So nrgtically do w pursu this aim that aftr crossing an unfordabl
rivr w burn th bridgs to sparat ourslvs from our nmy, who at
th momnt is not Bonapart but Buxhöwdn. Gnral Buxhöwdn was all
but attackd and capturd by a suprior nmy forc as a rsult of on
of ths manuvrs that nabld us to scap him. Buxhöwdn pursus
us—w scuttl. H hardly crosss th rivr to our sid bfor w
rcross to th othr. At last our nmy, Buxhöwdn, catchs us and
attacks. Both gnrals ar angry, and th rsult is a challng on
Buxhöwdn’s part and an pilptic fit on Bnnigsn’s. But at th
critical momnt th courir who carrid th nws of our victory at
Pultúsk to Ptrsburg rturns bringing our appointmnt as commandr in
chif, and our first fo, Buxhöwdn, is vanquishd; w can now turn
our thoughts to th scond, Bonapart. But as it turns out, just at
that momnt a third nmy riss bfor us—namly th Orthodox Russian
soldirs, loudly dmanding brad, mat, biscuits, foddr, and whatnot!
Th stors ar mpty, th roads impassabl. Th Orthodox bgin looting,
and in a way of which our last campaign can giv you no ida. Half th
rgimnts form bands and scour th countrysid and put vrything
to fir and sword. Th inhabitants ar totally ruind, th hospitals
ovrflow with sick, and famin is vrywhr. Twic th maraudrs vn
attack our hadquartrs, and th commandr in chif has to ask for a
battalion to disprs thm. During on of ths attacks thy carrid off
my mpty portmantau and my drssing gown. Th mpror proposs to giv
all commandrs of divisions th right to shoot maraudrs, but I much
far this will oblig on half th army to shoot th othr.”
At first Princ Andrw rad with his ys only, but aftr a whil,
in spit of himslf (although h knw how far it was saf to trust
Bilíbin), what h had rad bgan to intrst him mor and mor. Whn h
had rad thus far, h crumpld th lttr up and thrw it away. It was
not what h had rad that vxd him, but th fact that th lif out
thr in which h had now no part could prturb him. H shut his ys,
rubbd his forhad as if to rid himslf of all intrst in what h
had rad, and listnd to what was passing in th nursry. Suddnly h
thought h hard a strang nois through th door. H was sizd with
alarm lst somthing should hav happnd to th child whil h was
rading th lttr. H wnt on tipto to th nursry door and opnd it.
Just as h wnt in h saw that th nurs was hiding somthing from him
with a scard look and that Princss Mary was no longr by th cot.
“My dar,” h hard what smd to him hr dspairing whispr bhind
him.
As oftn happns aftr long slplssnss and long anxity, h was
sizd by an unrasoning panic—it occurrd to him that th child was
dad. All that h saw and hard smd to confirm this trror.
“All is ovr,” h thought, and a cold swat brok out on his
forhad. H wnt to th cot in confusion, sur that h would find it
mpty and that th nurs had bn hiding th dad baby. H drw th
curtain asid and for som tim his frightnd, rstlss ys could not
find th baby. At last h saw him: th rosy boy had tossd about till h
lay across th bd with his had lowr than th pillow, and was smacking
his lips in his slp and brathing vnly.
Princ Andrw was as glad to find th boy lik that, as if h had
alrady lost him. H bnt ovr him and, as his sistr had taught him,
trid with his lips whthr th child was still fvrish. Th soft
forhad was moist. Princ Andrw touchd th had with his hand; vn
th hair was wt, so profusly had th child prspird. H was not dad,
but vidntly th crisis was ovr and h was convalscnt. Princ Andrw
longd to snatch up, to squz, to hold to his hart, this hlplss
littl cratur, but dard not do so. H stood ovr him, gazing at his
had and at th littl arms and lgs which showd undr th blankt. H
hard a rustl bhind him and a shadow appard undr th curtain of
th cot. H did not look round, but still gazing at th infant’s fac
listnd to his rgular brathing. Th dark shadow was Princss Mary,
who had com up to th cot with noislss stps, liftd th curtain,
and droppd it again bhind hr. Princ Andrw rcognizd hr without
looking and hld out his hand to hr. Sh prssd it.
“H has prspird,” said Princ Andrw.
“I was coming to tll you so.”
Th child movd slightly in his slp, smild, and rubbd his forhad
against th pillow.
Princ Andrw lookd at his sistr. In th dim shadow of th curtain hr
luminous ys shon mor brightly than usual from th tars of joy that
wr in thm. Sh land ovr to hr brothr and kissd him, slightly
catching th curtain of th cot. ach mad th othr a warning gstur
and stood still in th dim light bnath th curtain as if not wishing
to lav that sclusion whr thy thr wr shut off from all th
world. Princ Andrw was th first to mov away, ruffling his hair
against th muslin of th curtain.
“Ys, this is th on thing lft m now,” h said with a sigh.
CHAPTR X
Soon aftr his admission to th Masonic Brothrhood, Pirr wnt to th
Kiv provinc, whr h had th gratst numbr of srfs, taking with
him full dirctions which h had writtn down for his own guidanc as to
what h should do on his stats.
Whn h rachd Kiv h snt for all his stwards to th had offic
and xplaind to thm his intntions and wishs. H told thm that stps
would b takn immdiatly to fr his srfs—and that till thn thy
wr not to b ovrburdnd with labor, womn whil nursing thir babis
wr not to b snt to work, assistanc was to b givn to th srfs,
punishmnts wr to b admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals,
asylums, and schools wr to b stablishd on all th stats. Som of
th stwards (thr wr smilitrat formn among thm) listnd with
alarm, supposing ths words to man that th young count was displasd
with thir managmnt and mbzzlmnt of mony, som aftr thir first
fright wr amusd by Pirr’s lisp and th nw words thy had not
hard bfor, othrs simply njoyd haring how th mastr talkd, whil
th clvrst among thm, including th chif stward, undrstood from
this spch how thy could bst handl th mastr for thir own nds.
Th chif stward xprssd grat sympathy with Pirr’s intntions,
but rmarkd that bsids ths changs it would b ncssary to go into
th gnral stat of affairs which was far from satisfactory.
Dspit Count Bzúkhov’s normous walth, sinc h had com into an
incom which was said to amount to fiv hundrd thousand rubls a yar,
Pirr flt himslf far poorr than whn his fathr had mad him
an allowanc of tn thousand rubls. H had a dim prcption of th
following budgt:
About 80,000 wnt in paymnts on all th stats to th Land Bank, about
30,000 wnt for th upkp of th stat nar Moscow, th town hous,
and th allowanc to th thr princsss; about 15,000 was givn in
pnsions and th sam amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was snt to
th countss; about 70,000 wnt for intrst on dbts. Th building of a
nw church, prviously bgun, had cost about 10,000 in ach of th last
two yars, and h did not know how th rst, about 100,000 rubls, was
spnt, and almost vry yar h was obligd to borrow. Bsids this th
chif stward wrot vry yar tlling him of firs and bad harvsts,
or of th ncssity of rbuilding factoris and workshops. So th first
task Pirr had to fac was on for which h had vry littl aptitud or
inclination—practical businss.
H discussd stat affairs vry day with his chif stward. But
h flt that this did not forward mattrs at all. H flt that ths
consultations wr dtachd from ral affairs and did not link up with
thm or mak thm mov. On th on hand, th chif stward put th stat
of things to him in th vry worst light, pointing out th ncssity of
paying off th dbts and undrtaking nw activitis with srf labor,
to which Pirr did not agr. On th othr hand, Pirr dmandd that
stps should b takn to librat th srfs, which th stward mt by
showing th ncssity of first paying off th loans from th Land Bank,
and th consqunt impossibility of a spdy mancipation.
Th stward did not say it was quit impossibl, but suggstd slling
th forsts in th provinc of Kostromá, th land lowr down th rivr,
and th Criman stat, in ordr to mak it possibl: all of which
oprations according to him wr connctd with such complicatd
masurs—th rmoval of injunctions, ptitions, prmits, and so
on—that Pirr bcam quit bwildrd and only rplid:
“Ys, ys, do so.”
Pirr had non of th practical prsistnc that would hav nabld him
to attnd to th businss himslf and so h dislikd it and only trid
to prtnd to th stward that h was attnding to it. Th stward
for his part trid to prtnd to th count that h considrd ths
consultations vry valuabl for th propritor and troublsom to
himslf.
In Kiv Pirr found som popl h knw, and strangrs hastnd to mak
his acquaintanc and joyfully wlcomd th rich nwcomr, th
largst landownr of th provinc. Tmptations to Pirr’s gratst
waknss—th on to which h had confssd whn admittd to th
Lodg—wr so strong that h could not rsist thm. Again whol days,
wks, and months of his lif passd in as grat a rush and wr as much
occupid with vning partis, dinnrs, lunchs, and balls, giving him
no tim for rflction, as in Ptrsburg. Instad of th nw lif h had
hopd to lad h still livd th old lif, only in nw surroundings.
Of th thr prcpts of Frmasonry Pirr ralizd that h did not
fulfill th on which njoind vry Mason to st an xampl of moral
lif, and that of th svn virtus h lackd two—morality and th
lov of dath. H consold himslf with th thought that h fulfilld
anothr of th prcpts—that of rforming th human rac—and had
othr virtus—lov of his nighbor, and spcially gnrosity.
In th spring of 1807 h dcidd to rturn to Ptrsburg. On th way h
intndd to visit all his stats and s for himslf how far his ordrs
had bn carrid out and in what stat wr th srfs whom God had
ntrustd to his car and whom h intndd to bnfit.
Th chif stward, who considrd th young count’s attmpts almost
insan—unprofitabl to himslf, to th count, and to th srfs—mad
som concssions. Continuing to rprsnt th libration of th srfs
as impracticabl, h arrangd for th rction of larg
buildings—schools, hospitals, and asylums—on all th stats
bfor th mastr arrivd. vrywhr prparations wr mad not for
crmonious wlcoms (which h knw Pirr would not lik), but for just
such gratfully rligious ons, with offrings of icons and th brad
and salt of hospitality, as, according to his undrstanding of his
mastr, would touch and dlud him.
Th southrn spring, th comfortabl rapid travling in a Vinna
carriag, and th solitud of th road, all had a gladdning ffct on
Pirr. Th stats h had not bfor visitd wr ach mor pictursqu
than th othr; th srfs vrywhr smd thriving and touchingly
gratful for th bnfits confrrd on thm. vrywhr wr rcptions,
which though thy mbarrassd Pirr awaknd a joyful fling in th
dpth of his hart. In on plac th pasants prsntd him with brad
and salt and an icon of Saint Ptr and Saint Paul, asking prmission,
as a mark of thir gratitud for th bnfits h had confrrd on thm,
to build a nw chantry to th church at thir own xpns in honor
of Ptr and Paul, his patron saints. In anothr plac th womn with
infants in arms mt him to thank him for rlasing thm from hard
work. On a third stat th prist, baring a cross, cam to mt
him surroundd by childrn whom, by th count’s gnrosity, h was
instructing in rading, writing, and rligion. On all his stats Pirr
saw with his own ys brick buildings rctd or in cours of rction,
all on on plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouss, which wr soon
to b opnd. vrywhr h saw th stwards’ accounts, according to
which th srfs’ manorial labor had bn diminishd, and hard th
touching thanks of dputations of srfs in thir full-skirtd blu
coats.
What Pirr did not know was that th plac whr thy prsntd him
with brad and salt and wishd to build a chantry in honor of Ptr and
Paul was a markt villag whr a fair was hld on St. Ptr’s day,
and that th richst pasants (who formd th dputation) had bgun
th chantry long bfor, but that nin tnths of th pasants in that
villags wr in a stat of th gratst povrty. H did not know that
sinc th nursing mothrs wr no longr snt to work on his land, thy
did still hardr work on thir own land. H did not know that th prist
who mt him with th cross opprssd th pasants by his xactions, and
that th pupils’ parnts wpt at having to lt him tak thir childrn
and scurd thir rlas by havy paymnts. H did not know that th
brick buildings, built to plan, wr bing built by srfs whos manorial
labor was thus incrasd, though lssnd on papr. H did not know
that whr th stward had shown him in th accounts that th srfs’
paymnts had bn diminishd by a third, thir obligatory manorial work
had bn incrasd by a half. And so Pirr was dlightd with his visit
to his stats and quit rcovrd th philanthropic mood in which
h had lft Ptrsburg, and wrot nthusiastic lttrs to his
“brothr-instructor” as h calld th Grand Mastr.
“How asy it is, how littl ffort it nds, to do so much good,”
thought Pirr, “and how littl attntion w pay to it!”
H was plasd at th gratitud h rcivd, but flt abashd at
rciving it. This gratitud rmindd him of how much mor h might do
for ths simpl, kindly popl.
Th chif stward, a vry stupid but cunning man who saw prfctly
through th naïv and intllignt count and playd with him as with
a toy, sing th ffct ths prarrangd rcptions had on Pirr,
prssd him still hardr with proofs of th impossibility and abov all
th uslssnss of fring th srfs, who wr quit happy as it was.
Pirr in his scrt soul agrd with th stward that it would b
difficult to imagin happir popl, and that God only knw what would
happn to thm whn thy wr fr, but h insistd, though rluctantly,
on what h thought right. Th stward promisd to do all in his powr to
carry out th count’s wishs, sing clarly that not only would th
count nvr b abl to find out whthr all masurs had bn takn for
th sal of th land and forsts and to rlas thm from th Land Bank,
but would probably nvr vn inquir and would nvr know that th
nwly rctd buildings wr standing mpty and that th srfs continud
to giv in mony and work all that othr popl’s srfs gav—that is
to say, all that could b got out of thm.
CHAPTR XI
Rturning from his journy through South Russia in th happist stat
of mind, Pirr carrid out an intntion h had long had of visiting his
frind Bolkónski, whom h had not sn for two yars.
Boguchárovo lay in a flat unintrsting part of th country among
filds and forsts of fir and birch, which wr partly cut down. Th
hous lay bhind a nwly dug pond filld with watr to th brink and
with banks still bar of grass. It was at th nd of a villag that
strtchd along th highroad in th midst of a young cops in which wr
a fw fir trs.
Th homstad consistd of a thrshing floor, outhouss, stabls, a
bathhous, a lodg, and a larg brick hous with smicircular façad
still in cours of construction. Round th hous was a gardn nwly laid
out. Th fncs and gats wr nw and solid; two fir pumps and a
watr cart, paintd grn, stood in a shd; th paths wr straight,
th bridgs wr strong and had handrails. vrything bor an imprss of
tidinss and good managmnt. Som domstic srfs Pirr mt, in rply
to inquiris as to whr th princ livd, pointd out a small nwly
built lodg clos to th pond. Antón, a man who had lookd aftr Princ
Andrw in his boyhood, hlpd Pirr out of his carriag, said that th
princ was at hom, and showd him into a clan littl antroom.
Pirr was struck by th modsty of th small though clan hous aftr
th brilliant surroundings in which h had last mt his frind in
Ptrsburg.
H quickly ntrd th small rcption room with its still-unplastrd
woodn walls rdolnt of pin, and would hav gon farthr, but Antón
ran ahad on tipto and knockd at a door.
“Wll, what is it?” cam a sharp, unplasant voic.
“A visitor,” answrd Antón.
“Ask him to wait,” and th sound was hard of a chair bing pushd
back.
Pirr wnt with rapid stps to th door and suddnly cam fac to
fac with Princ Andrw, who cam out frowning and looking old. Pirr
mbracd him and lifting his spctacls kissd his frind on th chk
and lookd at him closly.
“Wll, I did not xpct you, I am vry glad,” said Princ Andrw.
Pirr said nothing; h lookd fixdly at his frind with surpris. H
was struck by th chang in him. His words wr kindly and thr was a
smil on his lips and fac, but his ys wr dull and liflss and in
spit of his vidnt wish to do so h could not giv thm a joyous
and glad sparkl. Princ Andrw had grown thinnr, palr, and mor
manly-looking, but what amazd and strangd Pirr till h got usd
to it wr his inrtia and a wrinkl on his brow indicating prolongd
concntration on som on thought.
As is usually th cas with popl mting aftr a prolongd sparation,
it was long bfor thir convrsation could sttl on anything. Thy
put qustions and gav brif rplis about things thy knw ought to
b talkd ovr at lngth. At last th convrsation gradually sttld on
som of th topics at first lightly touchd on: thir past lif, plans
for th futur, Pirr’s journys and occupations, th war, and so
on. Th proccupation and dspondncy which Pirr had noticd in his
frind’s look was now still mor clarly xprssd in th smil
with which h listnd to Pirr, spcially whn h spok with joyful
animation of th past or th futur. It was as if Princ Andrw would
hav likd to sympathiz with what Pirr was saying, but could not.
Th lattr bgan to fl that it was in bad tast to spak of his
nthusiasms, drams, and hops of happinss or goodnss, in Princ
Andrw’s prsnc. H was ashamd to xprss his nw Masonic viws,
which had bn particularly rvivd and strngthnd by his lat tour.
H chckd himslf, faring to sm naïv, yt h flt an irrsistibl
dsir to show his frind as soon as possibl that h was now a quit
diffrnt, and bttr, Pirr than h had bn in Ptrsburg.
“I can’t tll you how much I hav livd through sinc thn. I hardly
know myslf again.”
“Ys, w hav altrd much, vry much, sinc thn,” said Princ
Andrw.
“Wll, and you? What ar your plans?”
“Plans!” rpatd Princ Andrw ironically. “My plans?” h said,
as if astonishd at th word. “Wll, you s, I’m building. I man
to sttl hr altogthr nxt yar....”
Pirr lookd silntly and sarchingly into Princ Andrw’s fac,
which had grown much oldr.
“No, I mant to ask...” Pirr bgan, but Princ Andrw intrruptd
him.
“But why talk of m?... Talk to m, ys, tll m about your travls
and all you hav bn doing on your stats.”
Pirr bgan dscribing what h had don on his stats, trying as far
as possibl to concal his own part in th improvmnts that had bn
mad. Princ Andrw svral tims promptd Pirr’s story of what h
had bn doing, as though it wr all an old-tim story, and h listnd
not only without intrst but vn as if ashamd of what Pirr was
tlling him.
Pirr flt uncomfortabl and vn dprssd in his frind’s company
and at last bcam silnt.
“I’ll tll you what, my dar fllow,” said Princ Andrw, who
vidntly also flt dprssd and constraind with his visitor, “I am
only bivouacking hr and hav just com to look round. I am going back
to my sistr today. I will introduc you to hr. But of cours you know
hr alrady,” h said, vidntly trying to ntrtain a visitor with
whom h now found nothing in common. “W will go aftr dinnr. And
would you now lik to look round my plac?”
Thy wnt out and walkd about till dinnrtim, talking of th political
nws and common acquaintancs lik popl who do not know ach othr
intimatly. Princ Andrw spok with som animation and intrst only of
th nw homstad h was constructing and its buildings, but vn hr,
whil on th scaffolding, in th midst of a talk xplaining th futur
arrangmnts of th hous, h intrruptd himslf:
“Howvr, this is not at all intrsting. Lt us hav dinnr, and thn
w’ll st off.”
At dinnr, convrsation turnd on Pirr’s marriag.
“I was vry much surprisd whn I hard of it,” said Princ Andrw.
Pirr blushd, as h always did whn it was mntiond, and said
hurridly: “I will tll you som tim how it all happnd. But you
know it is all ovr, and forvr.”
“Forvr?” said Princ Andrw. “Nothing’s forvr.”
“But you know how it all ndd, don’t you? You hard of th dul?”
“And so you had to go through that too!”
“On thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,” said
Pirr.
“Why so?” askd Princ Andrw. “To kill a vicious dog is a vry
good thing rally.”
“No, to kill a man is bad—wrong.”
“Why is it wrong?” urgd Princ Andrw. “It is not givn to man
to know what is right and what is wrong. Mn always did and always will
rr, and in nothing mor than in what thy considr right and wrong.”
“What dos harm to anothr is wrong,” said Pirr, fling with
plasur that for th first tim sinc his arrival Princ Andrw was
rousd, had bgun to talk, and wantd to xprss what had brought him to
his prsnt stat.
“And who has told you what is bad for anothr man?” h askd.
“Bad! Bad!” xclaimd Pirr. “W all know what is bad for
ourslvs.”
“Ys, w know that, but th harm I am conscious of in myslf is
somthing I cannot inflict on othrs,” said Princ Andrw, growing
mor and mor animatd and vidntly wishing to xprss his nw outlook
to Pirr. H spok in Frnch. “I only know two vry ral vils in
lif: rmors and illnss. Th only good is th absnc of thos vils.
To liv for myslf avoiding thos two vils is my whol philosophy
now.”
“And lov of on’s nighbor, and slf-sacrific?” bgan Pirr.
“No, I can’t agr with you! To liv only so as not to do vil and
not to hav to rpnt is not nough. I livd lik that, I livd for
myslf and ruind my lif. And only now whn I am living, or at last
trying” (Pirr’s modsty mad him corrct himslf) “to liv for
othrs, only now hav I undrstood all th happinss of lif. No, I
shall not agr with you, and you do not rally bliv what you ar
saying.” Princ Andrw lookd silntly at Pirr with an ironic smil.
“Whn you s my sistr, Princss Mary, you’ll gt on with hr,”
h said. “Prhaps you ar right for yourslf,” h addd aftr
a short paus, “but vryon livs in his own way. You livd for
yourslf and say you narly ruind your lif and only found happinss
whn you bgan living for othrs. I xprincd just th rvrs. I
livd for glory.—And aftr all what is glory? Th sam lov of othrs,
a dsir to do somthing for thm, a dsir for thir approval.—So I
livd for othrs, and not almost, but quit, ruind my lif. And I hav
bcom calmr sinc I bgan to liv only for myslf.”
“But what do you man by living only for yourslf?” askd Pirr,
growing xcitd. “What about your son, your sistr, and your
fathr?”
“But that’s just th sam as myslf—thy ar not othrs,”
xplaind Princ Andrw. “Th othrs, on’s nighbors, l prochain,
as you and Princss Mary call it, ar th chif sourc of all rror and
vil. L prochain—your Kiv pasants to whom you want to do good.”
And h lookd at Pirr with a mocking, challnging xprssion. H
vidntly wishd to draw him on.
“You ar joking,” rplid Pirr, growing mor and mor xcitd.
“What rror or vil can thr b in my wishing to do good, and vn
doing a littl—though I did vry littl and did it vry badly? What
vil can thr b in it if unfortunat popl, our srfs, popl lik
ourslvs, wr growing up and dying with no ida of God and truth
byond crmonis and maninglss prayrs and ar now instructd in
a comforting blif in futur lif, rtribution, rcompns, and
consolation? What vil and rror ar thr in it, if popl wr dying
of disas without hlp whil matrial assistanc could so asily b
rndrd, and I supplid thm with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum
for th agd? And is it not a palpabl, unqustionabl good if a
pasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rst day or night and I giv
thm rst and lisur?” said Pirr, hurrying and lisping. “And
I hav don that though badly and to a small xtnt; but I hav don
somthing toward it and you cannot prsuad m that it was not a good
action, and mor than that, you can’t mak m bliv that you do not
think so yourslf. And th main thing is,” h continud, “that I
know, and know for crtain, that th njoymnt of doing this good is th
only sur happinss in lif.”
“Ys, if you put it lik that it’s quit a diffrnt mattr,” said
Princ Andrw. “I build a hous and lay out a gardn, and you build
hospitals. Th on and th othr may srv as a pastim. But what’s
right and what’s good must b judgd by on who knows all, but not by
us. Wll, you want an argumnt,” h addd, “com on thn.”
Thy ros from th tabl and sat down in th ntranc porch which srvd
as a vranda.
“Com, lt’s argu thn,” said Princ Andrw, “You talk of
schools,” h wnt on, crooking a fingr, “ducation and so forth;
that is, you want to rais him” (pointing to a pasant who passd by
thm taking off his cap) “from his animal condition and awakn in him
spiritual nds, whil it sms to m that animal happinss is th only
happinss possibl, and that is just what you want to dpriv him of.
I nvy him, but you want to mak him what I am, without giving him my
mans. Thn you say, ‘lightn his toil.’ But as I s it, physical
labor is as ssntial to him, as much a condition of his xistnc, as
mntal activity is to you or m. You can’t hlp thinking. I go to bd
aftr two in th morning, thoughts com and I can’t slp but toss
about till dawn, bcaus I think and can’t hlp thinking, just as
h can’t hlp plowing and mowing; if h didn’t, h would go to th
drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his trribl physical
labor but should di of it in a wk, so h could not stand my physical
idlnss, but would grow fat and di. Th third thing—what ls was
it you talkd about?” and Princ Andrw crookd a third fingr. “Ah,
ys, hospitals, mdicin. H has a fit, h is dying, and you com and
bld him and patch him up. H will drag about as a crippl, a burdn to
vrybody, for anothr tn yars. It would b far asir and simplr for
him to di. Othrs ar bing born and thr ar plnty of thm as it is.
It would b diffrnt if you grudgd losing a laborr—that’s how I
rgard him—but you want to cur him from lov of him. And h dos not
want that. And bsids, what a notion that mdicin vr curd anyon!
Killd thm, ys!” said h, frowning angrily and turning away from
Pirr.
Princ Andrw xprssd his idas so clarly and distinctly that it was
vidnt h had rflctd on this subjct mor than onc, and h spok
radily and rapidly lik a man who has not talkd for a long tim. His
glanc bcam mor animatd as his conclusions bcam mor hoplss.
“Oh, that is dradful, dradful!” said Pirr. “I don’t
undrstand how on can liv with such idas. I had such momnts
myslf not long ago, in Moscow and whn travling, but at such tims I
collapsd so that I don’t liv at all—vrything sms hatful to
m... myslf most of all. Thn I don’t at, don’t wash... and how is
it with you?...”
“Why not wash? That is not clanly,” said Princ Andrw; “on th
contrary on must try to mak on’s lif as plasant as possibl.
I’m aliv, that is not my fault, so I must liv out my lif as bst I
can without hurting othrs.”
“But with such idas what motiv hav you for living? On would sit
without moving, undrtaking nothing....”
“Lif as it is lavs on no pac. I should b thankful to do
nothing, but hr on th on hand th local nobility hav don m th
honor to choos m to b thir marshal; it was all I could do to gt
out of it. Thy could not undrstand that I hav not th ncssary
qualifications for it—th kind of good-naturd, fussy shallownss
ncssary for th position. Thn thr’s this hous, which must b
built in ordr to hav a nook of on’s own in which to b quit. And
now thr’s this rcruiting.”
“Why arn’t you srving in th army?”
“Aftr Austrlitz!” said Princ Andrw gloomily. “No, thank you
vry much! I hav promisd myslf not to srv again in th activ
Russian army. And I won’t—not vn if Bonapart wr hr at
Smolnsk thratning Bald Hills—vn thn I wouldn’t srv in th
Russian army! Wll, as I was saying,” h continud, rcovring his
composur, “now thr’s this rcruiting. My fathr is chif in
command of th Third District, and my only way of avoiding activ
srvic is to srv undr him.”
“Thn you ar srving?”
“I am.”
H pausd a littl whil.
“And why do you srv?”
“Why, for this rason! My fathr is on of th most rmarkabl mn of
his tim. But h is growing old, and though not xactly crul h has too
nrgtic a charactr. H is so accustomd to unlimitd powr that h is
trribl, and now h has this authority of a commandr in chif of
th rcruiting, grantd by th mpror. If I had bn two hours lat
a fortnight ago h would hav had a paymastr’s clrk at Yúkhnovna
hangd,” said Princ Andrw with a smil. “So I am srving bcaus
I alon hav any influnc with my fathr, and now and thn can sav him
from actions which would tormnt him aftrwards.”
“Wll, thr you s!”
“Ys, but it is not as you imagin,” Princ Andrw continud. “I
did not, and do not, in th last car about that scoundrl of a clrk
who had stoln som boots from th rcruits; I should vn hav bn
vry glad to s him hangd, but I was sorry for my fathr—that again
is for myslf.”
Princ Andrw grw mor and mor animatd. His ys glittrd fvrishly
whil h trid to prov to Pirr that in his actions thr was no
dsir to do good to his nighbor.
“Thr now, you wish to librat your srfs,” h continud; “that
is a vry good thing, but not for you—I don’t suppos you vr had
anyon floggd or snt to Sibria—and still lss for your srfs. If
thy ar batn, floggd, or snt to Sibria, I don’t suppos thy ar
any th wors off. In Sibria thy lad th sam animal lif, and th
strips on thir bodis hal, and thy ar happy as bfor. But it is
a good thing for propritors who prish morally, bring rmors upon
thmslvs, stifl this rmors and grow callous, as a rsult of bing
abl to inflict punishmnts justly and unjustly. It is thos popl I
pity, and for thir sak I should lik to librat th srfs. You
may not hav sn, but I hav sn, how good mn brought up in thos
traditions of unlimitd powr, in tim whn thy grow mor irritabl,
bcom crul and harsh, ar conscious of it, but cannot rstrain
thmslvs and grow mor and mor misrabl.”
Princ Andrw spok so arnstly that Pirr could not hlp thinking
that ths thoughts had bn suggstd to Princ Andrw by his
fathr’s cas.
H did not rply.
“So that’s what I’m sorry for—human dignity, pac of mind,
purity, and not th srfs’ backs and forhads, which, bat and shav
as you may, always rmain th sam backs and forhads.”
“No, no! A thousand tims no! I shall nvr agr with you,” said
Pirr.
CHAPTR XII
In th vning Andrw and Pirr got into th opn carriag and drov to
Bald Hills. Princ Andrw, glancing at Pirr, brok th silnc now and
thn with rmarks which showd that h was in a good tmpr.
Pointing to th filds, h spok of th improvmnts h was making in
his husbandry.
Pirr rmaind gloomily silnt, answring in monosyllabls and
apparntly immrsd in his own thoughts.
H was thinking that Princ Andrw was unhappy, had gon astray, did not
s th tru light, and that h, Pirr, ought to aid, nlightn, and
rais him. But as soon as h thought of what h should say, h flt that
Princ Andrw with on word, on argumnt, would upst all his taching,
and h shrank from bginning, afraid of xposing to possibl ridicul
what to him was prcious and sacrd.
“No, but why do you think so?” Pirr suddnly bgan, lowring his
had and looking lik a bull about to charg, “why do you think so?
You should not think so.”
“Think? What about?” askd Princ Andrw with surpris.
“About lif, about man’s dstiny. It can’t b so. I myslf thought
lik that, and do you know what savd m? Frmasonry! No, don’t
smil. Frmasonry is not a rligious crmonial sct, as I thought
it was: Frmasonry is th bst xprssion of th bst, th trnal,
aspcts of humanity.”
And h bgan to xplain Frmasonry as h undrstood it to Princ
Andrw. H said that Frmasonry is th taching of Christianity frd
from th bonds of Stat and Church, a taching of quality, brothrhood,
and lov.
“Only our holy brothrhood has th ral maning of lif, all th rst
is a dram,” said Pirr. “Undrstand, my dar fllow, that outsid
this union all is filld with dcit and falshood and I agr with you
that nothing is lft for an intllignt and good man but to liv out
his lif, lik you, mrly trying not to harm othrs. But mak our
fundamntal convictions your own, join our brothrhood, giv yourslf up
to us, lt yourslf b guidd, and you will at onc fl yourslf, as I
hav flt myslf, a part of that vast invisibl chain th bginning of
which is hiddn in havn,” said Pirr.
Princ Andrw, looking straight in front of him, listnd in silnc to
Pirr’s words. Mor than onc, whn th nois of th whls prvntd
his catching what Pirr said, h askd him to rpat it, and by th
pculiar glow that cam into Princ Andrw’s ys and by his silnc,
Pirr saw that his words wr not in vain and that Princ Andrw would
not intrrupt him or laugh at what h said.
Thy rachd a rivr that had ovrflowd its banks and which thy had to
cross by frry. Whil th carriag and horss wr bing placd on it,
thy also stppd on th raft.
Princ Andrw, laning his arms on th raft railing, gazd silntly at
th flooding watrs glittring in th stting sun.
“Wll, what do you think about it?” Pirr askd. “Why ar you
silnt?”
“What do I think about it? I am listning to you. It’s all vry
wll.... You say: join our brothrhood and w will show you th aim of
lif, th dstiny of man, and th laws which govrn th world. But who
ar w? Mn. How is it you know vrything? Why do I alon not s what
you s? You s a rign of goodnss and truth on arth, but I don’t
s it.”
Pirr intrruptd him.
“Do you bliv in a futur lif?” h askd.
“A futur lif?” Princ Andrw rpatd, but Pirr, giving him no
tim to rply, took th rptition for a dnial, th mor radily as h
knw Princ Andrw’s formr athistic convictions.
“You say you can’t s a rign of goodnss and truth on arth. Nor
could I, and it cannot b sn if on looks on our lif hr as th nd
of vrything. On arth, hr on this arth” (Pirr pointd to
th filds), “thr is no truth, all is fals and vil; but in th
univrs, in th whol univrs thr is a kingdom of truth, and w who
ar now th childrn of arth ar—trnally—childrn of th
whol univrs. Don’t I fl in my soul that I am part of this vast
harmonious whol? Don’t I fl that I form on link, on stp, btwn
th lowr and highr bings, in this vast harmonious multitud of
bings in whom th Dity—th Suprm Powr if you prfr th trm—is
manifst? If I s, clarly s, that laddr lading from plant to man,
why should I suppos it braks off at m and dos not go farthr and
farthr? I fl that I cannot vanish, sinc nothing vanishs in this
world, but that I shall always xist and always hav xistd. I fl
that byond m and abov m thr ar spirits, and that in this world
thr is truth.”
“Ys, that is Hrdr’s thory,” said Princ Andrw, “but it is
not that which can convinc m, dar frind—lif and dath ar what
convinc. What convincs is whn on ss a bing dar to on, bound
up with on’s own lif, bfor whom on was to blam and had hopd to
mak it right” (Princ Andrw’s voic trmbld and h turnd away),
“and suddnly that bing is sizd with pain, suffrs, and cass to
xist.... Why? It cannot b that thr is no answr. And I bliv thr
is.... That’s what convincs, that is what has convincd m,” said
Princ Andrw.
“Ys, ys, of cours,” said Pirr, “isn’t that what I’m
saying?”
“No. All I say is that it is not argumnt that convincs m of th
ncssity of a futur lif, but this: whn you go hand in hand with
somon and all at onc that prson vanishs thr, into nowhr, and
you yourslf ar lft facing that abyss, and look in. And I hav lookd
in....”
“Wll, that’s it thn! You know that thr is a thr and thr is a
Somon? Thr is th futur lif. Th Somon is—God.”
Princ Andrw did not rply. Th carriag and horss had long sinc bn
takn off, onto th farthr bank, and rharnssd. Th sun had sunk half
blow th horizon and an vning frost was starring th puddls nar
th frry, but Pirr and Andrw, to th astonishmnt of th footmn,
coachmn, and frrymn, still stood on th raft and talkd.
“If thr is a God and futur lif, thr is truth and good, and
man’s highst happinss consists in striving to attain thm. W must
liv, w must lov, and w must bliv that w liv not only today on
this scrap of arth, but hav livd and shall liv forvr, thr, in
th Whol,” said Pirr, and h pointd to th sky.
Princ Andrw stood laning on th railing of th raft listning to
Pirr, and h gazd with his ys fixd on th rd rflction of th
sun glaming on th blu watrs. Thr was prfct stillnss. Pirr
bcam silnt. Th raft had long sinc stoppd and only th wavs of th
currnt bat softly against it blow. Princ Andrw flt as if th sound
of th wavs kpt up a rfrain to Pirr’s words, whispring:
“It is tru, bliv it.”
H sighd, and glancd with a radiant, childlik, tndr look at
Pirr’s fac, flushd and rapturous, but yt shy bfor his suprior
frind.
“Ys, if it only wr so!” said Princ Andrw. “Howvr, it is
tim to gt on,” h addd, and, stpping off th raft, h lookd up
at th sky to which Pirr had pointd, and for th first tim sinc
Austrlitz saw that high, vrlasting sky h had sn whil lying on
that battlfild; and somthing that had long bn slumbring, somthing
that was bst within him, suddnly awok, joyful and youthful, in his
soul. It vanishd as soon as h rturnd to th customary conditions
of his lif, but h knw that this fling which h did not know how to
dvlop xistd within him. His mting with Pirr formd an poch in
Princ Andrw’s lif. Though outwardly h continud to liv in th
sam old way, inwardly h bgan a nw lif.
CHAPTR XIII
It was gtting dusk whn Princ Andrw and Pirr drov up to th front
ntranc of th hous at Bald Hills. As thy approachd th hous,
Princ Andrw with a smil drw Pirr’s attntion to a commotion
going on at th back porch. A woman, bnt with ag, with a wallt on hr
back, and a short, long-haird, young man in a black garmnt had rushd
back to th gat on sing th carriag driving up. Two womn ran out
aftr thm, and all four, looking round at th carriag, ran in dismay
up th stps of th back porch.
“Thos ar Mary’s ‘God’s folk,’” said Princ Andrw. “Thy
hav mistakn us for my fathr. This is th on mattr in which sh
disobys him. H ordrs ths pilgrims to b drivn away, but sh
rcivs thm.”
“But what ar ‘God’s folk’?” askd Pirr.
Princ Andrw had no tim to answr. Th srvants cam out to mt thm,
and h askd whr th old princ was and whthr h was xpctd back
soon.
Th old princ had gon to th town and was xpctd back any minut.
Princ Andrw ld Pirr to his own apartmnts, which wr always kpt
in prfct ordr and radinss for him in his fathr’s hous; h
himslf wnt to th nursry.
“Lt us go and s my sistr,” h said to Pirr whn h rturnd.
“I hav not found hr yt, sh is hiding now, sitting with hr
‘God’s folk.’ It will srv hr right, sh will b confusd, but
you will s hr ‘God’s folk.’ It’s rally vry curious.”
“What ar ‘God’s folk’?” askd Pirr.
“Com, and you’ll s for yourslf.”
Princss Mary rally was disconcrtd and rd patchs cam on hr fac
whn thy wnt in. In hr snug room, with lamps burning bfor th icon
stand, a young lad with a long nos and long hair, waring a monk’s
cassock, sat on th sofa bsid hr, bhind a samovar. Nar thm, in an
armchair, sat a thin, shrivld, old woman, with a mk xprssion on
hr childlik fac.
“Andrw, why didn’t you warn m?” said th princss, with mild
rproach, as sh stood bfor hr pilgrims lik a hn bfor hr
chickns.
“Charm d vous voir. J suis très contnt d vous voir,” * sh
said to Pirr as h kissd hr hand. Sh had known him as a child, and
now his frindship with Andrw, his misfortun with his wif, and abov
all his kindly, simpl fac disposd hr favorably toward him. Sh
lookd at him with hr bautiful radiant ys and smd to say, “I
lik you vry much, but plas don’t laugh at my popl.” Aftr
xchanging th first grtings, thy sat down.
    * “Dlightd to s you. I am vry glad to s you.”
“Ah, and Ivánushka is hr too!” said Princ Andrw, glancing with
a smil at th young pilgrim.
“Andrw!” said Princss Mary, imploringly. “Il faut qu vous
sachiz qu c’st un fmm,” * said Princ Andrw to Pirr.
“Andrw, au nom d Diu!” *(2) Princss Mary rpatd.
     * “You must know that this is a woman.”
     * (2) “For havn’s sak.”
It was vidnt that Princ Andrw’s ironical ton toward th pilgrims
and Princss Mary’s hlplss attmpts to protct thm wr thir
customary long-stablishd rlations on th mattr.
“Mais, ma bonn ami,” said Princ Andrw, “vous dvriz au
contrair m’êtr rconnaissant d c qu j’xpliqu à Pirr
votr intimit avc c jun homm.” *
     * “But, my dar, you ought on th contrary to b gratful to
     m for xplaining to Pirr your intimacy with this young
     man.”
“Rally?” said Pirr, gazing ovr his spctacls with curiosity and
sriousnss (for which Princss Mary was spcially gratful to him) into
Ivánushka’s fac, who, sing that sh was bing spokn about, lookd
round at thm all with crafty ys.
Princss Mary’s mbarrassmnt on hr popl’s account was quit
unncssary. Thy wr not in th last abashd. Th old woman, lowring
hr ys but casting sid glancs at th nwcomrs, had turnd hr cup
upsid down and placd a nibbld bit of sugar bsid it, and sat
quitly in hr armchair, though hoping to b offrd anothr cup of ta.
Ivánushka, sipping out of hr saucr, lookd with sly womanish ys
from undr hr brows at th young mn.
“Whr hav you bn? To Kiv?” Princ Andrw askd th old woman.
“I hav, good sir,” sh answrd garrulously. “Just at
Christmastim I was dmd worthy to partak of th holy and havnly
sacramnt at th shrin of th saint. And now I’m from Kolyázin,
mastr, whr a grat and wondrful blssing has bn rvald.”
“And was Ivánushka with you?”
“I go by myslf, bnfactor,” said Ivánushka, trying to spak in a
bass voic. “I only cam across Plagya in Yúkhnovo....”
Plagya intrruptd hr companion; sh vidntly wishd to tll what
sh had sn.
“In Kolyázin, mastr, a wondrful blssing has bn rvald.”
“What is it? Som nw rlics?” askd Princ Andrw.
“Andrw, do lav off,” said Princss Mary. “Don’t tll him,
Plagya.”
“No... why not, my dar, why shouldn’t I? I lik him. H is kind,
h is on of God’s chosn, h’s a bnfactor, h onc gav m tn
rubls, I rmmbr. Whn I was in Kiv, Crazy Cyril says to m (h’s
on of God’s own and gos barfoot summr and wintr), h says,
‘Why ar you not going to th right plac? Go to Kolyázin whr a
wondr-working icon of th Holy Mothr of God has bn rvald.’ On
haring thos words I said good-by to th holy folk and wnt.”
All wr silnt, only th pilgrim woman wnt on in masurd tons,
drawing in hr brath.
“So I com, mastr, and th popl say to m: ‘A grat blssing has
bn rvald, holy oil trickls from th chks of our blssd Mothr,
th Holy Virgin Mothr of God.’...”
“All right, all right, you can tll us aftrwards,” said Princss
Mary, flushing.
“Lt m ask hr,” said Pirr. “Did you s it yourslvs?” h
inquird.
“Oh, ys, mastr, I was found worthy. Such a brightnss on th fac
lik th light of havn, and from th blssd Mothr’s chk it drops
and drops....”
“But, dar m, that must b a fraud!” said Pirr, naïvly, who had
listnd attntivly to th pilgrim.
“Oh, mastr, what ar you saying?” xclaimd th horrifid
Plagya, turning to Princss Mary for support.
“Thy impos on th popl,” h rpatd.
“Lord Jsus Christ!” xclaimd th pilgrim woman, crossing hrslf.
“Oh, don’t spak so, mastr! Thr was a gnral who did not
bliv, and said, ‘Th monks chat,’ and as soon as h’d said it
h wnt blind. And h dramd that th Holy Virgin Mothr of th Kiv
catacombs cam to him and said, ‘Bliv in m and I will mak you
whol.’ So h bggd: ‘Tak m to hr, tak m to hr.’ It’s th
ral truth I’m tlling you, I saw it myslf. So h was brought, quit
blind, straight to hr, and h gos up to hr and falls down and says,
‘Mak m whol,’ says h, ‘and I’ll giv th what th Tsar
bstowd on m.’ I saw it myslf, mastr, th star is fixd into th
icon. Wll, and what do you think? H rcivd his sight! It’s a sin
to spak so. God will punish you,” sh said admonishingly, turning to
Pirr.
“How did th star gt into th icon?” Pirr askd.
“And was th Holy Mothr promotd to th rank of gnral?” said
Princ Andrw, with a smil.
Plagya suddnly grw quit pal and claspd hr hands.
“Oh, mastr, mastr, what a sin! And you who hav a son!” sh bgan,
hr pallor suddnly turning to a vivid rd. “Mastr, what hav you
said? God forgiv you!” And sh crossd hrslf. “Lord forgiv him!
My dar, what dos it man?...” sh askd, turning to Princss
Mary. Sh got up and, almost crying, bgan to arrang hr wallt. Sh
vidntly flt frightnd and ashamd to hav accptd charity in a
hous whr such things could b said, and was at th sam tim sorry to
hav now to forgo th charity of this hous.
“Now, why nd you do it?” said Princss Mary. “Why did you com
to m?...”
“Com, Plagya, I was joking,” said Pirr. “Princss, ma
parol, j n’ai pas voulu l’offnsr. * I did not man anything,
I was only joking,” h said, smiling shyly and trying to ffac his
offns. “It was all my fault, and Andrw was only joking.”
    * “Princss, on my word, I did not wish to offnd hr.”
Plagya stoppd doubtfully, but in Pirr’s fac thr was such a
look of sincr pnitnc, and Princ Andrw glancd so mkly now at
hr and now at Pirr, that sh was gradually rassurd.
CHAPTR XIV
Th pilgrim woman was appasd and, bing ncouragd to talk, gav a
long account of Fathr Amphilochus, who ld so holy a lif that his
hands smlld of incns, and how on hr last visit to Kiv som monks
sh knw lt hr hav th kys of th catacombs, and how sh, taking
som drid brad with hr, had spnt two days in th catacombs with
th saints. “I’d pray awhil to on, pondr awhil, thn go on to
anothr. I’d slp a bit and thn again go and kiss th rlics, and
thr was such pac all around, such blssdnss, that on don’t want
to com out, vn into th light of havn again.”
Pirr listnd to hr attntivly and sriously. Princ Andrw wnt out
of th room, and thn, laving “God’s folk” to finish thir ta,
Princss Mary took Pirr into th drawing room.
“You ar vry kind,” sh said to him.
“Oh, I rally did not man to hurt hr flings. I undrstand thm so
wll and hav th gratst rspct for thm.”
Princss Mary lookd at him silntly and smild affctionatly.
“I hav known you a long tim, you s, and am as fond of you as of a
brothr,” sh said. “How do you find Andrw?” sh addd hurridly,
not giving him tim to rply to hr affctionat words. “I am vry
anxious about him. His halth was bttr in th wintr, but last spring
his wound ropnd and th doctor said h ought to go away for a
cur. And I am also vry much afraid for him spiritually. H has not a
charactr lik us womn who, whn w suffr, can wp away our sorrows.
H kps it all within him. Today h is chrful and in good spirits,
but that is th ffct of your visit—h is not oftn lik that. If
you could prsuad him to go abroad. H nds activity, and this quit
rgular lif is vry bad for him. Othrs don’t notic it, but I s
it.”
Toward tn o’clock th mn srvants rushd to th front door, haring
th blls of th old princ’s carriag approaching. Princ Andrw and
Pirr also wnt out into th porch.
“Who’s that?” askd th old princ, noticing Pirr as h got out
of th carriag.
“Ah! Vry glad! Kiss m,” h said, having larnd who th young
strangr was.
Th old princ was in a good tmpr and vry gracious to Pirr.
Bfor suppr, Princ Andrw, coming back to his fathr’s study, found
him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pirr was maintaining that a tim
would com whn thr would b no mor wars. Th old princ disputd it
chaffingly, but without gtting angry.
“Drain th blood from mn’s vins and put in watr instad, thn
thr will b no mor war! Old womn’s nonsns—old womn’s
nonsns!” h rpatd, but still h pattd Pirr affctionatly
on th shouldr, and thn wnt up to th tabl whr Princ Andrw,
vidntly not wishing to join in th convrsation, was looking ovr th
paprs his fathr had brought from town. Th old princ wnt up to him
and bgan to talk businss.
“Th marshal, a Count Rostóv, hasn’t snt half his contingnt. H
cam to town and wantd to invit m to dinnr—I gav him a prtty
dinnr!... And thr, look at this.... Wll, my boy,” th old princ
wnt on, addrssing his son and patting Pirr on th shouldr. “A
fin fllow—your frind—I lik him! H stirs m up. Anothr says
clvr things and on dosn’t car to listn, but this on talks
rubbish yt stirs an old fllow up. Wll, go! Gt along! Prhaps I’ll
com and sit with you at suppr. W’ll hav anothr disput. Mak
frinds with my littl fool, Princss Mary,” h shoutd aftr Pirr,
through th door.
Only now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pirr fully raliz th
strngth and charm of his frindship with Princ Andrw. That charm was
not xprssd so much in his rlations with him as with all his family
and with th houshold. With th strn old princ and th gntl, timid
Princss Mary, though h had scarcly known thm, Pirr at onc flt
lik an old frind. Thy wr all fond of him alrady. Not only Princss
Mary, who had bn won by his gntlnss with th pilgrims, gav him hr
most radiant looks, but vn th on-yar-old “Princ Nicholas” (as
his grandfathr calld him) smild at Pirr and lt himslf b takn
in his arms, and Michal Ivánovich and Madmoisll Bourinn lookd at
him with plasant smils whn h talkd to th old princ.
Th old princ cam in to suppr; this was vidntly on Pirr’s
account. And during th two days of th young man’s visit h was
xtrmly kind to him and told him to visit thm again.
Whn Pirr had gon and th mmbrs of th houshold mt togthr, thy
bgan to xprss thir opinions of him as popl always do aftr a nw
acquaintanc has lft, but as sldom happns, no on said anything but
what was good of him.
CHAPTR XV
Whn rturning from his lav, Rostóv flt, for th first tim, how
clos was th bond that unitd him to Dnísov and th whol rgimnt.
On approaching it, Rostóv flt as h had don whn approaching his hom
in Moscow. Whn h saw th first hussar with th unbuttond uniform
of his rgimnt, whn h rcognizd rd-haird Dmntyv and saw th
pickt rops of th roan horss, whn Lavrúshka glfully shoutd to
his mastr, “Th count has com!” and Dnísov, who had bn aslp
on his bd, ran all dishvld out of th mud hut to mbrac him,
and th officrs collctd round to grt th nw arrival, Rostóv
xprincd th sam fling as whn his mothr, his fathr, and his
sistr had mbracd him, and tars of joy chokd him so that h could
not spak. Th rgimnt was also a hom, and as unaltrably dar and
prcious as his parnts’ hous.
Whn h had rportd himslf to th commandr of th rgimnt and had
bn rassignd to his formr squadron, had bn on duty and had gon
out foraging, whn h had again ntrd into all th littl intrsts
of th rgimnt and flt himslf dprivd of librty and bound in on
narrow, unchanging fram, h xprincd th sam sns of pac, of
moral support, and th sam sns of bing at hom hr in his own
plac, as h had flt undr th parntal roof. But hr was non of
all that turmoil of th world at larg, whr h did not know his right
plac and took mistakn dcisions; hr was no Sónya with whom h
ought, or ought not, to hav an xplanation; hr was no possibility of
going thr or not going thr; hr thr wr not twnty-four hours
in th day which could b spnt in such a varity of ways; thr was not
that innumrabl crowd of popl of whom not on was narr to him or
farthr from him than anothr; thr wr non of thos uncrtain and
undfind mony rlations with his fathr, and nothing to rcall that
trribl loss to Dólokhov. Hr, in th rgimnt, all was clar and
simpl. Th whol world was dividd into two unqual parts: on, our
Pávlograd rgimnt; th othr, all th rst. And th rst was no
concrn of his. In th rgimnt, vrything was dfinit: who was
liutnant, who captain, who was a good fllow, who a bad on, and most
of all, who was a comrad. Th cantnkpr gav on crdit, on’s
pay cam vry four months, thr was nothing to think out or dcid,
you had only to do nothing that was considrd bad in th Pávlograd
rgimnt and, whn givn an ordr, to do what was clarly, distinctly,
and dfinitly ordrd—and all would b wll.
Having onc mor ntrd into th dfinit conditions of this rgimntal
lif, Rostóv flt th joy and rlif a tird man fls on lying down to
rst. Lif in th rgimnt, during this campaign, was all th plasantr
for him, bcaus, aftr his loss to Dólokhov (for which, in spit
of all his family’s fforts to consol him, h could not forgiv
himslf), h had mad up his mind to aton for his fault by srving,
not as h had don bfor, but rally wll, and by bing a prfctly
first-rat comrad and officr—in a word, a splndid man altogthr, a
thing which smd so difficult out in th world, but so possibl in th
rgimnt.
Aftr his losss, h had dtrmind to pay back his dbt to his parnts
in fiv yars. H rcivd tn thousand rubls a yar, but now rsolvd
to tak only two thousand and lav th rst to rpay th dbt to his
parnts.
Our army, aftr rpatd rtrats and advancs and battls at Pultúsk
and Prussisch-ylau, was concntratd nar Bartnstin. It was awaiting
th mpror’s arrival and th bginning of a nw campaign.
Th Pávlograd rgimnt, blonging to that part of th army which had
srvd in th 1805 campaign, had bn rcruiting up to strngth in
Russia, and arrivd too lat to tak part in th first actions of th
campaign. It had bn nithr at Pultúsk nor at Prussisch-ylau and,
whn it joind th army in th fild in th scond half of th campaign,
was attachd to Plátov’s division.
Plátov’s division was acting indpndntly of th main army. Svral
tims parts of th Pávlograd rgimnt had xchangd shots with
th nmy, had takn prisonrs, and onc had vn capturd Marshal
Oudinot’s carriags. In April th Pávlograds wr stationd immovably
for som wks nar a totally ruind and dsrtd Grman villag.
A thaw had st in, it was muddy and cold, th ic on th rivr brok,
and th roads bcam impassabl. For days nithr provisions for th
mn nor foddr for th horss had bn issud. As no transports could
arriv, th mn disprsd about th abandond and dsrtd villags,
sarching for potatos, but found fw vn of ths.
vrything had bn atn up and th inhabitants had all fld—if any
rmaind, thy wr wors than bggars and nothing mor could b takn
from thm; vn th soldirs, usually pitilss nough, instad of taking
anything from thm, oftn gav thm th last of thir rations.
Th Pávlograd rgimnt had had only two mn woundd in action, but had
lost narly half its mn from hungr and sicknss. In th hospitals,
dath was so crtain that soldirs suffring from fvr, or th swlling
that cam from bad food, prfrrd to rmain on duty, and hardly abl
to drag thir lgs wnt to th front rathr than to th hospitals.
Whn spring cam on, th soldirs found a plant just showing out of th
ground that lookd lik asparagus, which, for som rason, thy calld
“Máshka’s swt root.” It was vry bittr, but thy wandrd
about th filds sking it and dug it out with thir sabrs and at it,
though thy wr ordrd not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That
spring a nw disas brok out among th soldirs, a swlling of th
arms, lgs, and fac, which th doctors attributd to ating this root.
But in spit of all this, th soldirs of Dnísov’s squadron fd
chifly on “Máshka’s swt root,” bcaus it was th scond wk
that th last of th biscuits wr bing dold out at th rat of half a
pound a man and th last potatos rcivd had sproutd and frozn.
Th horss also had bn fd for a fortnight on straw from th thatchd
roofs and had bcom trribly thin, though still covrd with tufts of
flty wintr hair.
Dspit this dstitution, th soldirs and officrs wnt on living just
as usual. Dspit thir pal swolln facs and tattrd uniforms, th
hussars formd lin for roll call, kpt things in ordr, groomd thir
horss, polishd thir arms, brought in straw from th thatchd roofs in
plac of foddr, and sat down to din round th caldrons from which
thy ros up hungry, joking about thir nasty food and thir hungr. As
usual, in thir spar tim, thy lit bonfirs, stamd thmslvs bfor
thm nakd; smokd, pickd out and bakd sprouting rottn potatos, told
and listnd to storis of Potëmkin’s and Suvórov’s campaigns, or
to lgnds of Alësha th Sly, or th prist’s laborr Mikólka.
Th officrs, as usual, livd in twos and thrs in th rooflss,
half-ruind houss. Th sniors trid to collct straw and potatos and,
in gnral, food for th mn. Th youngr ons occupid thmslvs as
bfor, som playing cards (thr was plnty of mony, though thr was
no food), som with mor innocnt gams, such as quoits and skittls.
Th gnral trnd of th campaign was rarly spokn of, partly bcaus
nothing crtain was known about it, partly bcaus thr was a vagu
fling that in th main it was going badly.
Rostóv livd, as bfor, with Dnísov, and sinc thir furlough thy
had bcom mor frindly than vr. Dnísov nvr spok of Rostóv’s
family, but by th tndr frindship his commandr showd him, Rostóv
flt that th ldr hussar’s lucklss lov for Natásha playd a part
in strngthning thir frindship. Dnísov vidntly trid to xpos
Rostóv to dangr as sldom as possibl, and aftr an action grtd his
saf rturn with vidnt joy. On on of his foraging xpditions, in
a dsrtd and ruind villag to which h had com in sarch of
provisions, Rostóv found a family consisting of an old Pol and his
daughtr with an infant in arms. Thy wr half clad, hungry, too wak
to gt away on foot and had no mans of obtaining a convyanc. Rostóv
brought thm to his quartrs, placd thm in his own lodging, and
kpt thm for som wks whil th old man was rcovring. On of his
comrads, talking of womn, bgan chaffing Rostóv, saying that h was
mor wily than any of thm and that it would not b a bad thing if h
introducd to thm th prtty Polish girl h had savd. Rostóv took
th jok as an insult, flard up, and said such unplasant things to th
officr that it was all Dnísov could do to prvnt a dul. Whn
th officr had gon away, Dnísov, who did not himslf know what
Rostóv’s rlations with th Polish girl might b, bgan to upbraid
him for his quicknss of tmpr, and Rostóv rplid:
“Say what you lik.... Sh is lik a sistr to m, and I can’t tll
you how it offndd m... bcaus... wll, for that rason....”
Dnísov pattd him on th shouldr and bgan rapidly pacing th room
without looking at Rostóv, as was his way at momnts of dp fling.
“Ah, what a mad bwd you Wostóvs ar!” h muttrd, and Rostóv
noticd tars in his ys.
CHAPTR XVI
In April th troops wr nlivnd by nws of th mpror’s arrival,
but Rostóv had no chanc of bing prsnt at th rviw h hld at
Bartnstin, as th Pávlograds wr at th outposts far byond that
plac.
Thy wr bivouacking. Dnísov and Rostóv wr living in an arth hut,
dug out for thm by th soldirs and roofd with branchs and turf. Th
hut was mad in th following mannr, which had thn com into vogu. A
trnch was dug thr and a half ft wid, four ft ight inchs dp,
and ight ft long. At on nd of th trnch, stps wr cut out and
ths formd th ntranc and vstibul. Th trnch itslf was th room,
in which th lucky ons, such as th squadron commandr, had a board,
lying on pils at th nd opposit th ntranc, to srv as a tabl. On
ach sid of th trnch, th arth was cut out to a bradth of about two
and a half ft, and this did duty for bdstads and couchs. Th roof
was so constructd that on could stand up in th middl of th trnch
and could vn sit up on th bds if on drw clos to th tabl.
Dnísov, who was living luxuriously bcaus th soldirs of his
squadron likd him, had also a board in th roof at th farthr nd,
with a pic of (brokn but mndd) glass in it for a window. Whn it
was vry cold, mbrs from th soldirs’ campfir wr placd on
a bnt sht of iron on th stps in th “rcption room”—as
Dnísov calld that part of th hut—and it was thn so warm that th
officrs, of whom thr wr always som with Dnísov and Rostóv, sat
in thir shirt slvs.
In April, Rostóv was on ordrly duty. On morning, btwn svn and
ight, rturning aftr a slplss night, h snt for mbrs, changd
his rain-soakd undrcloths, said his prayrs, drank ta, got warm,
thn tidid up th things on th tabl and in his own cornr, and,
his fac glowing from xposur to th wind and with nothing on but his
shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms undr his had. H was
plasantly considring th probability of bing promotd in a fw days
for his last rconnoitring xpdition, and was awaiting Dnísov, who
had gon out somwhr and with whom h wantd a talk.
Suddnly h hard Dnísov shouting in a vibrating voic bhind th hut,
vidntly much xcitd. Rostóv movd to th window to s whom h was
spaking to, and saw th quartrmastr, Topchnko.
“I ordrd you not to lt thm at that Máshka woot stuff!”
Dnísov was shouting. “And I saw with my own ys how Lazarchúk
bwought som fwom th filds.”
“I hav givn th ordr again and again, your honor, but thy don’t
oby,” answrd th quartrmastr.
Rostóv lay down again on his bd and thought complacntly: “Lt
him fuss and bustl now, my job’s don and I’m lying
down—capitally!” H could har that Lavrúshka—that sly, bold
ordrly of Dnísov’s—was talking, as wll as th quartrmastr.
Lavrúshka was saying somthing about loadd wagons, biscuits, and oxn
h had sn whn h had gon out for provisions.
Thn Dnísov’s voic was hard shouting farthr and farthr away.
“Saddl! Scond platoon!”
“Whr ar thy off to now?” thought Rostóv.
Fiv minuts latr, Dnísov cam into th hut, climbd with muddy boots
on th bd, lit his pip, furiously scattrd his things about, took
his ladd whip, buckld on his sabr, and wnt out again. In answr to
Rostóv’s inquiry whr h was going, h answrd vaguly and crossly
that h had som businss.
“Lt God and our gwat monarch judg m aftrwards!” said Dnísov
going out, and Rostóv hard th hoofs of svral horss splashing
through th mud. H did not vn troubl to find out whr Dnísov had
gon. Having got warm in his cornr, h fll aslp and did not lav
th hut till toward vning. Dnísov had not yt rturnd. Th wathr
had clard up, and nar th nxt hut two officrs and a cadt wr
playing sváyka, laughing as thy thrw thir missils which burid
thmslvs in th soft mud. Rostóv joind thm. In th middl of th
gam, th officrs saw som wagons approaching with fiftn hussars on
thir skinny horss bhind thm. Th wagons scortd by th hussars drw
up to th pickt rops and a crowd of hussars surroundd thm.
“Thr now, Dnísov has bn worrying,” said Rostóv, “and hr
ar th provisions.”
“So thy ar!” said th officrs. “Won’t th soldirs b
glad!”
A littl bhind th hussars cam Dnísov, accompanid by two infantry
officrs with whom h was talking.
Rostóv wnt to mt thm.
“I warn you, Captain,” on of th officrs, a short thin man,
vidntly vry angry, was saying.
“Havn’t I told you I won’t giv thm up?” rplid Dnísov.
“You will answr for it, Captain. It is mutiny—sizing th transport
of on’s own army. Our mn hav had nothing to at for two days.”
“And min hav had nothing for two wks,” said Dnísov.
“It is robbry! You’ll answr for it, sir!” said th infantry
officr, raising his voic.
“Now, what ar you pstwing m for?” crid Dnísov, suddnly
losing his tmpr. “I shall answr for it and not you, and you’d
bttr not buzz about hr till you gt hurt. B off! Go!” h shoutd
at th officrs.
“Vry wll, thn!” shoutd th littl officr, undauntd and not
riding away. “If you ar dtrmind to rob, I’ll...”
“Go to th dvil! quick ma’ch, whil you’r saf and sound!” and
Dnísov turnd his hors on th officr.
“Vry wll, vry wll!” muttrd th officr, thratningly, and
turning his hors h trottd away, jolting in his saddl.
“A dog astwid a fnc! A wal dog astwid a fnc!” shoutd
Dnísov aftr him (th most insulting xprssion a cavalryman can
addrss to a mountd infantryman) and riding up to Rostóv, h burst out
laughing.
“I’v takn twansports from th infantwy by forc!” h said.
“Aftr all, can’t lt our mn starv.”
Th wagons that had rachd th hussars had bn consignd to an
infantry rgimnt, but larning from Lavrúshka that th transport
was unscortd, Dnísov with his hussars had sizd it by forc. Th
soldirs had biscuits dalt out to thm frly, and thy vn shard
thm with th othr squadrons.
Th nxt day th rgimntal commandr snt for Dnísov, and holding his
fingrs sprad out bfor his ys said:
“This is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and
won’t bgin procdings, but I advis you to rid ovr to th staff
and sttl th businss thr in th commissariat dpartmnt and if
possibl sign a rcipt for such and such stors rcivd. If not, as
th dmand was bookd against an infantry rgimnt, thr will b a row
and th affair may nd badly.”
From th rgimntal commandr’s, Dnísov rod straight to th staff
with a sincr dsir to act on this advic. In th vning h cam
back to his dugout in a stat such as Rostóv had nvr yt sn him in.
Dnísov could not spak and gaspd for brath. Whn Rostóv askd what
was th mattr, h only uttrd som incohrnt oaths and thrats in a
hoars, fbl voic.
Alarmd at Dnísov’s condition, Rostóv suggstd that h should
undrss, drink som watr, and snd for th doctor.
“Twy m for wobbwy... oh! Som mor watr... Lt thm twy m, but
I’ll always thwash scoundwls... and I’ll tll th mpwo’...
Ic...” h muttrd.
Th rgimntal doctor, whn h cam, said it was absolutly ncssary
to bld Dnísov. A dp saucr of black blood was takn from his hairy
arm and only thn was h abl to rlat what had happnd to him.
“I gt thr,” bgan Dnísov. “‘Now thn, whr’s your
chif’s quartrs?’ Thy wr pointd out. ‘Plas to wait.’
‘I’v widdn twnty mils and hav dutis to attnd to and no tim
to wait. Announc m.’ Vwy wll, so out coms thir had
chif—also took it into his had to lctur m: ‘It’s
wobbwy!’—‘Wobbwy,’ I say, ‘is not don by man who sizs
pwovisions to fd his soldirs, but by him who taks thm to fill his
own pockts!’ ‘Will you plas b silnt?’ ‘Vwy good!’ Thn
h says: ‘Go and giv a wcipt to th commissionr, but your affair
will b passd on to hadquartrs.’ I go to th commissionr. I ntr,
and at th tabl... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it
that’s starving us?” shoutd Dnísov, hitting th tabl with th
fist of his nwly bld arm so violntly that th tabl narly brok down
and th tumblrs on it jumpd about. “Tlyánin! ‘What? So it’s
you who’s starving us to dath! Is it? Tak this and this!’ and I
hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... ‘Ah, what a... what a...!’
and I sta’td fwashing him... Wll, I’v had a bit of fun I can tll
you!” crid Dnísov, glful and yt angry, his whit tth showing
undr his black mustach. “I’d hav killd him if thy hadn’t
takn him away!”
“But what ar you shouting for? Calm yourslf,” said Rostóv.
“You’v st your arm blding afrsh. Wait, w must ti it up
again.”
Dnísov was bandagd up again and put to bd. Nxt day h wok calm and
chrful.
But at noon th adjutant of th rgimnt cam into Rostóv’s and
Dnísov’s dugout with a grav and srious fac and rgrtfully showd
thm a papr addrssd to Major Dnísov from th rgimntal commandr
in which inquiris wr mad about ystrday’s occurrnc. Th
adjutant told thm that th affair was likly to tak a vry bad
turn: that a court-martial had bn appointd, and that in viw of th
svrity with which marauding and insubordination wr now rgardd,
dgradation to th ranks would b th bst that could b hopd for.
Th cas, as rprsntd by th offndd partis, was that, aftr
sizing th transports, Major Dnísov, bing drunk, wnt to th chif
quartrmastr and without any provocation calld him a thif, thratnd
to strik him, and on bing ld out had rushd into th offic and givn
two officials a thrashing, and dislocatd th arm of on of thm.
In answr to Rostóv’s rnwd qustions, Dnísov said, laughing,
that h thought h rmmbrd that som othr fllow had got mixd up
in it, but that it was all nonsns and rubbish, and h did not in th
last far any kind of trial, and that if thos scoundrls dard attack
him h would giv thm an answr that thy would not asily forgt.
Dnísov spok contmptuously of th whol mattr, but Rostóv knw him
too wll not to dtct that (whil hiding it from othrs) at hart
h fard a court-martial and was worrid ovr th affair, which was
vidntly taking a bad turn. vry day, lttrs of inquiry and notics
from th court arrivd, and on th first of May, Dnísov was ordrd
to hand th squadron ovr to th nxt in sniority and appar bfor
th staff of his division to xplain his violnc at th commissariat
offic. On th prvious day Plátov rconnoitrd with two Cossack
rgimnts and two squadrons of hussars. Dnísov, as was his wont, rod
out in front of th outposts, parading his courag. A bullt fird by
a Frnch sharpshootr hit him in th flshy part of his lg. Prhaps at
anothr tim Dnísov would not hav lft th rgimnt for so slight a
wound, but now h took advantag of it to xcus himslf from apparing
at th staff and wnt into hospital.
CHAPTR XVII
In Jun th battl of Fridland was fought, in which th Pávlograds did
not tak part, and aftr that an armistic was proclaimd. Rostóv, who
flt his frind’s absnc vry much, having no nws of him sinc h
lft and fling vry anxious about his wound and th progrss of his
affairs, took advantag of th armistic to gt lav to visit Dnísov
in hospital.
Th hospital was in a small Prussian town that had bn twic dvastatd
by Russian and Frnch troops. Bcaus it was summr, whn it is so
bautiful out in th filds, th littl town prsntd a particularly
dismal apparanc with its brokn roofs and fncs, its foul strts,
tattrd inhabitants, and th sick and drunkn soldirs wandring about.
Th hospital was in a brick building with som of th window frams and
pans brokn and a courtyard surroundd by th rmains of a woodn fnc
that had bn pulld to pics. Svral bandagd soldirs, with pal
swolln facs, wr sitting or walking about in th sunshin in th
yard.
Dirctly Rostóv ntrd th door h was nvlopd by a smll of
putrfaction and hospital air. On th stairs h mt a Russian army
doctor smoking a cigar. Th doctor was followd by a Russian assistant.
“I can’t tar myslf to pics,” th doctor was saying. “Com to
Makár Alxvich in th vning. I shall b thr.”
Th assistant askd som furthr qustions.
“Oh, do th bst you can! Isn’t it all th sam?” Th doctor
noticd Rostóv coming upstairs.
“What do you want, sir?” said th doctor. “What do you want?
Th bullts having spard you, do you want to try typhus? This is a
psthous, sir.”
“How so?” askd Rostóv.
“Typhus, sir. It’s dath to go in. Only w two, Makv and I” (h
pointd to th assistant), “kp on hr. Som fiv of us doctors hav
did in this plac.... Whn a nw on coms h is don for in a wk,”
said th doctor with vidnt satisfaction. “Prussian doctors hav bn
invitd hr, but our allis don’t lik it at all.”
Rostóv xplaind that h wantd to s Major Dnísov of th hussars,
who was woundd.
“I don’t know. I can’t tll you, sir. Only think! I am alon in
charg of thr hospitals with mor than four hundrd patints! It’s
wll that th charitabl Prussian ladis snd us two pounds of coff
and som lint ach month or w should b lost!” h laughd. “Four
hundrd, sir, and thy’r always snding m frsh ons. Thr ar four
hundrd? h?” h askd, turning to th assistant.
Th assistant lookd faggd out. H was vidntly vxd and impatint
for th talkativ doctor to go.
“Major Dnísov,” Rostóv said again. “H was woundd at
Mollitn.”
“Dad, I fancy. h, Makv?” qurid th doctor, in a ton of
indiffrnc.
Th assistant, howvr, did not confirm th doctor’s words.
“Is h tall and with rddish hair?” askd th doctor.
Rostóv dscribd Dnísov’s apparanc.
“Thr was on lik that,” said th doctor, as if plasd. “That
on is dad, I fancy. Howvr, I’ll look up our list. W had a list.
Hav you got it, Makv?”
“Makár Alxvich has th list,” answrd th assistant. “But if
you’ll stp into th officrs’ wards you’ll s for yourslf,”
h addd, turning to Rostóv.
“Ah, you’d bttr not go, sir,” said th doctor, “or you may
hav to stay hr yourslf.”
But Rostóv bowd himslf away from th doctor and askd th assistant
to show him th way.
“Only don’t blam m!” th doctor shoutd up aftr him.
Rostóv and th assistant wnt into th dark corridor. Th smll was so
strong thr that Rostóv hld his nos and had to paus and collct
his strngth bfor h could go on. A door opnd to th right, and an
maciatd sallow man on crutchs, barfoot and in undrclothing, limpd
out and, laning against th doorpost, lookd with glittring nvious
ys at thos who wr passing. Glancing in at th door, Rostóv
saw that th sick and woundd wr lying on th floor on straw and
ovrcoats.
“May I go in and look?”
“What is thr to s?” said th assistant.
But, just bcaus th assistant vidntly did not want him to go in,
Rostóv ntrd th soldirs’ ward. Th foul air, to which h had
alrady bgun to gt usd in th corridor, was still strongr hr. It
was a littl diffrnt, mor pungnt, and on flt that this was whr
it originatd.
In th long room, brightly lit up by th sun through th larg windows,
th sick and woundd lay in two rows with thir hads to th walls, and
laving a passag in th middl. Most of thm wr unconscious and
paid no attntion to th nwcomrs. Thos who wr conscious raisd
thmslvs or liftd thir thin yllow facs, and all lookd intntly at
Rostóv with th sam xprssion of hop, of rlif, rproach, and
nvy of anothr’s halth. Rostóv wnt to th middl of th room and
looking through th opn doors into th two adjoining rooms saw th sam
thing thr. H stood still, looking silntly around. H had not at all
xpctd such a sight. Just bfor him, almost across th middl of th
passag on th bar floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judg
by th cut of his hair. Th man lay on his back, his hug arms and lgs
outstrtchd. His fac was purpl, his ys wr rolld back so that
only th whits wr sn, and on his bar lgs and arms which wr
still rd, th vins stood out lik cords. H was knocking th back of
his had against th floor, hoarsly uttring som word which h kpt
rpating. Rostóv listnd and mad out th word. It was “drink,
drink, a drink!” Rostóv glancd round, looking for somon who would
put this man back in his plac and bring him watr.
“Who looks aftr th sick hr?” h askd th assistant.
Just thn a commissariat soldir, a hospital ordrly, cam in from th
nxt room, marching stiffly, and drw up in front of Rostóv.
“Good day, your honor!” h shoutd, rolling his ys at Rostóv and
vidntly mistaking him for on of th hospital authoritis.
“Gt him to his plac and giv him som watr,” said Rostóv,
pointing to th Cossack.
“Ys, your honor,” th soldir rplid complacntly, and rolling
his ys mor than vr h drw himslf up still straightr, but did not
mov.
“No, it’s impossibl to do anything hr,” thought Rostóv,
lowring his ys, and h was going out, but bcam awar of an intns
look fixd on him on his right, and h turnd. Clos to th cornr, on
an ovrcoat, sat an old, unshavn, gray-bardd soldir as thin as a
sklton, with a strn sallow fac and ys intntly fixd on Rostóv.
Th man’s nighbor on on sid whisprd somthing to him, pointing
at Rostóv, who noticd that th old man wantd to spak to him. H drw
narr and saw that th old man had only on lg bnt undr him, th
othr had bn amputatd abov th kn. His nighbor on th othr sid,
who lay motionlss som distanc from him with his had thrown back, was
a young soldir with a snub nos. His pal waxn fac was still frckld
and his ys wr rolld back. Rostóv lookd at th young soldir and a
cold chill ran down his back.
“Why, this on sms...” h bgan, turning to th assistant.
“And how w’v bn bgging, your honor,” said th old soldir,
his jaw quivring. “H’s bn dad sinc morning. Aftr all w’r
mn, not dogs.”
“I’ll snd somon at onc. H shall b takn away—takn away at
onc,” said th assistant hurridly. “Lt us go, your honor.”
“Ys, ys, lt us go,” said Rostóv hastily, and lowring his
ys and shrinking, h trid to pass unnoticd btwn th rows of
rproachful nvious ys that wr fixd upon him, and wnt out of th
room.
CHAPTR XVIII
Going along th corridor, th assistant ld Rostóv to th officrs’
wards, consisting of thr rooms, th doors of which stood opn. Thr
wr bds in ths rooms and th sick and woundd officrs wr lying or
sitting on thm. Som wr walking about th rooms in hospital drssing
gowns. Th first prson Rostóv mt in th officrs’ ward was a thin
littl man with on arm, who was walking about th first room in a
nightcap and hospital drssing gown, with a pip btwn his tth.
Rostóv lookd at him, trying to rmmbr whr h had sn him bfor.
“S whr w’v mt again!” said th littl man. “Túshin,
Túshin, don’t you rmmbr, who gav you a lift at Schön Grabrn?
And I’v had a bit cut off, you s...” h wnt on with a smil,
pointing to th mpty slv of his drssing gown. “Looking for
Vasíli Dmítrich Dnísov? My nighbor,” h addd, whn h hard
who Rostóv wantd. “Hr, hr,” and Túshin ld him into th nxt
room, from whnc cam sounds of svral laughing voics.
“How can thy laugh, or vn liv at all hr?” thought Rostóv,
still awar of that smll of dcomposing flsh that had bn so strong
in th soldirs’ ward, and still sming to s fixd on him thos
nvious looks which had followd him out from both sids, and th fac
of that young soldir with ys rolld back.
Dnísov lay aslp on his bd with his had undr th blankt, though
it was narly noon.
“Ah, Wostóv? How ar you, how ar you?” h calld out, still in th
sam voic as in th rgimnt, but Rostóv noticd sadly that undr this
habitual as and animation som nw, sinistr, hiddn fling showd
itslf in th xprssion of Dnísov’s fac and th intonations of his
voic.
His wound, though a slight on, had not yt hald vn now, six wks
aftr h had bn hit. His fac had th sam swolln pallor as th facs
of th othr hospital patints, but it was not this that struck Rostóv.
What struck him was that Dnísov did not sm glad to s him, and
smild at him unnaturally. H did not ask about th rgimnt, nor about
th gnral stat of affairs, and whn Rostóv spok of ths mattrs
did not listn.
Rostóv vn noticd that Dnísov did not lik to b rmindd of th
rgimnt, or in gnral of that othr fr lif which was going on
outsid th hospital. H smd to try to forgt that old lif and
was only intrstd in th affair with th commissariat officrs. On
Rostóv’s inquiry as to how th mattr stood, h at onc producd from
undr his pillow a papr h had rcivd from th commission and th
rough draft of his answr to it. H bcam animatd whn h bgan
rading his papr and spcially drw Rostóv’s attntion to th
stinging rjoindrs h mad to his nmis. His hospital companions,
who had gathrd round Rostóv—a frsh arrival from th world
outsid—gradually bgan to disprs as soon as Dnísov bgan rading
his answr. Rostóv noticd by thir facs that all thos gntlmn had
alrady hard that story mor than onc and wr tird of it. Only th
man who had th nxt bd, a stout Uhlan, continud to sit on his bd,
gloomily frowning and smoking a pip, and littl on-armd Túshin still
listnd, shaking his had disapprovingly. In th middl of th rading,
th Uhlan intrruptd Dnísov.
“But what I say is,” h said, turning to Rostóv, “it would b
bst simply to ptition th mpror for pardon. Thy say grat rwards
will now b distributd, and surly a pardon would b grantd....”
“M ptition th mpwo’!” xclaimd Dnísov, in a voic to which
h trid hard to giv th old nrgy and fir, but which soundd lik
an xprssion of irritabl impotnc. “What for? If I wr a wobbr I
would ask mrcy, but I’m bing court-martiald for bwinging wobbrs
to book. Lt thm twy m, I’m not afwaid of anyon. I’v srvd
th Tsar and my countwy honowably and hav not stoln! And am I to b
dgwadd?... Listn, I’m w’iting to thm stwaight. This is what I
say: ‘If I had wobbd th Twasuwy...’”
“It’s crtainly wll writtn,” said Túshin, “but that’s not
th point, Vasíli Dmítrich,” and h also turnd to Rostóv. “On
has to submit, and Vasíli Dmítrich dosn’t want to. You know th
auditor told you it was a bad businss.”
“Wll, lt it b bad,” said Dnísov.
“Th auditor wrot out a ptition for you,” continud Túshin,
“and you ought to sign it and ask this gntlman to tak it. No doubt
h” (indicating Rostóv) “has connctions on th staff. You won’t
find a bttr opportunity.”
“Havn’t I said I’m not going to gwovl?” Dnísov intrruptd
him, wnt on rading his papr.
Rostóv had not th courag to prsuad Dnísov, though h
instinctivly flt that th way advisd by Túshin and th othr
officrs was th safst, and though h would hav bn glad to b of
srvic to Dnísov. H knw his stubborn will and straightforward hasty
tmpr.
Whn th rading of Dnísov’s virulnt rply, which took mor than an
hour, was ovr, Rostóv said nothing, and h spnt th rst of th day
in a most djctd stat of mind amid Dnísov’s hospital comrads,
who had gathrd round him, tlling thm what h knw and listning to
thir storis. Dnísov was moodily silnt all th vning.
Lat in th vning, whn Rostóv was about to lav, h askd Dnísov
whthr h had no commission for him.
“Ys, wait a bit,” said Dnísov, glancing round at th officrs,
and taking his paprs from undr his pillow h wnt to th window, whr
h had an inkpot, and sat down to writ.
“It sms it’s no us knocking on’s had against a wall!” h
said, coming from th window and giving Rostóv a larg nvlop. In
it was th ptition to th mpror drawn up by th auditor, in
which Dnísov, without alluding to th offnss of th commissariat
officials, simply askd for pardon.
“Hand it in. It sms...”
H did not finish, but gav a painfully unnatural smil.
CHAPTR XIX
Having rturnd to th rgimnt and told th commandr th stat of
Dnísov’s affairs, Rostóv rod to Tilsit with th lttr to th
mpror.
On th thirtnth of Jun th Frnch and Russian mprors arrivd in
Tilsit. Borís Drubtskóy had askd th important prsonag on whom h
was in attndanc, to includ him in th suit appointd for th stay at
Tilsit.
“I should lik to s th grat man,” h said, alluding to Napolon,
whom hithrto h, lik vryon ls, had always calld Buonapart.
“You ar spaking of Buonapart?” askd th gnral, smiling.
Borís lookd at his gnral inquiringly and immdiatly saw that h was
bing tstd.
“I am spaking, Princ, of th mpror Napolon,” h rplid. Th
gnral pattd him on th shouldr, with a smil.
“You will go far,” h said, and took him to Tilsit with him.
Borís was among th fw prsnt at th Nimn on th day th two
mprors mt. H saw th raft, dcoratd with monograms, saw Napolon
pass bfor th Frnch Guards on th farthr bank of th rivr, saw th
pnsiv fac of th mpror Alxandr as h sat in silnc in a tavrn
on th bank of th Nimn awaiting Napolon’s arrival, saw both
mprors gt into boats, and saw how Napolon—raching th raft
first—stppd quickly forward to mt Alxandr and hld out his hand
to him, and how thy both rtird into th pavilion. Sinc h had bgun
to mov in th highst circls Borís had mad it his habit to watch
attntivly all that wnt on around him and to not it down. At th tim
of th mting at Tilsit h askd th nams of thos who had com with
Napolon and about th uniforms thy wor, and listnd attntivly to
words spokn by important prsonags. At th momnt th mprors wnt
into th pavilion h lookd at his watch, and did not forgt to look at
it again whn Alxandr cam out. Th intrviw had lastd an hour and
fifty-thr minuts. H notd this down that sam vning, among othr
facts h flt to b of historic importanc. As th mpror’s suit
was a vry small on, it was a mattr of grat importanc, for a man who
valud his succss in th srvic, to b at Tilsit on th occasion of
this intrviw btwn th two mprors, and having succdd in this,
Borís flt that hncforth his position was fully assurd. H had not
only bcom known, but popl had grown accustomd to him and accptd
him. Twic h had xcutd commissions to th mpror himslf, so
that th lattr knw his fac, and all thos at court, far from
cold-shouldring him as at first whn thy considrd him a nwcomr,
would now hav bn surprisd had h bn absnt.
Borís lodgd with anothr adjutant, th Polish Count Zhilínski.
Zhilínski, a Pol brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionatly
fond of th Frnch, and almost vry day of th stay at Tilsit, Frnch
officrs of th Guard and from Frnch hadquartrs wr dining and
lunching with him and Borís.
On th vning of th twnty-fourth of Jun, Count Zhilínski arrangd a
suppr for his Frnch frinds. Th gust of honor was an aid-d-camp of
Napolon’s, thr wr also svral Frnch officrs of th Guard,
and a pag of Napolon’s, a young lad of an old aristocratic Frnch
family. That sam day, Rostóv, profiting by th darknss to avoid bing
rcognizd in civilian drss, cam to Tilsit and wnt to th lodging
occupid by Borís and Zhilínski.
Rostóv, in common with th whol army from which h cam, was far
from having xprincd th chang of fling toward Napolon and th
Frnch—who from bing fos had suddnly bcom frinds—that had
takn plac at hadquartrs and in Borís. In th army, Bonapart and
th Frnch wr still rgardd with mingld flings of angr, contmpt,
and far. Only rcntly, talking with on of Plátov’s Cossack
officrs, Rostóv had argud that if Napolon wr takn prisonr h
would b tratd not as a sovrign, but as a criminal. Quit latly,
happning to mt a woundd Frnch colonl on th road, Rostóv had
maintaind with hat that pac was impossibl btwn a lgitimat
sovrign and th criminal Bonapart. Rostóv was thrfor unplasantly
struck by th prsnc of Frnch officrs in Borís’ lodging, drssd
in uniforms h had bn accustomd to s from quit a diffrnt point
of viw from th outposts of th flank. As soon as h noticd a Frnch
officr, who thrust his had out of th door, that warlik fling of
hostility which h always xprincd at th sight of th nmy suddnly
sizd him. H stoppd at th thrshold and askd in Russian whthr
Drubtskóy livd thr. Borís, haring a strang voic in th
antroom, cam out to mt him. An xprssion of annoyanc showd itslf
for a momnt on his fac on first rcognizing Rostóv.
“Ah, it’s you? Vry glad, vry glad to s you,” h said, howvr,
coming toward him with a smil. But Rostóv had noticd his first
impuls.
“I’v com at a bad tim I think. I should not hav com, but I hav
businss,” h said coldly.
“No, I only wondr how you managd to gt away from your rgimnt.
Dans un momnt j suis à vous,” * h said, answring somon who
calld him.
    * “In a minut I shall b at your disposal.”
“I s I’m intruding,” Rostóv rpatd.
Th look of annoyanc had alrady disappard from Borís’ fac:
having vidntly rflctd and dcidd how to act, h vry quitly took
both Rostóv’s hands and ld him into th nxt room. His ys, looking
srnly and stadily at Rostóv, smd to b vild by somthing,
as if scrnd by blu spctacls of convntionality. So it smd to
Rostóv.
“Oh, com now! As if you could com at a wrong tim!” said Borís,
and h ld him into th room whr th suppr tabl was laid and
introducd him to his gusts, xplaining that h was not a civilian, but
an hussar officr, and an old frind of his.
“Count Zhilínski—l Comt N. N.—l Capitain S. S.,” said h,
naming his gusts. Rostóv lookd frowningly at th Frnchmn, bowd
rluctantly, and rmaind silnt.
Zhilínski vidntly did not rciv this nw Russian prson vry
willingly into his circl and did not spak to Rostóv. Borís did not
appar to notic th constraint th nwcomr producd and, with th sam
plasant composur and th sam vild look in his ys with which
h had mt Rostóv, trid to nlivn th convrsation. On of th
Frnchmn, with th politnss charactristic of his countrymn,
addrssd th obstinatly taciturn Rostóv, saying that th lattr had
probably com to Tilsit to s th mpror.
“No, I cam on businss,” rplid Rostóv, brifly.
Rostóv had bn out of humor from th momnt h noticd th look of
dissatisfaction on Borís’ fac, and as always happns to thos in a
bad humor, it smd to him that vryon rgardd him with avrsion
and that h was in vrybody’s way. H rally was in thir way, for h
alon took no part in th convrsation which again bcam gnral. Th
looks th visitors cast on him smd to say: “And what is h sitting
hr for?” H ros and wnt up to Borís.
“Anyhow, I’m in your way,” h said in a low ton. “Com and talk
ovr my businss and I’ll go away.”
“Oh, no, not at all,” said Borís. “But if you ar tird, com and
li down in my room and hav a rst.”
“Ys, rally...”
Thy wnt into th littl room whr Borís slpt. Rostóv, without
sitting down, bgan at onc, irritably (as if Borís wr to blam in
som way) tlling him about Dnísov’s affair, asking him whthr,
through his gnral, h could and would intrcd with th mpror on
Dnísov’s bhalf and gt Dnísov’s ptition handd in. Whn h
and Borís wr alon, Rostóv flt for th first tim that h could not
look Borís in th fac without a sns of awkwardnss. Borís, with on
lg crossd ovr th othr and stroking his lft hand with th slndr
fingrs of his right, listnd to Rostóv as a gnral listns to th
rport of a subordinat, now looking asid and now gazing straight into
Rostóv’s ys with th sam vild look. ach tim this happnd
Rostóv flt uncomfortabl and cast down his ys.
“I hav hard of such cass and know that His Majsty is vry svr
in such affairs. I think it would b bst not to bring it bfor th
mpror, but to apply to th commandr of th corps.... But in gnral,
I think...”
“So you don’t want to do anything? Wll thn, say so!” Rostóv
almost shoutd, not looking Borís in th fac.
Borís smild.
“On th contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...”
At that momnt Zhilínski’s voic was hard calling Borís.
“Wll thn, go, go, go...” said Rostóv, and rfusing suppr and
rmaining alon in th littl room, h walkd up and down for a long
tim, haring th lighthartd Frnch convrsation from th nxt room.
CHAPTR XX
Rostóv had com to Tilsit th day last suitabl for a ptition
on Dnísov’s bhalf. H could not himslf go to th gnral in
attndanc as h was in mufti and had com to Tilsit without prmission
to do so, and Borís, vn had h wishd to, could not hav don so on
th following day. On that day, Jun 27, th prliminaris of pac wr
signd. Th mprors xchangd dcorations: Alxandr rcivd th Cross
of th Lgion of Honor and Napolon th Ordr of St. Andrw of th
First Dgr, and a dinnr had bn arrangd for th vning, givn by
a battalion of th Frnch Guards to th Probrazhnsk battalion. Th
mprors wr to b prsnt at that banqut.
Rostóv flt so ill at as and uncomfortabl with Borís that, whn th
lattr lookd in aftr suppr, h prtndd to b aslp, and arly nxt
morning wnt away, avoiding Borís. In his civilian cloths and a
round hat, h wandrd about th town, staring at th Frnch and thir
uniforms and at th strts and houss whr th Russian and Frnch
mprors wr staying. In a squar h saw tabls bing st up and
prparations mad for th dinnr; h saw th Russian and Frnch colors
drapd from sid to sid of th strts, with hug monograms A and N. In
th windows of th houss also flags and bunting wr displayd.
“Borís dosn’t want to hlp m and I don’t want to ask him.
That’s sttld,” thought Nicholas. “All is ovr btwn us, but
I won’t lav hr without having don all I can for Dnísov and
crtainly not without gtting his lttr to th mpror. Th mpror!...
H is hr!” thought Rostóv, who had unconsciously rturnd to th
hous whr Alxandr lodgd.
Saddld horss wr standing bfor th hous and th suit wr
assmbling, vidntly prparing for th mpror to com out.
“I may s him at any momnt,” thought Rostóv. “If only I wr
to hand th lttr dirct to him and tll him all... could thy rally
arrst m for my civilian cloths? Surly not! H would undrstand on
whos sid justic lis. H undrstands vrything, knows vrything.
Who can b mor just, mor magnanimous than h? And vn if thy did
arrst m for bing hr, what would it mattr?” thought h, looking
at an officr who was ntring th hous th mpror occupid. “Aftr
all, popl do go in.... It’s all nonsns! I’ll go in and hand
th lttr to th mpror myslf so much th wors for Drubtskóy who
drivs m to it!” And suddnly with a dtrmination h himslf did not
xpct, Rostóv flt for th lttr in his pockt and wnt straight to
th hous.
“No, I won’t miss my opportunity now, as I did aftr Austrlitz,”
h thought, xpcting vry momnt to mt th monarch, and conscious of
th blood that rushd to his hart at th thought. “I will fall at
his ft and bsch him. H will lift m up, will listn, and will vn
thank m. ‘I am happy whn I can do good, but to rmdy injustic is
th gratst happinss,’” Rostóv fancid th sovrign saying. And
passing popl who lookd aftr him with curiosity, h ntrd th porch
of th mpror’s hous.
A broad staircas ld straight up from th ntry, and to th right h
saw a closd door. Blow, undr th staircas, was a door lading to th
lowr floor.
“Whom do you want?” somon inquird.
“To hand in a lttr, a ptition, to His Majsty,” said Nicholas,
with a trmor in his voic.
“A ptition? This way, to th officr on duty” (h was shown th
door lading downstairs), “only it won’t b accptd.”
On haring this indiffrnt voic, Rostóv grw frightnd at what
h was doing; th thought of mting th mpror at any momnt was so
fascinating and consquntly so alarming that h was rady to run away,
but th official who had qustiond him opnd th door, and Rostóv
ntrd.
A short stout man of about thirty, in whit brchs and high boots and
a batist shirt that h had vidntly only just put on, standing in that
room, and his valt was buttoning on to th back of his brchs a
nw pair of handsom silk-mbroidrd bracs that, for som rason,
attractd Rostóv’s attntion. This man was spaking to somon in th
adjoining room.
“A good figur and in hr first bloom,” h was saying, but on sing
Rostóv, h stoppd short and frownd.
“What is it? A ptition?”
“What is it?” askd th prson in th othr room.
“Anothr ptitionr,” answrd th man with th bracs.
“Tll him to com latr. H’ll b coming out dirctly, w must
go.”
“Latr... latr! Tomorrow. It’s too lat...”
Rostóv turnd and was about to go, but th man in th bracs stoppd
him.
“Whom hav you com from? Who ar you?”
“I com from Major Dnísov,” answrd Rostóv.
“Ar you an officr?”
“Liutnant Count Rostóv.”
“What audacity! Hand it in through your commandr. And go along with
you... go,” and h continud to put on th uniform th valt handd
him.
Rostóv wnt back into th hall and noticd that in th porch thr wr
many officrs and gnrals in full parad uniform, whom h had to pass.
Cursing his tmrity, his hart sinking at th thought of finding
himslf at any momnt fac to fac with th mpror and bing put to
sham and arrstd in his prsnc, fully aliv now to th improprity
of his conduct and rpnting of it, Rostóv, with downcast ys, was
making his way out of th hous through th brilliant suit whn a
familiar voic calld him and a hand dtaind him.
“What ar you doing hr, sir, in civilian drss?” askd a dp
voic.
It was a cavalry gnral who had obtaind th mpror’s spcial favor
during this campaign, and who had formrly commandd th division in
which Rostóv was srving.
Rostóv, in dismay, bgan justifying himslf, but sing th kindly,
jocular fac of th gnral, h took him asid and in an xcitd voic
told him th whol affair, asking him to intrcd for Dnísov, whom
th gnral knw. Having hard Rostóv to th nd, th gnral shook his
had gravly.
“I’m sorry, sorry for that fin fllow. Giv m th lttr.”
Hardly had Rostóv handd him th lttr and finishd xplaining
Dnísov’s cas, whn hasty stps and th jingling of spurs wr hard
on th stairs, and th gnral, laving him, wnt to th porch. Th
gntlmn of th mpror’s suit ran down th stairs and wnt to thir
horss. Hayn, th sam groom who had bn at Austrlitz, ld up th
mpror’s hors, and th faint crak of a footstp Rostóv knw at
onc was hard on th stairs. Forgtting th dangr of bing rcognizd,
Rostóv wnt clos to th porch, togthr with som inquisitiv
civilians, and again, aftr two yars, saw thos faturs h adord:
that sam fac and sam look and stp, and th sam union of majsty and
mildnss.... And th fling of nthusiasm and lov for his sovrign
ros again in Rostóv’s soul in all its old forc. In th uniform of
th Probrazhnsk rgimnt—whit chamois-lathr brchs and high
boots—and waring a star Rostóv did not know (it was that of th
Lgion d’honnur), th monarch cam out into th porch, putting on
his glovs and carrying his hat undr his arm. H stoppd and lookd
about him, brightning vrything around by his glanc. H spok a fw
words to som of th gnrals, and, rcognizing th formr commandr of
Rostóv’s division, smild and bckond to him.
All th suit drw back and Rostóv saw th gnral talking for som
tim to th mpror.
Th mpror said a fw words to him and took a stp toward his hors.
Again th crowd of mmbrs of th suit and strt gazrs (among whom
was Rostóv) movd narr to th mpror. Stopping bsid his hors,
with his hand on th saddl, th mpror turnd to th cavalry gnral
and said in a loud voic, vidntly wishing to b hard by all:
“I cannot do it, Gnral. I cannot, bcaus th law is strongr than
I,” and h raisd his foot to th stirrup.
Th gnral bowd his had rspctfully, and th monarch mountd and
rod down th strt at a gallop. Bsid himslf with nthusiasm,
Rostóv ran aftr him with th crowd.
CHAPTR XXI
Th mpror rod to th squar whr, facing on anothr, a battalion
of th Probrazhnsk rgimnt stood on th right and a battalion of th
Frnch Guards in thir barskin caps on th lft.
As th Tsar rod up to on flank of th battalions, which prsntd
arms, anothr group of horsmn gallopd up to th opposit flank, and
at th had of thm Rostóv rcognizd Napolon. It could b no on
ls. H cam at a gallop, waring a small hat, a blu uniform opn ovr
a whit vst, and th St. Andrw ribbon ovr his shouldr. H was riding
a vry fin thoroughbrd gray Arab hors with a crimson gold-mbroidrd
saddlcloth. On approaching Alxandr h raisd his hat, and as h did
so, Rostóv, with his cavalryman’s y, could not hlp noticing
that Napolon did not sit wll or firmly in th saddl. Th battalions
shoutd “Hurrah!” and “Viv l’mprur!” Napolon said
somthing to Alxandr, and both mprors dismountd and took ach
othr’s hands. Napolon’s fac wor an unplasant and artificial
smil. Alxandr was saying somthing affabl to him.
In spit of th trampling of th Frnch gndarms’ horss, which
wr pushing back th crowd, Rostóv kpt his ys on vry movmnt
of Alxandr and Bonapart. It struck him as a surpris that Alxandr
tratd Bonapart as an qual and that th lattr was quit at as with
th Tsar, as if such rlations with an mpror wr an vryday mattr
to him.
Alxandr and Napolon, with th long train of thir suits, approachd
th right flank of th Probrazhnsk battalion and cam straight up to
th crowd standing thr. Th crowd unxpctdly found itslf so clos
to th mprors that Rostóv, standing in th front row, was afraid h
might b rcognizd.
“Sir, I ask your prmission to prsnt th Lgion of Honor to th
bravst of your soldirs,” said a sharp, prcis voic, articulating
vry lttr.
This was said by th undrsizd Napolon, looking up straight into
Alxandr’s ys. Alxandr listnd attntivly to what was said to
him and, bnding his had, smild plasantly.
“To him who has born himslf most bravly in this last war,” addd
Napolon, accntuating ach syllabl, as with a composur and assuranc
xasprating to Rostóv, h ran his ys ovr th Russian ranks drawn
up bfor him, who all prsntd arms with thir ys fixd on thir
mpror.
“Will Your Majsty allow m to consult th colonl?” said Alxandr
and took a fw hasty stps toward Princ Kozlóvski, th commandr of
th battalion.
Bonapart manwhil bgan taking th glov off his small whit hand,
tor it in doing so, and thrw it away. An aid-d-camp bhind him
rushd forward and pickd it up.
“To whom shall it b givn?” th mpror Alxandr askd Kozlóvski,
in Russian in a low voic.
“To whomvr Your Majsty commands.”
Th mpror knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back,
rmarkd:
“But w must giv him an answr.”
Kozlóvski scannd th ranks rsolutly and includd Rostóv in his
scrutiny.
“Can it b m?” thought Rostóv.
“Lázarv!” th colonl calld, with a frown, and Lázarv, th
first soldir in th rank, stppd briskly forward.
“Whr ar you off to? Stop hr!” voics whisprd to Lázarv who
did not know whr to go. Lázarv stoppd, casting a sidlong look at
his colonl in alarm. His fac twitchd, as oftn happns to soldirs
calld bfor th ranks.
Napolon slightly turnd his had, and put his plump littl hand out
bhind him as if to tak somthing. Th mmbrs of his suit, gussing
at onc what h wantd, movd about and whisprd as thy passd
somthing from on to anothr, and a pag—th sam on Rostóv
had sn th prvious vning at Borís’—ran forward and, bowing
rspctfully ovr th outstrtchd hand and not kping it waiting a
momnt, laid in it an Ordr on a rd ribbon. Napolon, without looking,
prssd two fingrs togthr and th badg was btwn thm. Thn h
approachd Lázarv (who rolld his ys and prsistntly gazd at his
own monarch), lookd round at th mpror Alxandr to imply that what
h was now doing was don for th sak of his ally, and th small whit
hand holding th Ordr touchd on of Lázarv’s buttons. It was as if
Napolon knw that it was only ncssary for his hand to dign to touch
that soldir’s brast for th soldir to b forvr happy, rwardd,
and distinguishd from vryon ls in th world. Napolon mrly laid
th cross on Lázarv’s brast and, dropping his hand, turnd toward
Alxandr as though sur that th cross would adhr thr. And it
rally did.
Officious hands, Russian and Frnch, immdiatly sizd th cross and
fastnd it to th uniform. Lázarv glancd morosly at th littl
man with whit hands who was doing somthing to him and, still standing
motionlss prsnting arms, lookd again straight into Alxandr’s
ys, as if asking whthr h should stand thr, or go away, or do
somthing ls. But rciving no ordrs, h rmaind for som tim in
that rigid position.
Th mprors rmountd and rod away. Th Probrazhnsk battalion,
braking rank, mingld with th Frnch Guards and sat down at th tabls
prpard for thm.
Lázarv sat in th plac of honor. Russian and Frnch officrs mbracd
him, congratulatd him, and prssd his hands. Crowds of officrs and
civilians drw nar mrly to s him. A rumbl of Russian and Frnch
voics and laughtr filld th air round th tabls in th squar.
Two officrs with flushd facs, looking chrful and happy, passd by
Rostóv.
“What d’you think of th trat? All on silvr plat,” on of thm
was saying. “Hav you sn Lázarv?”
“I hav.”
“Tomorrow, I har, th Probrazhnskis will giv thm a dinnr.”
“Ys, but what luck for Lázarv! Twlv hundrd francs’ pnsion for
lif.”
“Hr’s a cap, lads!” shoutd a Probrazhnsk soldir, donning a
shaggy Frnch cap.
“It’s a fin thing! First-rat!”
“Hav you hard th password?” askd on Guards’ officr of
anothr. “Th day bfor ystrday it was ‘Napolon, Franc,
bravour’; ystrday, ‘Alxandr, Russi, grandur.’ On day our
mpror givs it and nxt day Napolon. Tomorrow our mpror will snd
a St. Gorg’s Cross to th bravst of th Frnch Guards. It has to b
don. H must rspond in kind.”
Borís, too, with his frind Zhilínski, cam to s th Probrazhnsk
banqut. On his way back, h noticd Rostóv standing by th cornr of a
hous.
“Rostóv! How d’you do? W missd on anothr,” h said, and could
not rfrain from asking what was th mattr, so strangly dismal and
troubld was Rostóv’s fac.
“Nothing, nothing,” rplid Rostóv.
“You’ll call round?”
“Ys, I will.”
Rostóv stood at that cornr for a long tim, watching th fast from a
distanc. In his mind, a painful procss was going on which h could
not bring to a conclusion. Trribl doubts ros in his soul. Now h
rmmbrd Dnísov with his changd xprssion, his submission, and th
whol hospital, with arms and lgs torn off and its dirt and disas. So
vividly did h rcall that hospital stnch of dad flsh that h
lookd round to s whr th smll cam from. Nxt h thought of that
slf-satisfid Bonapart, with his small whit hand, who was now an
mpror, likd and rspctd by Alxandr. Thn why thos svrd
arms and lgs and thos dad mn?... Thn again h thought of Lázarv
rwardd and Dnísov punishd and unpardond. H caught himslf
harboring such strang thoughts that h was frightnd.
Th smll of th food th Probrazhnskis wr ating and a sns of
hungr rcalld him from ths rflctions; h had to gt somthing to
at bfor going away. H wnt to a hotl h had noticd that morning.
Thr h found so many popl, among thm officrs who, lik himslf,
had com in civilian cloths, that h had difficulty in gtting a
dinnr. Two officrs of his own division joind him. Th convrsation
naturally turnd on th pac. Th officrs, his comrads, lik most of
th army, wr dissatisfid with th pac concludd aftr th battl of
Fridland. Thy said that had w hld out a littl longr Napolon would
hav bn don for, as his troops had nithr provisions nor ammunition.
Nicholas at and drank (chifly th lattr) in silnc. H finishd a
coupl of bottls of win by himslf. Th procss in his mind wnt on
tormnting him without raching a conclusion. H fard to giv way to
his thoughts, yt could not gt rid of thm. Suddnly, on on of th
officrs’ saying that it was humiliating to look at th Frnch,
Rostóv bgan shouting with uncalld-for wrath, and thrfor much to
th surpris of th officrs:
“How can you judg what’s bst?” h crid, th blood suddnly
rushing to his fac. “How can you judg th mpror’s actions? What
right hav w to argu? W cannot comprhnd ithr th mpror’s aims
or his actions!”
“But I nvr said a word about th mpror!” said th officr,
justifying himslf, and unabl to undrstand Rostóv’s outburst,
xcpt on th supposition that h was drunk.
But Rostóv did not listn to him.
“W ar not diplomatic officials, w ar soldirs and nothing mor,”
h wnt on. “If w ar ordrd to di, w must di. If w’r
punishd, it mans that w hav dsrvd it, it’s not for us to judg.
If th mpror plass to rcogniz Bonapart as mpror and to conclud
an allianc with him, it mans that that is th right thing to do. If
onc w bgin judging and arguing about vrything, nothing sacrd
will b lft! That way w shall b saying thr is no God—nothing!”
shoutd Nicholas, banging th tabl—vry littl to th point as it
smd to his listnrs, but quit rlvantly to th cours of his own
thoughts.
“Our businss is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That’s
all....” said h.
“And to drink,” said on of th officrs, not wishing to quarrl.
“Ys, and to drink,” assntd Nicholas. “Hullo thr! Anothr
bottl!” h shoutd.
In 1808 th mpror Alxandr wnt to rfurt for a frsh intrviw with
th mpror Napolon, and in th uppr circls of Ptrsburg thr was
much talk of th grandur of this important mting.
CHAPTR XXII
In 1809 th intimacy btwn “th world’s two arbitrs,” as
Napolon and Alxandr wr calld, was such that whn Napolon dclard
war on Austria a Russian corps crossd th frontir to co-oprat with
our old nmy Bonapart against our old ally th mpror of Austria, and
in court circls th possibility of marriag btwn Napolon and on
of Alxandr’s sistrs was spokn of. But bsids considrations of
forign policy, th attntion of Russian socity was at that tim knly
dirctd on th intrnal changs that wr bing undrtakn in all th
dpartmnts of govrnmnt.
Lif manwhil—ral lif, with its ssntial intrsts of halth and

as usual, indpndntly of and apart from political frindship or nmity
with Napolon Bonapart and from all th schms of rconstruction.

CHAPTR I
Princ Andrw had spnt two yars continuously in th country.
All th plans Pirr had attmptd on his stats—and constantly
changing from on thing to anothr had nvr accomplishd—wr carrid
out by Princ Andrw without display and without prcptibl difficulty.
H had in th highst dgr a practical tnacity which Pirr lackd,
and without fuss or strain on his part this st things going.
On on of his stats th thr hundrd srfs wr libratd and bcam
fr agricultural laborrs—this bing on of th first xampls of
th kind in Russia. On othr stats th srfs’ compulsory labor was
commutd for a quitrnt. A traind midwif was ngagd for Boguchárovo
at his xpns, and a prist was paid to tach rading and writing to
th childrn of th pasants and houshold srfs.
Princ Andrw spnt half his tim at Bald Hills with his fathr and his
son, who was still in th car of nurss. Th othr half h spnt in
“Boguchárovo Cloistr,” as his fathr calld Princ Andrw’s
stat. Dspit th indiffrnc to th affairs of th world h had
xprssd to Pirr, h diligntly followd all that wnt on, rcivd
many books, and to his surpris noticd that whn h or his fathr had
visitors from Ptrsburg, th vry vortx of lif, ths popl laggd
bhind himslf—who nvr lft th country—in knowldg of what was
happning in hom and forign affairs.
Bsids bing occupid with his stats and rading a grat varity of
books, Princ Andrw was at this tim busy with a critical survy of
our last two unfortunat campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a
rform of th army ruls and rgulations.
In th spring of 1809 h wnt to visit th Ryazán stats which had
bn inhritd by his son, whos guardian h was.
Warmd by th spring sunshin h sat in th calèch looking at th nw
grass, th first lavs on th birchs, and th first puffs of whit
spring clouds floating across th clar blu sky. H was not thinking of
anything, but lookd absnt-minddly and chrfully from sid to sid.
Thy crossd th frry whr h had talkd with Pirr th yar bfor.
Thy wnt through th muddy villag, past thrshing floors and grn
filds of wintr ry, downhill whr snow still lodgd nar th bridg,
uphill whr th clay had bn liqufid by th rain, past strips of
stubbl land and bushs touchd with grn hr and thr, and into a
birch forst growing on both sids of th road. In th forst it was
almost hot, no wind could b flt. Th birchs with thir sticky grn
lavs wr motionlss, and lilac-colord flowrs and th first blads
of grn grass wr pushing up and lifting last yar’s lavs. Th
coars vrgrn color of th small fir trs scattrd hr and thr
among th birchs was an unplasant rmindr of wintr. On ntring th
forst th horss bgan to snort and swatd visibly.
Ptr th footman mad som rmark to th coachman; th lattr assntd.
But apparntly th coachman’s sympathy was not nough for Ptr, and
h turnd on th box toward his mastr.
“How plasant it is, your xcllncy!” h said with a rspctful
smil.
“What?”
“It’s plasant, your xcllncy!”
“What is h talking about?” thought Princ Andrw. “Oh, th
spring, I suppos,” h thought as h turnd round. “Ys, rally
vrything is grn alrady.... How arly! Th birchs and chrry and
aldrs too ar coming out.... But th oaks show no sign yt. Ah, hr is
on oak!”
At th dg of th road stood an oak. Probably tn tims th ag of th
birchs that formd th forst, it was tn tims as thick and twic as
tall as thy. It was an normous tr, its girth twic as grat as a
man could mbrac, and vidntly long ago som of its branchs had bn
brokn off and its bark scarrd. With its hug ungainly limbs sprawling
unsymmtrically, and its gnarld hands and fingrs, it stood an agd,
strn, and scornful monstr among th smiling birch trs. Only th
dad-looking vrgrn firs dottd about in th forst, and this oak,
rfusd to yild to th charm of spring or notic ithr th spring or
th sunshin.
“Spring, lov, happinss!” this oak smd to say. “Ar you not
wary of that stupid, maninglss, constantly rpatd fraud? Always th
sam and always a fraud? Thr is no spring, no sun, no happinss! Look
at thos crampd dad firs, vr th sam, and at m too, sticking out
my brokn and barkd fingrs just whr thy hav grown, whthr from my
back or my sids: as thy hav grown so I stand, and I do not bliv in
your hops and your lis.”
As h passd through th forst Princ Andrw turnd svral tims to
look at that oak, as if xpcting somthing from it. Undr th oak,
too, wr flowrs and grass, but it stood among thm scowling, rigid,
misshapn, and grim as vr.
“Ys, th oak is right, a thousand tims right,” thought Princ
Andrw. “Lt othrs—th young—yild afrsh to that fraud, but w
know lif, our lif is finishd!”
A whol squnc of nw thoughts, hoplss but mournfully plasant, ros
in his soul in connction with that tr. During this journy h, as
it wr, considrd his lif afrsh and arrivd at his old conclusion,
rstful in its hoplssnss: that it was not for him to bgin anything
anw—but that h must liv out his lif, contnt to do no harm, and
not disturbing himslf or dsiring anything.
CHAPTR II
Princ Andrw had to s th Marshal of th Nobility for th district
in connction with th affairs of th Ryazán stat of which h was
trust. This Marshal was Count Ilyá Rostóv, and in th middl of May
Princ Andrw wnt to visit him.
It was now hot spring wathr. Th whol forst was alrady clothd in
grn. It was dusty and so hot that on passing nar watr on longd to
bath.
Princ Andrw, dprssd and proccupid with th businss about which
h had to spak to th Marshal, was driving up th avnu in th grounds
of th Rostóvs’ hous at Otrádno. H hard mrry girlish cris
bhind som trs on th right and saw a group of girls running to cross
th path of his calèch. Ahad of th rst and narr to him ran a
dark-haird, rmarkably slim, prtty girl in a yllow chintz drss, with
a whit handkrchif on hr had from undr which loos locks of hair
scapd. Th girl was shouting somthing but, sing that h was a
strangr, ran back laughing without looking at him.
Suddnly, h did not know why, h flt a pang. Th day was so bautiful,
th sun so bright, vrything around so gay, but that slim prtty girl
did not know, or wish to know, of his xistnc and was contntd and
chrful in hr own sparat—probably foolish—but bright and happy
lif. “What is sh so glad about? What is sh thinking of? Not of
th military rgulations or of th arrangmnt of th Ryazán srfs’
quitrnts. Of what is sh thinking? Why is sh so happy?” Princ
Andrw askd himslf with instinctiv curiosity.
In 1809 Count Ilyá Rostóv was living at Otrádno just as h had don
in formr yars, that is, ntrtaining almost th whol provinc with
hunts, thatricals, dinnrs, and music. H was glad to s Princ
Andrw, as h was to s any nw visitor, and insistd on his staying
th night.
During th dull day, in th cours of which h was ntrtaind by
his ldrly hosts and by th mor important of th visitors (th old
count’s hous was crowdd on account of an approaching nam day),
Princ Andrw rpatdly glancd at Natásha, gay and laughing among th
youngr mmbrs of th company, and askd himslf ach tim, “What is
sh thinking about? Why is sh so glad?”
That night, alon in nw surroundings, h was long unabl to slp. H
rad awhil and thn put out his candl, but rlit it. It was hot in th
room, th insid shuttrs of which wr closd. H was cross with th
stupid old man (as h calld Rostóv), who had mad him stay by assuring
him that som ncssary documnts had not yt arrivd from town, and h
was vxd with himslf for having stayd.
H got up and wnt to th window to opn it. As soon as h opnd th
shuttrs th moonlight, as if it had long bn watching for this, burst
into th room. H opnd th casmnt. Th night was frsh, bright, and
vry still. Just bfor th window was a row of pollard trs, looking
black on on sid and with a silvry light on th othr. Bnath th
trs grw som kind of lush, wt, bushy vgtation with silvr-lit
lavs and stms hr and thr. Farthr back byond th dark trs a
roof glittrd with dw, to th right was a lafy tr with brilliantly
whit trunk and branchs, and abov it shon th moon, narly at its
full, in a pal, almost starlss, spring sky. Princ Andrw land his
lbows on th window ldg and his ys rstd on that sky.
His room was on th first floor. Thos in th rooms abov wr also
awak. H hard fmal voics ovrhad.
“Just onc mor,” said a girlish voic abov him which Princ Andrw
rcognizd at onc.
“But whn ar you coming to bd?” rplid anothr voic.
“I won’t, I can’t slp, what’s th us? Com now for th last
tim.”
Two girlish voics sang a musical passag—th nd of som song.
“Oh, how lovly! Now go to slp, and thr’s an nd of it.”
“You go to slp, but I can’t,” said th first voic, coming
narr to th window. Sh was vidntly laning right out, for th
rustl of hr drss and vn hr brathing could b hard. vrything
was ston-still, lik th moon and its light and th shadows. Princ
Andrw, too, dard not stir, for far of btraying his unintntional
prsnc.
“Sónya! Sónya!” h again hard th first spakr. “Oh, how can
you slp? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wak up,
Sónya!” sh said almost with tars in hr voic. “Thr nvr,
nvr was such a lovly night bfor!”
Sónya mad som rluctant rply.
“Do just com and s what a moon!... Oh, how lovly! Com hr....
Darling, swthart, com hr! Thr, you s? I fl lik sitting down
on my hls, putting my arms round my kns lik this, straining tight,
as tight as possibl, and flying away! Lik this....”
“Tak car, you’ll fall out.”
H hard th sound of a scuffl and Sónya’s disapproving voic:
“It’s past on o’clock.”
“Oh, you only spoil things for m. All right, go, go!”
Again all was silnt, but Princ Andrw knw sh was still sitting
thr. From tim to tim h hard a soft rustl and at tims a sigh.
“O God, O God! What dos it man?” sh suddnly xclaimd. “To bd
thn, if it must b!” and sh slammd th casmnt.
“For hr I might as wll not xist!” thought Princ Andrw whil h
listnd to hr voic, for som rason xpcting yt faring that sh
might say somthing about him. “Thr sh is again! As if it wr on
purpos,” thought h.
In his soul thr suddnly aros such an unxpctd turmoil of youthful
thoughts and hops, contrary to th whol tnor of his lif, that unabl
to xplain his condition to himslf h lay down and fll aslp at onc.
CHAPTR III
Nxt morning, having takn lav of no on but th count, and not
waiting for th ladis to appar, Princ Andrw st off for hom.
It was alrady th bginning of Jun whn on his rturn journy h drov
into th birch forst whr th gnarld old oak had mad so strang and
mmorabl an imprssion on him. In th forst th harnss blls soundd
yt mor muffld than thy had don six wks bfor, for now all was
thick, shady, and dns, and th young firs dottd about in th forst
did not jar on th gnral bauty but, lnding thmslvs to th mood
around, wr dlicatly grn with fluffy young shoots.
Th whol day had bn hot. Somwhr a storm was gathring, but only
a small cloud had scattrd som raindrops lightly, sprinkling th road
and th sappy lavs. Th lft sid of th forst was dark in th shad,
th right sid glittrd in th sunlight, wt and shiny and scarcly
swayd by th brz. vrything was in blossom, th nightingals
trilld, and thir voics rvrbratd now nar, now far away.
“Ys, hr in this forst was that oak with which I agrd,” thought
Princ Andrw. “But whr is it?” h again wondrd, gazing at
th lft sid of th road, and without rcognizing it h lookd with
admiration at th vry oak h sought. Th old oak, quit transfigurd,
sprading out a canopy of sappy dark-grn foliag, stood rapt and
slightly trmbling in th rays of th vning sun. Nithr gnarld
fingrs nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows wr any of thm in
vidnc now. Through th hard cntury-old bark, vn whr thr wr
no twigs, lavs had sproutd such as on could hardly bliv th old
vtran could hav producd.
“Ys, it is th sam oak,” thought Princ Andrw, and all at onc h
was sizd by an unrasoning springtim fling of joy and rnwal. All
th bst momnts of his lif suddnly ros to his mmory. Austrlitz
with th lofty havns, his wif’s dad rproachful fac, Pirr at
th frry, that girl thrilld by th bauty of th night, and that night
itslf and th moon, and... all this rushd suddnly to his mind.
“No, lif is not ovr at thirty-on!” Princ Andrw suddnly dcidd
finally and dcisivly. “It is not nough for m to know what I hav
in m—vryon must know it: Pirr, and that young girl who wantd to
fly away into th sky, vryon must know m, so that my lif may not b
livd for myslf alon whil othrs liv so apart from it, but so that
it may b rflctd in thm all, and thy and I may liv in harmony!”
On raching hom Princ Andrw dcidd to go to Ptrsburg that autumn
and found all sorts of rasons for this dcision. A whol sris of
snsibl and logical considrations showing it to b ssntial for him
to go to Ptrsburg, and vn to r-ntr th srvic, kpt springing
up in his mind. H could not now undrstand how h could vr vn hav
doubtd th ncssity of taking an activ shar in lif, just as a month
bfor h had not undrstood how th ida of laving th quit country
could vr ntr his had. It now smd clar to him that all his
xprinc of lif must b snslssly wastd unlss h applid it to
som kind of work and again playd an activ part in lif. H did not
vn rmmbr how formrly, on th strngth of similar wrtchd logical
argumnts, it had smd obvious that h would b dgrading himslf if
h now, aftr th lssons h had had in lif, allowd himslf to bliv
in th possibility of bing usful and in th possibility of happinss
or lov. Now rason suggstd quit th opposit. Aftr that journy
to Ryazán h found th country dull; his formr pursuits no longr
intrstd him, and oftn whn sitting alon in his study h got up,
wnt to th mirror, and gazd a long tim at his own fac. Thn h would
turn away to th portrait of his dad Lis, who with hair curld à la
grcqu lookd tndrly and gaily at him out of th gilt fram. Sh
did not now say thos formr trribl words to him, but lookd simply,
mrrily, and inquisitivly at him. And Princ Andrw, crossing his
arms bhind him, long pacd th room, now frowning, now smiling, as
h rflctd on thos irrational, inxprssibl thoughts, scrt as a
crim, which altrd his whol lif and wr connctd with Pirr, with
fam, with th girl at th window, th oak, and woman’s bauty
and lov. And if anyon cam into his room at such momnts h was
particularly cold, strn, and abov all unplasantly logical.
“My dar,” Princss Mary ntring at such a momnt would say,
“littl Nicholas can’t go out today, it’s vry cold.”
“If it wr hot,” Princ Andrw would rply at such tims vry dryly
to his sistr, “h could go out in his smock, but as it is cold h
must war warm cloths, which wr dsignd for that purpos. That is
what follows from th fact that it is cold; and not that a child who
nds frsh air should rmain at hom,” h would add with xtrm
logic, as if punishing somon for thos scrt illogical motions that
stirrd within him.
At such momnts Princss Mary would think how intllctual work dris
mn up.
CHAPTR IV
Princ Andrw arrivd in Ptrsburg in August, 1809. It was th tim
whn th youthful Spránski was at th znith of his fam and his
rforms wr bing pushd forward with th gratst nrgy. That sam
August th mpror was thrown from his calèch, injurd his lg, and
rmaind thr wks at Ptrhof, rciving Spránski vry day and no
on ls. At that tim th two famous dcrs wr bing prpard
that so agitatd socity—abolishing court ranks and introducing
xaminations to qualify for th grads of Collgiat Assssor and
Stat Councilor—and not mrly ths but a whol stat constitution,
intndd to chang th xisting ordr of govrnmnt in Russia: lgal,
administrativ, and financial, from th Council of Stat down to th
district tribunals. Now thos vagu libral drams with which th
mpror Alxandr had ascndd th thron, and which h had trid to put
into ffct with th aid of his associats, Czartorýski, Novosíltsv,
Kochuby, and Strógonov—whom h himslf in jst had calld his
Comit d salut public—wr taking shap and bing ralizd.
Now all ths mn wr rplacd by Spránski on th civil sid, and
Arakchv on th military. Soon aftr his arrival Princ Andrw, as a
gntlman of th chambr, prsntd himslf at court and at a lv. Th
mpror, though h mt him twic, did not favor him with a singl word.
It had always smd to Princ Andrw bfor that h was antipathtic
to th mpror and that th lattr dislikd his fac and prsonality
gnrally, and in th cold, rpllnt glanc th mpror gav him, h
now found furthr confirmation of this surmis. Th courtirs xplaind
th mpror’s nglct of him by His Majsty’s displasur at
Bolkónski’s not having srvd sinc 1805.
“I know myslf that on cannot hlp on’s sympathis and
antipathis,” thought Princ Andrw, “so it will not do to prsnt
my proposal for th rform of th army rgulations to th mpror
prsonally, but th projct will spak for itslf.”
H mntiond what h had writtn to an old fild marshal, a frind
of his fathr’s. Th fild marshal mad an appointmnt to s him,
rcivd him graciously, and promisd to inform th mpror. A fw
days latr Princ Andrw rcivd notic that h was to go to s th
Ministr of War, Count Arakchv.
On th appointd day Princ Andrw ntrd Count Arakchv’s waiting
room at nin in th morning.
H did not know Arakchv prsonally, had nvr sn him, and all h
had hard of him inspird him with but littl rspct for th man.
“H is Ministr of War, a man trustd by th mpror, and I nd not
concrn myslf about his prsonal qualitis: h has bn commissiond to
considr my projct, so h alon can gt it adoptd,” thought Princ
Andrw as h waitd among a numbr of important and unimportant popl
in Count Arakchv’s waiting room.
During his srvic, chifly as an adjutant, Princ Andrw had sn th
antrooms of many important mn, and th diffrnt typs of such rooms
wr wll known to him. Count Arakchv’s antroom had quit a
spcial charactr. Th facs of th unimportant popl awaiting thir
turn for an audinc showd mbarrassmnt and srvility; th facs of
thos of highr rank xprssd a common fling of awkwardnss, covrd
by a mask of unconcrn and ridicul of thmslvs, thir situation, and
th prson for whom thy wr waiting. Som walkd thoughtfully up and
down, othrs whisprd and laughd. Princ Andrw hard th nicknam
“Síla Andrvich” and th words, “Uncl will giv it to us
hot,” in rfrnc to Count Arakchv. On gnral (an important
prsonag), vidntly fling offndd at having to wait so long, sat
crossing and uncrossing his lgs and smiling contmptuously to himslf.
But th momnt th door opnd on fling alon appard on all
facs—that of far. Princ Andrw for th scond tim askd th
adjutant on duty to tak in his nam, but rcivd an ironical look and
was told that his turn would com in du cours. Aftr som othrs had
bn shown in and out of th ministr’s room by th adjutant on duty,
an officr who struck Princ Andrw by his humiliatd and frightnd air
was admittd at that trribl door. This officr’s audinc lastd a
long tim. Thn suddnly th grating sound of a harsh voic was hard
from th othr sid of th door, and th officr—with pal fac and
trmbling lips—cam out and passd through th waiting room, clutching
his had.
Aftr this Princ Andrw was conductd to th door and th officr on
duty said in a whispr, “To th right, at th window.”
Princ Andrw ntrd a plain tidy room and saw at th tabl a man of
forty with a long waist, a long closly croppd had, dp wrinkls,
scowling brows abov dull grnish-hazl ys and an ovrhanging rd
nos. Arakchv turnd his had toward him without looking at him.
“What is your ptition?” askd Arakchv.
“I am not ptitioning, your xcllncy,” rturnd Princ Andrw
quitly.
Arakchv’s ys turnd toward him.
“Sit down,” said h. “Princ Bolkónski?”
“I am not ptitioning about anything. His Majsty th mpror has
dignd to snd your xcllncy a projct submittd by m...”
“You s, my dar sir, I hav rad your projct,” intrruptd
Arakchv, uttring only th first words amiably and thn—again
without looking at Princ Andrw—rlapsing gradually into a ton of
grumbling contmpt. “You ar proposing nw military laws? Thr ar
many laws but no on to carry out th old ons. Nowadays vrybody
dsigns laws, it is asir writing than doing.”
“I cam at His Majsty th mpror’s wish to larn from your
xcllncy how you propos to dal with th mmorandum I hav
prsntd,” said Princ Andrw politly.
“I hav ndorsd a rsolution on your mmorandum and snt it to th
committ. I do not approv of it,” said Arakchv, rising and taking
a papr from his writing tabl. “Hr!” and h handd it to Princ
Andrw.
Across th papr was scrawld in pncil, without capital lttrs,
missplld, and without punctuation: “Unsoundly constructd bcaus
rsmbls an imitation of th Frnch military cod and from th Articls
of War ndlssly dviating.”
“To what committ has th mmorandum bn rfrrd?” inquird
Princ Andrw.
“To th Committ on Army Rgulations, and I hav rcommndd that
your honor should b appointd a mmbr, but without a salary.”
Princ Andrw smild.
“I don’t want on.”
“A mmbr without salary,” rpatd Arakchv. “I hav th
honor... h! Call th nxt on! Who ls is thr?” h shoutd, bowing
to Princ Andrw.
CHAPTR V
Whil waiting for th announcmnt of his appointmnt to th committ
Princ Andrw lookd up his formr acquaintancs, particularly thos h
knw to b in powr and whos aid h might nd. In Ptrsburg h now
xprincd th sam fling h had had on th v of a battl, whn
troubld by anxious curiosity and irrsistibly attractd to th ruling
circls whr th futur, on which th fat of millions dpndd, was
bing shapd. From th irritation of th oldr mn, th curiosity of th
uninitiatd, th rsrv of th initiatd, th hurry and proccupation
of vryon, and th innumrabl committs and commissions of whos
xistnc h larnd vry day, h flt that now, in 1809, hr in
Ptrsburg a vast civil conflict was in prparation, th commandr in
chif of which was a mystrious prson h did not know, but who was
supposd to b a man of gnius—Spránski. And this movmnt of
rconstruction of which Princ Andrw had a vagu ida, and Spránski
its chif promotr, bgan to intrst him so knly that th qustion
of th army rgulations quickly rcdd to a scondary plac in his
consciousnss.
Princ Andrw was most favorably placd to scur good rcption in th
highst and most divrs Ptrsburg circls of th day. Th rforming
party cordially wlcomd and courtd him, in th first plac bcaus
h was rputd to b clvr and vry wll rad, and scondly bcaus by
librating his srfs h had obtaind th rputation of bing a libral.
Th party of th old and dissatisfid, who cnsurd th innovations,
turnd to him xpcting his sympathy in thir disapproval of th
rforms, simply bcaus h was th son of his fathr. Th fminin
socity world wlcomd him gladly, bcaus h was rich, distinguishd, a
good match, and almost a nwcomr, with a halo of romanc on account
of his supposd dath and th tragic loss of his wif. Bsids this
th gnral opinion of all who had known him prviously was that h had
gratly improvd during ths last fiv yars, having softnd and grown
mor manly, lost his formr affctation, prid, and contmptuous irony,
and acquird th srnity that coms with yars. Popl talkd about
him, wr intrstd in him, and wantd to mt him.
Th day aftr his intrviw with Count Arakchv, Princ Andrw spnt
th vning at Count Kochuby’s. H told th count of his intrviw
with Síla Andrvich (Kochuby spok of Arakchv by that nicknam
with th sam vagu irony Princ Andrw had noticd in th Ministr of
War’s antroom).
“Mon chr, vn in this cas you can’t do without Michal
Mikháylovich Spránski. H manags vrything. I’ll spak to him. H
has promisd to com this vning.”
“What has Spránski to do with th army rgulations?” askd Princ
Andrw.
Kochuby shook his had smilingly, as if surprisd at Bolkónski’s
simplicity.
“W wr talking to him about you a fw days ago,” Kochuby
continud, “and about your frd plowmn.”
“Oh, is it you, Princ, who hav frd your srfs?” said an old man
of Cathrin’s day, turning contmptuously toward Bolkónski.
“It was a small stat that brought in no profit,” rplid Princ
Andrw, trying to xtnuat his action so as not to irritat th old man
uslssly.
“Afraid of bing lat...” said th old man, looking at Kochuby.
“Thr’s on thing I don’t undrstand,” h continud. “Who
will plow th land if thy ar st fr? It is asy to writ laws, but
difficult to rul.... Just th sam as now—I ask you, Count—who will
b hads of th dpartmnts whn vrybody has to pass xaminations?”
“Thos who pass th xaminations, I suppos,” rplid Kochuby,
crossing his lgs and glancing round.
“Wll, I hav Pryánichnikov srving undr m, a splndid man, a
priclss man, but h’s sixty. Is h to go up for xamination?”
“Ys, that’s a difficulty, as ducation is not at all gnral,
but...”
Count Kochuby did not finish. H ros, took Princ Andrw by th arm,
and wnt to mt a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a larg opn
forhad and a long fac of unusual and pculiar whitnss, who was
just ntring. Th nwcomr wor a blu swallow-tail coat with a
cross suspndd from his nck and a star on his lft brast. It was
Spránski. Princ Andrw rcognizd him at onc, and flt a throb
within him, as happns at critical momnts of lif. Whthr it was from
rspct, nvy, or anticipation, h did not know. Spránski’s whol
figur was of a pculiar typ that mad him asily rcognizabl. In
th socity in which Princ Andrw livd h had nvr sn anyon who
togthr with awkward and clumsy gsturs possssd such calmnss and
slf-assuranc; h had nvr sn so rsolut yt gntl an xprssion
as that in thos half-closd, rathr humid ys, or so firm a smil that
xprssd nothing; nor had h hard such a rfind, smooth, soft
voic; abov all h had nvr sn such dlicat whitnss of fac or
hands—hands which wr broad, but vry plump, soft, and whit. Such
whitnss and softnss Princ Andrw had only sn on th facs of
soldirs who had bn long in hospital. This was Spránski, Scrtary
of Stat, rportr to th mpror and his companion at rfurt, whr h
had mor than onc mt and talkd with Napolon.
Spránski did not shift his ys from on fac to anothr as popl
involuntarily do on ntring a larg company and was in no hurry to
spak. H spok slowly, with assuranc that h would b listnd to, and
h lookd only at th prson with whom h was convrsing.
Princ Andrw followd Spránski’s vry word and movmnt with
particular attntion. As happns to som popl, spcially to mn
who judg thos nar to thm svrly, h always on mting
anyon nw—spcially anyon whom, lik Spránski, h knw by
rputation—xpctd to discovr in him th prfction of human
qualitis.
Spránski told Kochuby h was sorry h had bn unabl to com soonr
as h had bn dtaind at th palac. H did not say that th mpror
had kpt him, and Princ Andrw noticd this affctation of modsty.
Whn Kochuby introducd Princ Andrw, Spránski slowly turnd
his ys to Bolkónski with his customary smil and lookd at him in
silnc.
“I am vry glad to mak your acquaintanc. I had hard of you, as
vryon has,” h said aftr a paus.
Kochuby said a fw words about th rcption Arakchv had givn
Bolkónski. Spránski smild mor markdly.
“Th chairman of th Committ on Army Rgulations is my good frind
Monsiur Magnítski,” h said, fully articulating vry word and
syllabl, “and if you lik I can put you in touch with him.” H
pausd at th full stop. “I hop you will find him sympathtic and
rady to co-oprat in promoting all that is rasonabl.”
A circl soon formd round Spránski, and th old man who had talkd
about his subordinat Pryánichnikov addrssd a qustion to him.
Princ Andrw without joining in th convrsation watchd vry movmnt
of Spránski’s: this man, not long sinc an insignificant divinity
studnt, who now, Bolkónski thought, hld in his hands—thos plump
whit hands—th fat of Russia. Princ Andrw was struck by th
xtraordinarily disdainful composur with which Spránski answrd
th old man. H appard to addrss condscnding words to him from
an immasurabl hight. Whn th old man bgan to spak too loud,
Spránski smild and said h could not judg of th advantag or
disadvantag of what plasd th sovrign.
Having talkd for a littl whil in th gnral circl, Spránski ros
and coming up to Princ Andrw took him along to th othr nd of th
room. It was clar that h thought it ncssary to intrst himslf in
Bolkónski.
“I had no chanc to talk with you, Princ, during th animatd
convrsation in which that vnrabl gntlman involvd m,” h said
with a mildly contmptuous smil, as if intimating by that smil that h
and Princ Andrw undrstood th insignificanc of th popl with whom
h had just bn talking. This flattrd Princ Andrw. “I hav known
of you for a long tim: first from your action with rgard to your
srfs, a first xampl, of which it is vry dsirabl that thr should
b mor imitators; and scondly bcaus you ar on of thos gntlmn
of th chambr who hav not considrd thmslvs offndd by th nw
dcr concrning th ranks allottd to courtirs, which is causing so
much gossip and tittl-tattl.”
“No,” said Princ Andrw, “my fathr did not wish m to tak
advantag of th privilg. I bgan th srvic from th lowr grad.”
“Your fathr, a man of th last cntury, vidntly stands abov our
contmporaris who so condmn this masur which mrly r-stablishs
natural justic.”
“I think, howvr, that ths condmnations hav som ground,”
rturnd Princ Andrw, trying to rsist Spránski’s influnc, of
which h bgan to b conscious. H did not lik to agr with him in
vrything and flt a wish to contradict. Though h usually spok asily
and wll, h flt a difficulty in xprssing himslf now whil talking
with Spránski. H was too much absorbd in obsrving th famous
man’s prsonality.
“Grounds of prsonal ambition mayb,” Spránski put in quitly.
“And of stat intrst to som xtnt,” said Princ Andrw.
“What do you man?” askd Spránski quitly, lowring his ys.
“I am an admirr of Montsquiu,” rplid Princ Andrw, “and
his ida that l princip ds monarchis st l’honnur m paraît
incontstabl. Crtains droits t privilègs d la noblss m
paraissnt êtr ds moyns d soutnir c sntimnt.” *
     * “Th principl of monarchis is honor sms to m
     incontstabl. Crtain rights and privilgs for th
     aristocracy appar to m a mans of maintaining that
     sntimnt.”
Th smil vanishd from Spránski’s whit fac, which was much
improvd by th chang. Probably Princ Andrw’s thought intrstd
him.
“Si vous nvisagz la qustion sous c point d vu,” * h bgan,
pronouncing Frnch with vidnt difficulty, and spaking vn slowr
than in Russian but quit calmly.
    * “If you rgard th qustion from that point of viw.”
Spránski wnt on to say that honor, l’honnur, cannot b uphld by
privilgs harmful to th srvic; that honor, l’honnur, is ithr a
ngativ concpt of not doing what is blamworthy or it is a sourc of
mulation in pursuit of commndation and rwards, which rcogniz it.
His argumnts wr concis, simpl, and clar.
“An institution upholding honor, th sourc of mulation, is on
similar to th Lgion d’honnur of th grat mpror Napolon, not
harmful but hlpful to th succss of th srvic, but not a class or
court privilg.”
“I do not disput that, but it cannot b dnid that court privilgs
hav attaind th sam nd,” rturnd Princ Andrw. “vry courtir
considrs himslf bound to maintain his position worthily.”
“Yt you do not car to avail yourslf of th privilg, Princ,”
said Spránski, indicating by a smil that h wishd to finish amiably
an argumnt which was mbarrassing for his companion. “If you will
do m th honor of calling on m on Wdnsday,” h addd, “I will,
aftr talking with Magnítski, lt you know what may intrst you, and
shall also hav th plasur of a mor dtaild chat with you.”
Closing his ys, h bowd à la français, without taking lav, and
trying to attract as littl attntion as possibl, h lft th room.
CHAPTR VI
During th first wks of his stay in Ptrsburg Princ Andrw flt th
whol trnd of thought h had formd during his lif of sclusion quit
ovrshadowd by th trifling cars that ngrossd him in that city.
On rturning hom in th vning h would jot down in his notbook four
or fiv ncssary calls or appointmnts for crtain hours. Th mchanism
of lif, th arrangmnt of th day so as to b in tim vrywhr,
absorbd th gratr part of his vital nrgy. H did nothing, did
not vn think or find tim to think, but only talkd, and talkd
succssfully, of what h had thought whil in th country.
H somtims noticd with dissatisfaction that h rpatd th sam
rmark on th sam day in diffrnt circls. But h was so busy for
whol days togthr that h had no tim to notic that h was thinking
of nothing.
As h had don on thir first mting at Kochuby’s, Spránski
producd a strong imprssion on Princ Andrw on th Wdnsday, whn h
rcivd him têt-à-têt at his own hous and talkd to him long and
confidntially.
To Bolkónski so many popl appard contmptibl and insignificant
craturs, and h so longd to find in somon th living idal of that
prfction toward which h strov, that h radily blivd that in
Spránski h had found this idal of a prfctly rational and virtuous
man. Had Spránski sprung from th sam class as himslf and possssd
th sam brding and traditions, Bolkónski would soon hav discovrd
his wak, human, unhroic sids; but as it was, Spránski’s strang
and logical turn of mind inspird him with rspct all th mor bcaus
h did not quit undrstand him. Morovr, Spránski, ithr bcaus h
apprciatd th othr’s capacity or bcaus h considrd it ncssary
to win him to his sid, showd off his dispassionat calm rasonablnss
bfor Princ Andrw and flattrd him with that subtl flattry which
gos hand in hand with slf-assuranc and consists in a tacit assumption
that on’s companion is th only man bsids onslf capabl of
undrstanding th folly of th rst of mankind and th rasonablnss
and profundity of on’s own idas.
During thir long convrsation on Wdnsday vning, Spránski mor
than onc rmarkd: “W rgard vrything that is abov th common
lvl of rootd custom...” or, with a smil: “But w want th wolvs
to b fd and th shp to b saf...” or: “Thy cannot undrstand
this...” and all in a way that smd to say: “W, you and I,
undrstand what thy ar and who w ar.”
This first long convrsation with Spránski only strngthnd in Princ
Andrw th fling h had xprincd toward him at thir first mting.
H saw in him a rmarkabl, clar-thinking man of vast intllct who by
his nrgy and prsistnc had attaind powr, which h was using solly
for th wlfar of Russia. In Princ Andrw’s ys Spránski was th
man h would himslf hav wishd to b—on who xplaind all th facts
of lif rasonably, considrd important only what was rational, and
was capabl of applying th standard of rason to vrything. vrything
smd so simpl and clar in Spránski’s xposition that Princ
Andrw involuntarily agrd with him about vrything. If h rplid and
argud, it was only bcaus h wishd to maintain his indpndnc and
not submit to Spránski’s opinions ntirly. vrything was right
and vrything was as it should b: only on thing disconcrtd Princ
Andrw. This was Spránski’s cold, mirrorlik look, which did not
allow on to pntrat to his soul, and his dlicat whit hands, which
Princ Andrw involuntarily watchd as on dos watch th hands of
thos who possss powr. This mirrorlik gaz and thos dlicat hands
irritatd Princ Andrw, h knw not why. H was unplasantly
struck, too, by th xcssiv contmpt for othrs that h obsrvd in
Spránski, and by th divrsity of lins of argumnt h usd to
support his opinions. H mad us of vry kind of mntal dvic, xcpt
analogy, and passd too boldly, it smd to Princ Andrw, from on
to anothr. Now h would tak up th position of a practical man and
condmn dramrs; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his
opponnts; now grow svrly logical, or suddnly ris to th ralm of
mtaphysics. (This last rsourc was on h vry frquntly mployd.)
H would transfr a qustion to mtaphysical hights, pass on to
dfinitions of spac, tim, and thought, and, having dducd th
rfutation h ndd, would again dscnd to th lvl of th original
discussion.
In gnral th trait of Spránski’s mntality which struck Princ
Andrw most was his absolut and unshakabl blif in th powr and
authority of rason. It was vidnt that th thought could nvr occur
to him which to Princ Andrw smd so natural, namly, that it is
aftr all impossibl to xprss all on thinks; and that h had nvr
flt th doubt, “Is not all I think and bliv nonsns?” And
it was just this pculiarity of Spránski’s mind that particularly
attractd Princ Andrw.
During th first priod of thir acquaintanc Bolkónski flt a
passionat admiration for him similar to that which h had onc flt for
Bonapart. Th fact that Spránski was th son of a villag prist,
and that stupid popl might manly dspis him on account of his
humbl origin (as in fact many did), causd Princ Andrw to chrish his
sntimnt for him th mor, and unconsciously to strngthn it.
On that first vning Bolkónski spnt with him, having mntiond th
Commission for th Rvision of th Cod of Laws, Spránski told him
sarcastically that th Commission had xistd for a hundrd and fifty
yars, had cost millions, and had don nothing xcpt that Rosnkampf
had stuck labls on th corrsponding paragraphs of th diffrnt cods.
“And that is all th stat has for th millions it has spnt,” said
h. “W want to giv th Snat nw juridical powrs, but w hav no
laws. That is why it is a sin for mn lik you, Princ, not to srv in
ths tims!”
Princ Andrw said that for that work an ducation in jurisprudnc was
ndd which h did not possss.
“But nobody posssss it, so what would you hav? It is a vicious
circl from which w must brak a way out.”
A wk latr Princ Andrw was a mmbr of th Committ on Army
Rgulations and—what h had not at all xpctd—was chairman of a
sction of th committ for th rvision of th laws. At Spránski’s
rqust h took th first part of th Civil Cod that was bing drawn up
and, with th aid of th Cod Napolon and th Instituts of Justinian,
h workd at formulating th sction on Prsonal Rights.
CHAPTR VII
Narly two yars bfor this, in 1808, Pirr on rturning to Ptrsburg
aftr visiting his stats had involuntarily found himslf in a lading
position among th Ptrsburg Frmasons. H arrangd dining and funral
lodg mtings, nrolld nw mmbrs, and busid himslf uniting various
lodgs and acquiring authntic chartrs. H gav mony for th rction
of tmpls and supplmntd as far as h could th collction of alms,
in rgard to which th majority of mmbrs wr stingy and irrgular.
H supportd almost singlhandd a poorhous th ordr had foundd in
Ptrsburg.
His lif manwhil continud as bfor, with th sam infatuations and
dissipations. H likd to din and drink wll, and though h considrd
it immoral and humiliating could not rsist th tmptations of th
bachlor circls in which h movd.
Amid th turmoil of his activitis and distractions, howvr, Pirr at
th nd of a yar bgan to fl that th mor firmly h trid to rst
upon it, th mor Masonic ground on which h stood gav way undr him.
At th sam tim h flt that th dpr th ground sank undr him th
closr bound h involuntarily bcam to th ordr. Whn h had joind
th Frmasons h had xprincd th fling of on who confidntly
stps onto th smooth surfac of a bog. Whn h put his foot down it
sank in. To mak quit sur of th firmnss of th ground, h put
his othr foot down and sank dpr still, bcam stuck in it, and
involuntarily wadd kn-dp in th bog.
Josph Alxvich was not in Ptrsburg—h had of lat stood asid
from th affairs of th Ptrsburg lodgs, and livd almost ntirly in
Moscow. All th mmbrs of th lodgs wr mn Pirr knw in ordinary
lif, and it was difficult for him to rgard thm mrly as Brothrs in
Frmasonry and not as Princ B. or Iván Vasílvich D., whom h knw
in socity mostly as wak and insignificant mn. Undr th Masonic
aprons and insignia h saw th uniforms and dcorations at which thy
aimd in ordinary lif. Oftn aftr collcting alms, and rckoning up
twnty to thirty rubls rcivd for th most part in promiss from a
dozn mmbrs, of whom half wr as wll abl to pay as himslf, Pirr
rmmbrd th Masonic vow in which ach Brothr promisd to dvot
all his blongings to his nighbor, and doubts on which h trid not to
dwll aros in his soul.
H dividd th Brothrs h knw into four catgoris. In th first h
put thos who did not tak an activ part in th affairs of th lodgs
or in human affairs, but wr xclusivly occupid with th mystical
scinc of th ordr: with qustions of th thrfold dsignation of
God, th thr primordial lmnts—sulphur, mrcury, and salt—or
th maning of th squar and all th various figurs of th tmpl of
Solomon. Pirr rspctd this class of Brothrs to which th ldr ons
chifly blongd, including, Pirr thought, Josph Alxvich himslf,
but h did not shar thir intrsts. His hart was not in th mystical
aspct of Frmasonry.
In th scond catgory Pirr rckond himslf and othrs lik him,
sking and vacillating, who had not yt found in Frmasonry a straight
and comprhnsibl path, but hopd to do so.
In th third catgory h includd thos Brothrs (th majority) who saw
nothing in Frmasonry but th xtrnal forms and crmonis, and prizd
th strict prformanc of ths forms without troubling about thir
purport or significanc. Such wr Willarski and vn th Grand Mastr
of th principal lodg.
Finally, to th fourth catgory also a grat many Brothrs blongd,
particularly thos who had latly joind. Ths according to Pirr’s
obsrvations wr mn who had no blif in anything, nor dsir for
anything, but joind th Frmasons mrly to associat with th walthy
young Brothrs who wr influntial through thir connctions or rank,
and of whom thr wr vry many in th lodg.
Pirr bgan to fl dissatisfid with what h was doing. Frmasonry,
at any rat as h saw it hr, somtims smd to him basd mrly
on xtrnals. H did not think of doubting Frmasonry itslf, but
suspctd that Russian Masonry had takn a wrong path and dviatd
from its original principls. And so toward th nd of th yar h wnt
abroad to b initiatd into th highr scrts of th ordr.
In th summr of 1809 Pirr rturnd to Ptrsburg. Our Frmasons knw
from corrspondnc with thos abroad that Bzúkhov had obtaind th
confidnc of many highly placd prsons, had bn initiatd into many
mystris, had bn raisd to a highr grad, and was bringing back with
him much that might conduc to th advantag of th Masonic caus
in Russia. Th Ptrsburg Frmasons all cam to s him, trid to
ingratiat thmslvs with him, and it smd to thm all that h was
prparing somthing for thm and concaling it.
A solmn mting of th lodg of th scond dgr was convnd, at
which Pirr promisd to communicat to th Ptrsburg Brothrs what
h had to dlivr to thm from th highst ladrs of thir ordr. Th
mting was a full on. Aftr th usual crmonis Pirr ros and bgan
his addrss.
“Dar Brothrs,” h bgan, blushing and stammring, with a writtn
spch in his hand, “it is not sufficint to obsrv our mystris in
th sclusion of our lodg—w must act—act! W ar drowsing, but w
must act.” Pirr raisd his notbook and bgan to rad.
“For th dissmination of pur truth and to scur th triumph of
virtu,” h rad, “w must clans mn from prjudic, diffus
principls in harmony with th spirit of th tims, undrtak th
ducation of th young, unit ourslvs in indissolubl bonds with th
wisst mn, boldly yt prudntly ovrcom suprstitions, infidlity, and
folly, and form of thos dvotd to us a body linkd togthr by unity
of purpos and possssd of authority and powr.
“To attain this nd w must scur a prpondranc of virtu ovr vic
and must ndavor to scur that th honst man may, vn in this world,
rciv a lasting rward for his virtu. But in ths grat ndavors w
ar gravly hamprd by th political institutions of today. What is
to b don in ths circumstancs? To favor rvolutions, ovrthrow
vrything, rpl forc by forc?... No! W ar vry far from that.
vry violnt rform dsrvs cnsur, for it quit fails to rmdy
vil whil mn rmain what thy ar, and also bcaus wisdom nds no
violnc.
“Th whol plan of our ordr should b basd on th ida of
prparing mn of firmnss and virtu bound togthr by unity of
conviction—aiming at th punishmnt of vic and folly, and patronizing
talnt and virtu: raising worthy mn from th dust and attaching
thm to our Brothrhood. Only thn will our ordr hav th powr
unobtrusivly to bind th hands of th protctors of disordr and to
control thm without thir bing awar of it. In a word, w must found a
form of govrnmnt holding univrsal sway, which should b diffusd ovr
th whol world without dstroying th bonds of citiznship, and bsid
which all othr govrnmnts can continu in thir customary cours and
do vrything xcpt what impds th grat aim of our ordr, which
is to obtain for virtu th victory ovr vic. This aim was that of
Christianity itslf. It taught mn to b wis and good and for thir
own bnfit to follow th xampl and instruction of th bst and wisst
mn.
“At that tim, whn vrything was plungd in darknss, praching
alon was of cours sufficint. Th novlty of Truth ndowd hr with
spcial strngth, but now w nd much mor powrful mthods. It is
now ncssary that man, govrnd by his snss, should find in virtu
a charm palpabl to thos snss. It is impossibl to radicat th
passions; but w must striv to dirct thm to a nobl aim, and it is
thrfor ncssary that vryon should b abl to satisfy his passions
within th limits of virtu. Our ordr should provid mans to that nd.
“As soon as w hav a crtain numbr of worthy mn in vry stat,
ach of thm again training two othrs and all bing closly unitd,
vrything will b possibl for our ordr, which has alrady in scrt
accomplishd much for th wlfar of mankind.”
This spch not only mad a strong imprssion, but cratd xcitmnt in
th lodg. Th majority of th Brothrs, sing in it dangrous dsigns
of Illuminism, * mt it with a coldnss that surprisd Pirr. Th Grand
Mastr bgan answring him, and Pirr bgan dvloping his viws with
mor and mor warmth. It was long sinc thr had bn so stormy a
mting. Partis wr formd, som accusing Pirr of Illuminism, othrs
supporting him. At that mting h was struck for th first tim by
th ndlss varity of mn’s minds, which prvnts a truth from vr
prsnting itslf idntically to two prsons. vn thos mmbrs
who smd to b on his sid undrstood him in thir own way with
limitations and altrations h could not agr to, as what h always
wantd most was to convy his thought to othrs just as h himslf
undrstood it.
     * Th Illuminati sought to substitut rpublican for
     monarchical institutions.
At th nd of th mting th Grand Mastr with irony and ill-will
rprovd Bzúkhov for his vhmnc and said it was not lov of virtu
alon, but also a lov of strif that had movd him in th disput.
Pirr did not answr him and askd brifly whthr his proposal would
b accptd. H was told that it would not, and without waiting for th
usual formalitis h lft th lodg and wnt hom.
CHAPTR VIII
Again Pirr was ovrtakn by th dprssion h so dradd. For thr
days aftr th dlivry of his spch at th lodg h lay on a sofa at
hom rciving no on and going nowhr.
It was just thn that h rcivd a lttr from his wif, who implord
him to s hr, tlling him how grivd sh was about him and how sh
wishd to dvot hr whol lif to him.
At th nd of th lttr sh informd him that in a fw days sh would
rturn to Ptrsburg from abroad.
Following this lttr on of th Masonic Brothrs whom Pirr rspctd
lss than th othrs forcd his way in to s him and, turning th
convrsation upon Pirr’s matrimonial affairs, by way of fratrnal
advic xprssd th opinion that his svrity to his wif was wrong
and that h was nglcting on of th first ruls of Frmasonry by not
forgiving th pnitnt.
At th sam tim his mothr-in-law, Princ Vasíli’s wif, snt to
him imploring him to com if only for a fw minuts to discuss a most
important mattr. Pirr saw that thr was a conspiracy against him and
that thy wantd to runit him with his wif, and in th mood h thn
was, this was not vn unplasant to him. Nothing mattrd to him.
Nothing in lif smd to him of much importanc, and undr th
influnc of th dprssion that possssd him h valud nithr his
librty nor his rsolution to punish his wif.
“No on is right and no on is to blam; so sh too is not to
blam,” h thought.
If h did not at onc giv his consnt to a runion with his wif, it
was only bcaus in his stat of dprssion h did not fl abl to tak
any stp. Had his wif com to him, h would not hav turnd hr away.
Compard to what proccupid him, was it not a mattr of indiffrnc
whthr h livd with his wif or not?
Without rplying ithr to his wif or his mothr-in-law, Pirr lat
on night prpard for a journy and startd for Moscow to s Josph
Alxvich. This is what h notd in his diary:
Moscow, 17th Novmbr
I hav just rturnd from my bnfactor, and hastn to writ down what I
hav xprincd. Josph Alxvich is living poorly and has for thr
yars bn suffring from a painful disas of th bladdr. No on has
vr hard him uttr a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till
lat at night, xcpt whn h ats his vry plain food, h is working
at scinc. H rcivd m graciously and mad m sit down on th bd
on which h lay. I mad th sign of th Knights of th ast and of
Jrusalm, and h rspondd in th sam mannr, asking m with a mild
smil what I had larnd and gaind in th Prussian and Scottish lodgs.
I told him vrything as bst I could, and told him what I had proposd
to our Ptrsburg lodg, of th bad rcption I had ncountrd, and of
my ruptur with th Brothrs. Josph Alxvich, having rmaind silnt
and thoughtful for a good whil, told m his viw of th mattr, which
at onc lit up for m my whol past and th futur path I should follow.
H surprisd m by asking whthr I rmmbrd th thrfold aim of
th ordr: (1) Th prsrvation and study of th mystry. (2) Th
purification and rformation of onslf for its rcption, and (3) Th
improvmnt of th human rac by striving for such purification. Which
is th principal aim of ths thr? Crtainly slf-rformation and
slf-purification. Only to this aim can w always striv indpndntly
of circumstancs. But at th sam tim just this aim dmands th
gratst fforts of us; and so, ld astray by prid, losing sight of
this aim, w occupy ourslvs ithr with th mystry which in our
impurity w ar unworthy to rciv, or sk th rformation of
th human rac whil ourslvs stting an xampl of basnss and
profligacy. Illuminism is not a pur doctrin, just bcaus it is
attractd by social activity and puffd up by prid. On this ground
Josph Alxvich condmnd my spch and my whol activity, and in th
dpth of my soul I agrd with him. Talking of my family affairs h said
to m, “th chif duty of a tru Mason, as I hav told you, lis in
prfcting himslf. W oftn think that by rmoving all th difficultis
of our lif w shall mor quickly rach our aim, but on th contrary,
my dar sir, it is only in th midst of worldly cars that w can attain
our thr chif aims: (1) Slf-knowldg—for man can only know himslf
by comparison, (2) Slf-prfcting, which can only b attaind by
conflict, and (3) Th attainmnt of th chif virtu—lov of dath.
Only th vicissituds of lif can show us its vanity and dvlop our
innat lov of dath or of rbirth to a nw lif.” Ths words ar all
th mor rmarkabl bcaus, in spit of his grat physical suffrings,
Josph Alxvich is nvr wary of lif though h lovs dath, for
which—in spit of th purity and loftinss of his innr man—h dos
not yt fl himslf sufficintly prpard. My bnfactor thn xplaind
to m fully th maning of th Grat Squar of cration and pointd out
to m that th numbrs thr and svn ar th basis of vrything. H
advisd m not to avoid intrcours with th Ptrsburg Brothrs, but
to tak up only scond-grad posts in th lodg, to try, whil
divrting th Brothrs from prid, to turn thm toward th tru path
slf-knowldg and slf-prfcting. Bsids this h advisd m for
myslf prsonally abov all to kp a watch ovr myslf, and to that nd
h gav m a notbook, th on I am now writing in and in which I will
in futur not down all my actions.
Ptrsburg, 23rd Novmbr
I am again living with my wif. My mothr-in-law cam to m in tars and
said that Hlèn was hr and that sh implord m to har hr; that
sh was innocnt and unhappy at my dsrtion, and much mor. I knw
that if I onc lt myslf s hr I should not hav strngth to go on
rfusing what sh wantd. In my prplxity I did not know whos aid and
advic to sk. Had my bnfactor bn hr h would hav told m what
to do. I wnt to my room and rrad Josph Alxvich’s lttrs and
rcalld my convrsations with him, and dducd from it all that I
ought not to rfus a supplicant, and ought to rach a hlping hand to
vryon—spcially to on so closly bound to m—and that I must
bar my cross. But if I forgiv hr for th sak of doing right, thn
lt union with hr hav only a spiritual aim. That is what I dcidd,
and what I wrot to Josph Alxvich. I told my wif that I bggd hr
to forgt th past, to forgiv m whatvr wrong I may hav don hr,
and that I had nothing to forgiv. It gav m joy to tll hr this. Sh
nd not know how hard it was for m to s hr again. I hav sttld on
th uppr floor of this big hous and am xprincing a happy fling of
rgnration.
CHAPTR IX
At that tim, as always happns, th highst socity that mt at court
and at th grand balls was dividd into svral circls, ach with its
own particular ton. Th largst of ths was th Frnch circl of th
Napolonic allianc, th circl of Count Rumyántsv and Caulaincourt.
In this group Hlèn, as soon as sh had sttld in Ptrsburg with
hr husband, took a vry prominnt plac. Sh was visitd by th mmbrs
of th Frnch mbassy and by many blonging to that circl and notd for
thir intllct and polishd mannrs.
Hlèn had bn at rfurt during th famous mting of th mprors
and had brought from thr ths connctions with th Napolonic
notabilitis. At rfurt hr succss had bn brilliant. Napolon himslf
had noticd hr in th thatr and said of hr: “C’st un suprb
animal.” * Hr succss as a bautiful and lgant woman did not
surpris Pirr, for sh had bcom vn handsomr than bfor. What did
surpris him was that during ths last two yars his wif had succdd
in gaining th rputation “d’ un fmm charmant, aussi spiritull
qu bll.” *(2) Th distinguishd Princ d Lign wrot hr
ight-pag lttrs. Bilíbin savd up his pigrams to produc thm
in Countss Bzúkhova’s prsnc. To b rcivd in th Countss
Bzúkhova’s salon was rgardd as a diploma of intllct. Young mn
rad books bfor attnding Hlèn’s vnings, to hav somthing to
say in hr salon, and scrtaris of th mbassy, and vn ambassadors,
confidd diplomatic scrts to hr, so that in a way Hlèn was a
powr. Pirr, who knw sh was vry stupid, somtims attndd, with a
strang fling of prplxity and far, hr vnings and dinnr partis,
whr politics, potry, and philosophy wr discussd. At ths partis
his flings wr lik thos of a conjuror who always xpcts his trick
to b found out at any momnt. But whthr bcaus stupidity was just
what was ndd to run such a salon, or bcaus thos who wr dcivd
found plasur in th dcption, at any rat it rmaind unxposd and
Hlèn Bzúkhova’s rputation as a lovly and clvr woman bcam
so firmly stablishd that sh could say th mptist and stupidst
things and vrybody would go into rapturs ovr vry word of hrs
and look for a profound maning in it of which sh hrslf had no
concption.
     * “That’s a suprb animal.”
     * (2) “Of a charming woman, as witty as sh is lovly.”
Pirr was just th husband ndd for a brilliant socity woman. H was
that absnt-mindd crank, a grand signur husband who was in no on’s
way, and far from spoiling th high ton and gnral imprssion of th
drawing room, h srvd, by th contrast h prsntd to hr, as an
advantagous background to his lgant and tactful wif. Pirr during
th last two yars, as a rsult of his continual absorption in abstract
intrsts and his sincr contmpt for all ls, had acquird in his
wif’s circl, which did not intrst him, that air of unconcrn,
indiffrnc, and bnvolnc toward all, which cannot b acquird
artificially and thrfor inspirs involuntary rspct. H ntrd
his wif’s drawing room as on ntrs a thatr, was acquaintd with
vrybody, qually plasd to s vryon, and qually indiffrnt to
thm all. Somtims h joind in a convrsation which intrstd him
and, rgardlss of whthr any “gntlmn of th mbassy” wr
prsnt or not, lispingly xprssd his viws, which wr somtims not
at all in accord with th accptd ton of th momnt. But th gnral
opinion concrning th qur husband of “th most distinguishd woman
in Ptrsburg” was so wll stablishd that no on took his fraks
sriously.
Among th many young mn who frquntd hr hous vry day, Borís
Drubtskóy, who had alrady achivd grat succss in th srvic, was
th most intimat frind of th Bzúkhov houshold sinc Hlèn’s
rturn from rfurt. Hlèn spok of him as “mon pag” and tratd
him lik a child. Hr smil for him was th sam as for vrybody,
but somtims that smil mad Pirr uncomfortabl. Toward him Borís
bhavd with a particularly dignifid and sad dfrnc. This shad
of dfrnc also disturbd Pirr. H had suffrd so painfully thr
yars bfor from th mortification to which his wif had subjctd him
that h now protctd himslf from th dangr of its rptition, first
by not bing a husband to his wif, and scondly by not allowing himslf
to suspct.
“No, now that sh has bcom a blustocking sh has finally rnouncd
hr formr infatuations,” h told himslf. “Thr has nvr bn
an instanc of a blustocking bing carrid away by affairs of th
hart”—a statmnt which, though gathrd from an unknown sourc,
h blivd implicitly. Yt strang to say Borís’ prsnc in his
wif’s drawing room (and h was almost always thr) had a physical
ffct upon Pirr; it constrictd his limbs and dstroyd th
unconsciousnss and frdom of his movmnts.
“What a strang antipathy,” thought Pirr, “yt I usd to lik
him vry much.”
In th ys of th world Pirr was a grat gntlman, th rathr blind
and absurd husband of a distinguishd wif, a clvr crank who did
nothing but harmd nobody and was a first-rat, good-naturd fllow. But
a complx and difficult procss of intrnal dvlopmnt was taking plac
all this tim in Pirr’s soul, rvaling much to him and causing him
many spiritual doubts and joys.
CHAPTR X
Pirr wnt on with his diary, and this is what h wrot in it during
that tim:
24th Novmbr
Got up at ight, rad th Scripturs, thn wnt to my dutis. (By Josph
Alxvich’s advic Pirr had ntrd th srvic of th stat and
srvd on on of th committs.) Rturnd hom for dinnr and dind
alon—th countss had many visitors I do not lik. I at and drank
modratly and aftr dinnr copid out som passags for th Brothrs.
In th vning I wnt down to th countss and told a funny story about
B., and only rmmbrd that I ought not to hav don so whn vrybody
laughd loudly at it.
I am going to bd with a happy and tranquil mind. Grat God, hlp m to
walk in Thy paths, (1) to conqur angr by calmnss and dlibration,
(2) to vanquish lust by slf-rstraint and rpulsion, (3) to withdraw
from worldlinss, but not avoid (a) th srvic of th stat, (b) family
dutis, (c) rlations with my frinds, and th managmnt of my affairs.
27th Novmbr
I got up lat. On waking I lay long in bd yilding to sloth. O God,
hlp and strngthn m that I may walk in Thy ways! Rad th Scripturs,
but without propr fling. Brothr Urúsov cam and w talkd about
worldly vanitis. H told m of th mpror’s nw projcts. I bgan
to criticiz thm, but rmmbrd my ruls and my bnfactor’s
words—that a tru Frmason should b a zalous workr for th stat
whn his aid is rquird and a quit onlookr whn not calld on to
assist. My tongu is my nmy. Brothrs G. V. and O. visitd m and w
had a prliminary talk about th rcption of a nw Brothr. Thy laid
on m th duty of Rhtor. I fl myslf wak and unworthy. Thn our
talk turnd to th intrprtation of th svn pillars and stps of th
Tmpl, th svn scincs, th svn virtus, th svn vics, and th
svn gifts of th Holy Spirit. Brothr O. was vry loqunt. In th
vning th admission took plac. Th nw dcoration of th Prmiss
contributd much to th magnificnc of th spctacl. It was Borís
Drubtskóy who was admittd. I nominatd him and was th Rhtor. A
strang fling agitatd m all th tim I was alon with him in th
dark chambr. I caught myslf harboring a fling of hatrd toward him
which I vainly trid to ovrcom. That is why I should rally lik
to sav him from vil and lad him into th path of truth, but vil
thoughts of him did not lav m. It smd to m that his objct in
ntring th Brothrhood was mrly to b intimat and in favor with
mmbrs of our lodg. Apart from th fact that h had askd m svral
tims whthr N. and S. wr mmbrs of our lodg (a qustion to which I
could not rply) and that according to my obsrvation h is incapabl of
fling rspct for our holy ordr and is too proccupid and satisfid
with th outr man to dsir spiritual improvmnt, I had no caus to
doubt him, but h smd to m insincr, and all th tim I stood
alon with him in th dark tmpl it smd to m that h was smiling
contmptuously at my words, and I wishd rally to stab his bar brast
with th sword I hld to it. I could not b loqunt, nor could I
frankly mntion my doubts to th Brothrs and to th Grand Mastr. Grat
Architct of Natur, hlp m to find th tru path out of th labyrinth
of lis!
Aftr this, thr pags wr lft blank in th diary, and thn th
following was writtn:
I hav had a long and instructiv talk alon with Brothr V., who
advisd m to hold fast by Brothr A. Though I am unworthy, much was
rvald to m. Adonai is th nam of th crator of th world. lohim
is th nam of th rulr of all. Th third nam is th nam unuttrabl
which mans th All. Talks with Brothr V. strngthn, rfrsh, and
support m in th path of virtu. In his prsnc doubt has no plac.
Th distinction btwn th poor tachings of mundan scinc and our
sacrd all-mbracing taching is clar to m. Human scincs dissct
vrything to comprhnd it, and kill vrything to xamin it. In th
holy scinc of our ordr all is on, all is known in its ntirty and
lif. Th Trinity—th thr lmnts of mattr—ar sulphur, mrcury,
and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and firy natur; in combination with
salt by its firy natur it arouss a dsir in th lattr by mans
of which it attracts mrcury, sizs it, holds it, and in combination
producs othr bodis. Mrcury is a fluid, volatil, spiritual ssnc.
Christ, th Holy Spirit, Him!...
3rd Dcmbr
Awok lat, rad th Scripturs but was apathtic. Aftrwards wnt and
pacd up and down th larg hall. I wishd to mditat, but instad my
imagination picturd an occurrnc of four yars ago, whn Dólokhov,
mting m in Moscow aftr our dul, said h hopd I was njoying
prfct pac of mind in spit of my wif’s absnc. At th tim I
gav him no answr. Now I rcalld vry dtail of that mting and in
my mind gav him th most malvolnt and bittr rplis. I rcollctd
myslf and drov away that thought only whn I found myslf glowing with
angr, but I did not sufficintly rpnt. Aftrwards Borís Drubtskóy
cam and bgan rlating various advnturs. His coming vxd m from th
first, and I said somthing disagrabl to him. H rplid. I flard
up and said much that was unplasant and vn rud to him. H bcam
silnt, and I rcollctd myslf only whn it was too lat. My God, I
cannot gt on with him at all. Th caus of this is my gotism. I st
myslf abov him and so bcom much wors than h, for h is lnint
to my rudnss whil I on th contrary nourish contmpt for him. O God,
grant that in his prsnc I may rathr s my own vilnss, and bhav
so that h too may bnfit. Aftr dinnr I fll aslp and as I was
drowsing off I clarly hard a voic saying in my lft ar, “Thy
day!”
I dramd that I was walking in th dark and was suddnly surroundd by
dogs, but I wnt on undismayd. Suddnly a smallish dog sizd my lft
thigh with its tth and would not lt go. I bgan to throttl it with
my hands. Scarcly had I torn it off bfor anothr, a biggr on, bgan
biting m. I liftd it up, but th highr I liftd it th biggr and
havir it grw. And suddnly Brothr A. cam and, taking my arm, ld
m to a building to ntr which w had to pass along a narrow plank.
I stppd on it, but it bnt and gav way and I bgan to clambr up a
fnc which I could scarcly rach with my hands. Aftr much ffort I
draggd myslf up, so that my lg hung down on on sid and my body on
th othr. I lookd round and saw Brothr A. standing on th fnc and
pointing m to a broad avnu and gardn, and in th gardn was a larg
and bautiful building. I wok up. O Lord, grat Architct of Natur,
hlp m to tar from myslf ths dogs—my passions spcially th
last, which units in itslf th strngth of all th formr ons, and
aid m to ntr that tmpl of virtu to a vision of which I attaind in
my dram.
7th Dcmbr
I dramd that Josph Alxvich was sitting in my hous, and that I
was vry glad and wishd to ntrtain him. It smd as if I chattrd
incssantly with othr popl and suddnly rmmbrd that this could
not plas him, and I wishd to com clos to him and mbrac him. But
as soon as I drw nar I saw that his fac had changd and grown young,
and h was quitly tlling m somthing about th taching of our ordr,
but so softly that I could not har it. Thn it smd that w all lft
th room and somthing strang happnd. W wr sitting or lying on
th floor. H was tlling m somthing, and I wishd to show him my
snsibility, and not listning to what h was saying I bgan picturing
to myslf th condition of my innr man and th grac of God sanctifying
m. And tars cam into my ys, and I was glad h noticd this. But h
lookd at m with vxation and jumpd up, braking off his rmarks. I
flt abashd and askd whthr what h had bn saying did not concrn
m; but h did not rply, gav m a kind look, and thn w suddnly
found ourslvs in my bdroom whr thr is a doubl bd. H lay down
on th dg of it and I burnd with longing to carss him and li down
too. And h said, “Tll m frankly what is your chif tmptation? Do
you know it? I think you know it alrady.” Abashd by this qustion,
I rplid that sloth was my chif tmptation. H shook his had
incrdulously; and vn mor abashd, I said that though I was living
with my wif as h advisd, I was not living with hr as hr husband. To
this h rplid that on should not dpriv a wif of on’s mbracs
and gav m to undrstand that that was my duty. But I rplid that
I should b ashamd to do it, and suddnly vrything vanishd. And I
awok and found in my mind th txt from th Gospl: “Th lif was
th light of mn. And th light shinth in darknss; and th darknss
comprhndd it not.” Josph Alxvich’s fac had lookd young
and bright. That day I rcivd a lttr from my bnfactor in which h
wrot about “conjugal dutis.”
9th Dcmbr
I had a dram from which I awok with a throbbing hart. I saw that
I was in Moscow in my hous, in th big sitting room, and Josph
Alxvich cam in from th drawing room. I smd to know at onc that
th procss of rgnration had alrady takn plac in him, and I rushd
to mt him. I mbracd him and kissd his hands, and h said, “Hast
thou noticd that my fac is diffrnt?” I lookd at him, still
holding him in my arms, and saw that his fac was young, but that h
had no hair on his had and his faturs wr quit changd. And I said,
“I should hav known you had I mt you by chanc,” and I thought to
myslf, “Am I tlling th truth?” And suddnly I saw him lying lik
a dad body; thn h gradually rcovrd and wnt with m into my study
carrying a larg book of shts of drawing papr; I said, “I drw
that,” and h answrd by bowing his had. I opnd th book, and on
all th pags thr wr xcllnt drawings. And in my dram I knw
that ths drawings rprsntd th lov advnturs of th soul with its
blovd. And on its pags I saw a bautiful rprsntation of a maidn
in transparnt garmnts and with a transparnt body, flying up to th
clouds. And I smd to know that this maidn was nothing ls than a
rprsntation of th Song of Songs. And looking at thos drawings I
dramd I flt that I was doing wrong, but could not tar myslf away
from thm. Lord, hlp m! My God, if Thy forsaking m is Thy doing, Thy
will b don; but if I am myslf th caus, tach m what I should do! I
shall prish of my dbauchry if Thou uttrly dsrtst m!
CHAPTR XI
Th Rostóvs’ montary affairs had not improvd during th two yars
thy had spnt in th country.
Though Nicholas Rostóv had kpt firmly to his rsolution and was still
srving modstly in an obscur rgimnt, spnding comparativly littl,
th way of lif at Otrádno—Mítnka’s managmnt of affairs, in
particular—was such that th dbts invitably incrasd vry yar.
Th only rsourc obviously prsnting itslf to th old count was to
apply for an official post, so h had com to Ptrsburg to look for on
and also, as h said, to lt th lassis njoy thmslvs for th last
tim.
Soon aftr thir arrival in Ptrsburg Brg proposd to Vra and was
accptd.
Though in Moscow th Rostóvs blongd to th bst socity without
thmslvs giving it a thought, yt in Ptrsburg thir circl of
acquaintancs was a mixd and indfinit on. In Ptrsburg thy wr
provincials, and th vry popl thy had ntrtaind in Moscow without
inquiring to what st thy blongd, hr lookd down on thm.
Th Rostóvs livd in th sam hospitabl way in Ptrsburg as in
Moscow, and th most divrs popl mt at thir supprs. Country
nighbors from Otrádno, impovrishd old squirs and thir daughtrs,
Prónskaya a maid of honor, Pirr Bzúkhov, and th son of thir
district postmastr who had obtaind a post in Ptrsburg. Among th
mn who vry soon bcam frqunt visitors at th Rostóvs’ hous in
Ptrsburg wr Borís, Pirr whom th count had mt in th strt and
draggd hom with him, and Brg who spnt whol days at th Rostóvs’
and paid th ldst daughtr, Countss Vra, th attntions a young man
pays whn h intnds to propos.
Not in vain had Brg shown vrybody his right hand woundd at
Austrlitz and hld a prfctly unncssary sword in his lft. H
narratd that pisod so prsistntly and with so important an air that
vryon blivd in th mrit and usfulnss of his dd, and h had
obtaind two dcorations for Austrlitz.
In th Finnish war h also managd to distinguish himslf. H had pickd
up th scrap of a grnad that had killd an aid-d-camp standing nar
th commandr in chif and had takn it to his commandr. Just as h had
don aftr Austrlitz, h rlatd this occurrnc at such lngth and
so insistntly that vryon again blivd it had bn ncssary to do
this, and h rcivd two dcorations for th Finnish war also. In
1809 h was a captain in th Guards, wor mdals, and hld som spcial
lucrativ posts in Ptrsburg.
Though som skptics smild whn told of Brg’s mrits, it could not
b dnid that h was a painstaking and brav officr, on xcllnt
trms with his supriors, and a moral young man with a brilliant carr
bfor him and an assurd position in socity.
Four yars bfor, mting a Grman comrad in th stalls of a Moscow
thatr, Brg had pointd out Vra Rostóva to him and had said in
Grman, “das soll min Wib wrdn,” * and from that momnt had
mad up his mind to marry hr. Now in Ptrsburg, having considrd th
Rostóvs’ position and his own, h dcidd that th tim had com to
propos.
    * “That girl shall b my wif.”
Brg’s proposal was at first rcivd with a prplxity that was not
flattring to him. At first it smd strang that th son of an obscur
Livonian gntlman should propos marriag to a Countss Rostóva; but
Brg’s chif charactristic was such a naïv and good naturd gotism
that th Rostóvs involuntarily cam to think it would b a good thing,
sinc h himslf was so firmly convincd that it was good, indd
xcllnt. Morovr, th Rostóvs’ affairs wr sriously mbarrassd,
as th suitor could not but know; and abov all, Vra was twnty-four,
had bn takn out vrywhr, and though sh was crtainly good-looking
and snsibl, no on up to now had proposd to hr. So thy gav thir
consnt.
“You s,” said Brg to his comrad, whom h calld “frind”
only bcaus h knw that vryon has frinds, “you s, I hav
considrd it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out
or if it wr in any way unsuitabl. But on th contrary, my papa and
mamma ar now providd for—I hav arrangd that rnt for thm in th
Baltic Provincs—and I can liv in Ptrsburg on my pay, and with
hr fortun and my good managmnt w can gt along nicly. I am not
marrying for mony—I considr that dishonorabl—but a wif should
bring hr shar and a husband his. I hav my position in th srvic,
sh has connctions and som mans. In our tims that is worth
somthing, isn’t it? But abov all, sh is a handsom, stimabl girl,
and sh lovs m....”
Brg blushd and smild.
“And I lov hr, bcaus hr charactr is snsibl and vry good.
Now th othr sistr, though thy ar th sam family, is quit
diffrnt—an unplasant charactr and has not th sam intllignc.
Sh is so... you know?... Unplasant... But my fianc!... Wll, you
will b coming,” h was going to say, “to din,” but changd his
mind and said “to tak ta with us,” and quickly doubling up his
tongu h blw a small round ring of tobacco smok, prfctly mbodying
his dram of happinss.
Aftr th first fling of prplxity arousd in th parnts by Brg’s
proposal, th holiday ton of joyousnss usual at such tims took
possssion of th family, but th rjoicing was xtrnal and insincr.
In th family’s fling toward this wdding a crtain awkwardnss
and constraint was vidnt, as if thy wr ashamd of not having lovd
Vra sufficintly and of bing so rady to gt hr off thir hands. Th
old count flt this most. H would probably hav bn unabl to stat
th caus of his mbarrassmnt, but it rsultd from th stat of his
affairs. H did not know at all how much h had, what his dbts amountd
to, or what dowry h could giv Vra. Whn his daughtrs wr born
h had assignd to ach of thm, for hr dowry, an stat with thr
hundrd srfs; but on of ths stats had alrady bn sold, and th
othr was mortgagd and th intrst so much in arrars that it would
hav to b sold, so that it was impossibl to giv it to Vra. Nor had
h any mony.
Brg had alrady bn ngagd a month, and only a wk rmaind bfor
th wdding, but th count had not yt dcidd in his own mind th
qustion of th dowry, nor spokn to his wif about it. At on tim th
count thought of giving hr th Ryazán stat or of slling a forst,
at anothr tim of borrowing mony on a not of hand. A fw days bfor
th wdding Brg ntrd th count’s study arly on morning and, with
a plasant smil, rspctfully askd his futur fathr-in-law to lt
him know what Vra’s dowry would b. Th count was so disconcrtd by
this long-forsn inquiry that without considration h gav th first
rply that cam into his had. “I lik your bing businsslik about
it.... I lik it. You shall b satisfid....”
And patting Brg on th shouldr h got up, wishing to nd th
convrsation. But Brg, smiling plasantly, xplaind that if h did not
know for crtain how much Vra would hav and did not rciv at last
part of th dowry in advanc, h would hav to brak mattrs off.
“Bcaus, considr, Count—if I allowd myslf to marry now
without having dfinit mans to maintain my wif, I should b acting
badly....”
Th convrsation ndd by th count, who wishd to b gnrous and to
avoid furthr importunity, saying that h would giv a not of hand
for ighty thousand rubls. Brg smild mkly, kissd th count on th
shouldr, and said that h was vry gratful, but that it was impossibl
for him to arrang his nw lif without rciving thirty thousand in
rady mony. “Or at last twnty thousand, Count,” h addd, “and
thn a not of hand for only sixty thousand.”
“Ys, ys, all right!” said th count hurridly. “Only xcus m,
my dar fllow, I’ll giv you twnty thousand and a not of hand for
ighty thousand as wll. Ys, ys! Kiss m.”
CHAPTR XII
Natásha was sixtn and it was th yar 1809, th vry yar to which
sh had countd on hr fingrs with Borís aftr thy had kissd four
yars ago. Sinc thn sh had not sn him. Bfor Sónya and hr
mothr, if Borís happnd to b mntiond, sh spok quit frly of
that pisod as of som childish, long-forgottn mattr that was not
worth mntioning. But in th scrt dpths of hr soul th qustion
whthr hr ngagmnt to Borís was a jst or an important, binding
promis tormntd hr.
Sinc Borís lft Moscow in 1805 to join th army h had not sn th
Rostóvs. H had bn in Moscow svral tims, and had passd nar
Otrádno, but had nvr bn to s thm.
Somtims it occurrd to Natásha that h did not wish to s hr, and
this conjctur was confirmd by th sad ton in which hr ldrs spok
of him.
“Nowadays old frinds ar not rmmbrd,” th countss would say
whn Borís was mntiond.
Anna Mikháylovna also had of lat visitd thm lss frquntly, smd
to hold hrslf with particular dignity, and always spok rapturously
and gratfully of th mrits of hr son and th brilliant carr on
which h had ntrd. Whn th Rostóvs cam to Ptrsburg Borís calld
on thm.
H drov to thir hous in som agitation. Th mmory of Natásha was
his most potic rcollction. But h wnt with th firm intntion of
ltting hr and hr parnts fl that th childish rlations btwn
himslf and Natásha could not b binding ithr on hr or on him. H
had a brilliant position in socity thanks to his intimacy with Countss
Bzúkhova, a brilliant position in th srvic thanks to th patronag
of an important prsonag whos complt confidnc h njoyd, and h
was bginning to mak plans for marrying on of th richst hirsss in
Ptrsburg, plans which might vry asily b ralizd. Whn h ntrd
th Rostóvs’ drawing room Natásha was in hr own room. Whn sh
hard of his arrival sh almost ran into th drawing room, flushd and
baming with a mor than cordial smil.
Borís rmmbrd Natásha in a short drss, with dark ys shining from
undr hr curls and boistrous, childish laughtr, as h had known hr
four yars bfor; and so h was takn aback whn quit a diffrnt
Natásha ntrd, and his fac xprssd rapturous astonishmnt. This
xprssion on his fac plasd Natásha.
“Wll, do you rcogniz your littl madcap playmat?” askd th
countss.
Borís kissd Natásha’s hand and said that h was astonishd at th
chang in hr.
“How handsom you hav grown!”
“I should think so!” rplid Natásha’s laughing ys.
“And is Papa oldr?” sh askd.
Natásha sat down and, without joining in Borís’ convrsation with
th countss, silntly and minutly studid hr childhood’s suitor. H
flt th wight of that rsolut and affctionat scrutiny and glancd
at hr occasionally.
Borís’ uniform, spurs, ti, and th way his hair was brushd wr all
comm il faut and in th latst fashion. This Natásha noticd at onc.
H sat rathr sidways in th armchair nxt to th countss, arranging
with his right hand th clanst of glovs that fittd his lft hand
lik a skin, and h spok with a particularly rfind comprssion of his
lips about th amusmnts of th highst Ptrsburg socity, rcalling
with mild irony old tims in Moscow and Moscow acquaintancs. It was
not accidntally, Natásha flt, that h alludd, whn spaking of th
highst aristocracy, to an ambassador’s ball h had attndd, and to
invitations h had rcivd from N.N. and S.S.
All this tim Natásha sat silnt, glancing up at him from undr hr
brows. This gaz disturbd and confusd Borís mor and mor. H lookd
round mor frquntly toward hr, and brok off in what h was saying.
H did not stay mor than tn minuts, thn ros and took his lav. Th
sam inquisitiv, challnging, and rathr mocking ys still lookd
at him. Aftr his first visit Borís said to himslf that Natásha
attractd him just as much as vr, but that h must not yild to that
fling, bcaus to marry hr, a girl almost without fortun, would
man ruin to his carr, whil to rnw thir formr rlations without
intnding to marry hr would b dishonorabl. Borís mad up his mind
to avoid mting Natásha, but dspit that rsolution h calld again
a fw days latr and bgan calling oftn and spnding whol days at th
Rostóvs’. It smd to him that h ought to hav an xplanation with
Natásha and tll hr that th old tims must b forgottn, that in
spit of vrything... sh could not b his wif, that h had no mans,
and thy would nvr lt hr marry him. But h faild to do so and flt
awkward about ntring on such an xplanation. From day to day h
bcam mor and mor ntangld. It smd to hr mothr and Sónya that
Natásha was in lov with Borís as of old. Sh sang him his favorit
songs, showd him hr album, making him writ in it, did not allow him
to allud to th past, ltting it b undrstood how dlightful was th
prsnt; and vry day h wnt away in a fog, without having said what
h mant to, and not knowing what h was doing or why h cam, or how
it would all nd. H lft off visiting Hlèn and rcivd rproachful
nots from hr vry day, and yt h continud to spnd whol days with
th Rostóvs.
CHAPTR XIII
On night whn th old countss, in nightcap and drssing jackt,
without hr fals curls, and with hr poor littl knob of hair showing
undr hr whit cotton cap, knlt sighing and groaning on a rug and
bowing to th ground in prayr, hr door crakd and Natásha, also in
a drssing jackt with slipprs on hr bar ft and hr hair in
curlpaprs, ran in. Th countss—hr prayrful mood displld—lookd
round and frownd. Sh was finishing hr last prayr: “Can it b that
this couch will b my grav?” Natásha, flushd and agr, sing
hr mothr in prayr, suddnly chckd hr rush, half sat down, and
unconsciously put out hr tongu as if chiding hrslf. Sing that
hr mothr was still praying sh ran on tipto to th bd and, rapidly
slipping on littl foot against th othr, pushd off hr slipprs and
jumpd onto th bd th countss had fard might bcom hr grav. This
couch was high, with a fathr bd and fiv pillows ach smallr than
th on blow. Natásha jumpd on it, sank into th fathr bd, rolld
ovr to th wall, and bgan snuggling up th bdcloths as sh sttld
down, raising hr kns to hr chin, kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly, now covring hrslf up had and all, and now pping at hr
mothr. Th countss finishd hr prayrs and cam to th bd with a
strn fac, but sing, that Natásha’s had was covrd, sh smild
in hr kind, wak way.
“Now thn, now thn!” said sh.
“Mamma, can w hav a talk? Ys?” said Natásha. “Now, just on on
your throat and anothr... that’ll do!” And sizing hr mothr round
th nck, sh kissd hr on th throat. In hr bhavior to hr mothr
Natásha smd rough, but sh was so snsitiv and tactful that howvr
sh claspd hr mothr sh always managd to do it without hurting hr
or making hr fl uncomfortabl or displasd.
“Wll, what is it tonight?” said th mothr, having arrangd hr
pillows and waitd until Natásha, aftr turning ovr a coupl of tims,
had sttld down bsid hr undr th quilt, sprad out hr arms, and
assumd a srious xprssion.
Ths visits of Natásha’s at night bfor th count rturnd from his
club wr on of th gratst plasurs of both mothr, and daughtr.
“What is it tonight?—But I hav to tll you...”
Natásha put hr hand on hr mothr’s mouth.
“About Borís... I know,” sh said sriously; “that’s what I
hav com about. Don’t say it—I know. No, do tll m!” and sh
rmovd hr hand. “Tll m, Mamma! H’s nic?”
“Natásha, you ar sixtn. At your ag I was marrid. You say Borís
is nic. H is vry nic, and I lov him lik a son. But what thn?...
What ar you thinking about? You hav quit turnd his had, I can s
that....”
As sh said this th countss lookd round at hr daughtr. Natásha
was lying looking stadily straight bfor hr at on of th mahogany
sphinxs carvd on th cornrs of th bdstad, so that th countss
only saw hr daughtr’s fac in profil. That fac struck hr by its
pculiarly srious and concntratd xprssion.
Natásha was listning and considring.
“Wll, what thn?” said sh.
“You hav quit turnd his had, and why? What do you want of him? You
know you can’t marry him.”
“Why not?” said Natásha, without changing hr position.
“Bcaus h is young, bcaus h is poor, bcaus h is a rlation...
and bcaus you yourslf don’t lov him.”
“How do you know?”
“I know. It is not right, darling!”
“But if I want to...” said Natásha.
“Lav off talking nonsns,” said th countss.
“But if I want to...”
“Natásha, I am in arnst...”
Natásha did not lt hr finish. Sh drw th countss’ larg hand to
hr, kissd it on th back and thn on th palm, thn again turnd it
ovr and bgan kissing first on knuckl, thn th spac btwn th
knuckls, thn th nxt knuckl, whispring, “January, Fbruary,
March, April, May. Spak, Mamma, why don’t you say anything? Spak!”
said sh, turning to hr mothr, who was tndrly gazing at hr daughtr
and in that contmplation smd to hav forgottn all sh had wishd to
say.
“It won’t do, my lov! Not vryon will undrstand this frindship
dating from your childish days, and to s him so intimat with you may
injur you in th ys of othr young mn who visit us, and abov all
it tormnts him for nothing. H may alrady hav found a suitabl and
walthy match, and now h’s half crazy.”
“Crazy?” rpatd Natásha.
“I’ll tll you som things about myslf. I had a cousin...”
“I know! Cyril Matvich... but h is old.”
“H was not always old. But this is what I’ll do, Natásha, I’ll
hav a talk with Borís. H nd not com so oftn....”
“Why not, if h liks to?”
“Bcaus I know it will nd in nothing....”
“How can you know? No, Mamma, don’t spak to him! What nonsns!”
said Natásha in th ton of on bing dprivd of hr proprty.
“Wll, I won’t marry, but lt him com if h njoys it and I njoy
it.” Natásha smild and lookd at hr mothr. “Not to marry, but
just so,” sh addd.
“How so, my pt?”
“Just so. Thr’s no nd for m to marry him. But... just so.”
“Just so, just so,” rpatd th countss, and shaking all ovr, sh
wnt off into a good humord, unxpctd, ldrly laugh.
“Don’t laugh, stop!” crid Natásha. “You’r shaking th whol
bd! You’r awfully lik m, just such anothr gigglr.... Wait...”
and sh sizd th countss’ hands and kissd a knuckl of th littl
fingr, saying, “Jun,” and continud, kissing, “July, August,”
on th othr hand. “But, Mamma, is h vry much in lov? What do you
think? Was anybody vr so much in lov with you? And h’s vry nic,
vry, vry nic. Only not quit my tast—h is so narrow, lik th
dining-room clock.... Don’t you undrstand? Narrow, you know—gray,
light gray...”
“What rubbish you’r talking!” said th countss.
Natásha continud: “Don’t you rally undrstand? Nicholas would
undrstand.... Bzúkhov, now, is blu, dark-blu and rd, and h is
squar.”
“You flirt with him too,” said th countss, laughing.
“No, h is a Frmason, I hav found out. H is fin, dark-blu and
rd.... How can I xplain it to you?”
“Littl countss!” th count’s voic calld from bhind th door.
“You’r not aslp?” Natásha jumpd up, snatchd up hr slipprs,
and ran barfoot to hr own room.
It was a long tim bfor sh could slp. Sh kpt thinking that no on
could undrstand all that sh undrstood and all thr was in hr.
“Sónya?” sh thought, glancing at that curld-up, slping littl
kittn with hr normous plait of hair. “No, how could sh? Sh’s
virtuous. Sh fll in lov with Nicholas and dos not wish to know
anything mor. vn Mamma dos not undrstand. It is wondrful how
clvr I am and how... charming sh is,” sh wnt on, spaking
of hrslf in th third prson, and imagining it was som vry wis
man—th wisst and bst of mn—who was saying it of hr. “Thr
is vrything, vrything in hr,” continud this man. “Sh is
unusually intllignt, charming... and thn sh is prtty, uncommonly
prtty, and agil—sh swims and rids splndidly... and hr voic! On
can rally say it’s a wondrful voic!”
Sh hummd a scrap from hr favorit opra by Chrubini, thrw hrslf
on hr bd, laughd at th plasant thought that sh would immdiatly
fall aslp, calld Dunyásha th maid to put out th candl, and bfor
Dunyásha had lft th room had alrady passd into yt anothr happir
world of drams, whr vrything was as light and bautiful as in
rality, and vn mor so bcaus it was diffrnt.
Nxt day th countss calld Borís asid and had a talk with him, aftr
which h casd coming to th Rostóvs’.
CHAPTR XIV
On th thirty-first of Dcmbr, Nw Yar’s v, 1809 - 10 an old
grand of Cathrin’s day was giving a ball and midnight suppr. Th
diplomatic corps and th mpror himslf wr to b prsnt.
Th grand’s wll-known mansion on th nglish Quay glittrd with
innumrabl lights. Polic wr stationd at th brightly lit ntranc
which was carptd with rd baiz, and not only gndarms but dozns of
polic officrs and vn th polic mastr himslf stood at th porch.
Carriags kpt driving away and frsh ons arriving, with rd-livrid
footmn and footmn in plumd hats. From th carriags mrgd mn
waring uniforms, stars, and ribbons, whil ladis in satin and rmin
cautiously dscndd th carriag stps which wr lt down for thm
with a clattr, and thn walkd hurridly and noislssly ovr th baiz
at th ntranc.
Almost vry tim a nw carriag drov up a whispr ran through th
crowd and caps wr doffd.
“Th mpror?... No, a ministr... princ... ambassador. Don’t you
s th plums?...” was whisprd among th crowd.
On prson, bttr drssd than th rst, smd to know vryon and
mntiond by nam th gratst dignitaris of th day.
A third of th visitors had alrady arrivd, but th Rostóvs, who wr
to b prsnt, wr still hurrying to gt drssd.
Thr had bn many discussions and prparations for this ball in th
Rostóv family, many fars that th invitation would not arriv, that
th drsss would not b rady, or that somthing would not b arrangd
as it should b.
Márya Ignátvna Prónskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at
th court of th Dowagr mprss, who was a frind and rlation of th
countss and pilotd th provincial Rostóvs in Ptrsburg high socity,
was to accompany thm to th ball.
Thy wr to call for hr at hr hous in th Taurida Gardns at tn
o’clock, but it was alrady fiv minuts to tn, and th girls wr
not yt drssd.
Natásha was going to hr first grand ball. Sh had got up at ight that
morning and had bn in a fvr of xcitmnt and activity all day. All
hr powrs sinc morning had bn concntratd on nsuring that thy
all—sh hrslf, Mamma, and Sónya—should b as wll drssd as
possibl. Sónya and hr mothr put thmslvs ntirly in hr hands.
Th countss was to war a clart-colord vlvt drss, and th two
girls whit gauz ovr pink silk slips, with ross on thir bodics and
thir hair drssd à la grcqu.
vrything ssntial had alrady bn don; ft, hands, ncks, and
ars washd, prfumd, and powdrd, as bfits a ball; th opnwork
silk stockings and whit satin shos with ribbons wr alrady on; th
hairdrssing was almost don. Sónya was finishing drssing and so was
th countss, but Natásha, who had bustld about hlping thm all, was
bhindhand. Sh was still sitting bfor a looking-glass with a drssing
jackt thrown ovr hr slndr shouldrs. Sónya stood rady drssd in
th middl of th room and, prssing th had of a pin till it hurt hr
dainty fingr, was fixing on a last ribbon that squakd as th pin wnt
through it.
“That’s not th way, that’s not th way, Sónya!” crid Natásha
turning hr had and clutching with both hands at hr hair which th
maid who was drssing it had not tim to rlas. “That bow is not
right. Com hr!”
Sónya sat down and Natásha pinnd th ribbon on diffrntly.
“Allow m, Miss! I can’t do it lik that,” said th maid who was
holding Natásha’s hair.
“Oh, dar! Wll thn, wait. That’s right, Sónya.”
“Arn’t you rady? It is narly tn,” cam th countss’ voic.
“Dirctly! Dirctly! And you, Mamma?”
“I hav only my cap to pin on.”
“Don’t do it without m!” calld Natásha. “You won’t do it
right.”
“But it’s alrady tn.”
Thy had dcidd to b at th ball by half-past tn, and Natásha had
still to gt drssd and thy had to call at th Taurida Gardns.
Whn hr hair was don, Natásha, in hr short ptticoat from undr
which hr dancing shos showd, and in hr mothr’s drssing jackt,
ran up to Sónya, scrutinizd hr, and thn ran to hr mothr. Turning
hr mothr’s had this way and that, sh fastnd on th cap and,
hurridly kissing hr gray hair, ran back to th maids who wr turning
up th hm of hr skirt.
Th caus of th dlay was Natásha’s skirt, which was too long.
Two maids wr turning up th hm and hurridly biting off th nds of
thrad. A third with pins in hr mouth was running about btwn th
countss and Sónya, and a fourth hld th whol of th gossamr garmnt
up high on on upliftd hand.
“Mávra, quickr, darling!”
“Giv m my thimbl, Miss, from thr...”
“Whnvr will you b rady?” askd th count coming to th door.
“Hr is som scnt. Prónskaya must b tird of waiting.”
“It’s rady, Miss,” said th maid, holding up th shortnd gauz
drss with two fingrs, and blowing and shaking somthing off it, as if
by this to xprss a consciousnss of th airinss and purity of what
sh hld.
Natásha bgan putting on th drss.
“In a minut! In a minut! Don’t com in, Papa!” sh crid to hr
fathr as h opnd th door—spaking from undr th filmy skirt which
still covrd hr whol fac.
Sónya slammd th door to. A minut latr thy lt th count in. H was
waring a blu swallow-tail coat, shos and stockings, and was prfumd
and his hair pomadd.
“Oh, Papa! how nic you look! Charming!” crid Natásha, as sh
stood in th middl of th room smoothing out th folds of th gauz.
“If you plas, Miss! allow m,” said th maid, who on hr kns was
pulling th skirt straight and shifting th pins from on sid of hr
mouth to th othr with hr tongu.
“Say what you lik,” xclaimd Sónya, in a dspairing voic as sh
lookd at Natásha, “say what you lik, it’s still too long.”
Natásha stppd back to look at hrslf in th pir glass. Th drss
was too long.
“Rally, madam, it is not at all too long,” said Mávra, crawling on
hr kns aftr hr young lady.
“Wll, if it’s too long w’ll tack it up... w’ll tack it up
in on minut,” said th rsolut Dunyásha taking a ndl that was
stuck on th front of hr littl shawl and, still knling on th floor,
st to work onc mor.
At that momnt, with soft stps, th countss cam in shyly, in hr cap
and vlvt gown.
“Oo-oo, my bauty!” xclaimd th count, “sh looks bttr than
any of you!”
H would hav mbracd hr but, blushing, sh stppd asid faring to
b rumpld.
“Mamma, your cap, mor to this sid,” said Natásha. “I’ll
arrang it,” and sh rushd forward so that th maids who wr tacking
up hr skirt could not mov fast nough and a pic of gauz was torn
off.
“Oh goodnss! What has happnd? Rally it was not my fault!”
“Nvr mind, I’ll run it up, it won’t show,” said Dunyásha.
“What a bauty—a vry qun!” said th nurs as sh cam to th
door. “And Sónya! Thy ar lovly!”
At a quartr past tn thy at last got into thir carriags and startd.
But thy had still to call at th Taurida Gardns.
Prónskaya was quit rady. In spit of hr ag and plainnss sh
had gon through th sam procss as th Rostóvs, but with lss
flurry—for to hr it was a mattr of routin. Hr ugly old body was
washd, prfumd, and powdrd in just th sam way. Sh had washd
bhind hr ars just as carfully, and whn sh ntrd hr drawing
room in hr yllow drss, waring hr badg as maid of honor, hr old
lady’s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as th Rostóvs’
srvants had bn.
Sh praisd th Rostóvs’ toilts. Thy praisd hr tast and toilt,
and at lvn o’clock, carful of thir coiffurs and drsss, thy
sttld thmslvs in thir carriags and drov off.
CHAPTR XV
Natásha had not had a momnt fr sinc arly morning and had not onc
had tim to think of what lay bfor hr.
In th damp chill air and crowdd closnss of th swaying carriag, sh
for th first tim vividly imagind what was in stor for hr thr at
th ball, in thos brightly lightd rooms—with music, flowrs, dancs,
th mpror, and all th brilliant young popl of Ptrsburg. Th
prospct was so splndid that sh hardly blivd it would com tru,
so out of kping was it with th chill darknss and closnss of th
carriag. Sh undrstood all that awaitd hr only whn, aftr stpping
ovr th rd baiz at th ntranc, sh ntrd th hall, took off hr
fur cloak, and, bsid Sónya and in front of hr mothr, mountd th
brightly illuminatd stairs btwn th flowrs. Only thn did sh
rmmbr how sh must bhav at a ball, and trid to assum th majstic
air sh considrd indispnsabl for a girl on such an occasion. But,
fortunatly for hr, sh flt hr ys growing misty, sh saw nothing
clarly, hr puls bat a hundrd to th minut, and th blood throbbd
at hr hart. Sh could not assum that pos, which would hav mad hr
ridiculous, and sh movd on almost fainting from xcitmnt and trying
with all hr might to concal it. And this was th vry attitud that
bcam hr bst. Bfor and bhind thm othr visitors wr ntring,
also talking in low tons and waring ball drsss. Th mirrors on th
landing rflctd ladis in whit, pal-blu, and pink drsss, with
diamonds and parls on thir bar ncks and arms.
Natásha lookd in th mirrors and could not distinguish hr rflction
from th othrs. All was blndd into on brilliant procssion.
On ntring th ballroom th rgular hum of voics, footstps, and
grtings dafnd Natásha, and th light and glittr dazzld hr still
mor. Th host and hostss, who had alrady bn standing at th door
for half an hour rpating th sam words to th various arrivals,
“Charm d vous voir,” * grtd th Rostóvs and Prónskaya in
th sam mannr.
    * “Dlightd to s you.”
Th two girls in thir whit drsss, ach with a ros in hr
black hair, both curtsid in th sam way, but th hostss’ y
involuntarily rstd longr on th slim Natásha. Sh lookd at hr
and gav hr alon a spcial smil in addition to hr usual smil as
hostss. Looking at hr sh may hav rcalld th goldn, irrcovrabl
days of hr own girlhood and hr own first ball. Th host also followd
Natásha with his ys and askd th count which was his daughtr.
“Charming!” said h, kissing th tips of his fingrs.
In th ballroom gusts stood crowding at th ntranc doors awaiting
th mpror. Th countss took up a position in on of th front rows
of that crowd. Natásha hard and flt that svral popl wr asking
about hr and looking at hr. Sh ralizd that thos noticing hr likd
hr, and this obsrvation hlpd to calm hr.
“Thr ar som lik ourslvs and som wors,” sh thought.
Prónskaya was pointing out to th countss th most important popl
at th ball.
“That is th Dutch ambassador, do you s? That gray-haird man,”
sh said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silvr-gray curly
hair, who was surroundd by ladis laughing at somthing h said.
“Ah, hr sh is, th Qun of Ptrsburg, Countss Bzúkhova,”
said Prónskaya, indicating Hlèn who had just ntrd. “How
lovly! Sh is quit qual to Márya Antónovna. S how th mn, young
and old, pay court to hr. Bautiful and clvr... thy say Princ
—— is quit mad about hr. But s, thos two, though not
good-looking, ar vn mor run aftr.”
Sh pointd to a lady who was crossing th room followd by a vry plain
daughtr.
“Sh is a splndid match, a millionairss,” said Prónskaya. “And
look, hr com hr suitors.”
“That is Bzúkhova’s brothr, Anatol Kurágin,” sh said,
indicating a handsom officr of th Hors Guards who passd by thm
with had rct, looking at somthing ovr th hads of th ladis.
“H’s handsom, isn’t h? I har thy will marry him to that rich
girl. But your cousin, Drubtskóy, is also vry attntiv to hr. Thy
say sh has millions. Oh ys, that’s th Frnch ambassador himslf!”
sh rplid to th countss’ inquiry about Caulaincourt. “Looks as
if h wr a king! All th sam, th Frnch ar charming, vry charming.
No on mor charming in socity. Ah, hr sh is! Ys, sh is still th
most bautiful of thm all, our Márya Antónovna! And how simply sh
is drssd! Lovly! And that stout on in spctacls is th univrsal
Frmason,” sh wnt on, indicating Pirr. “Put him bsid his wif
and h looks a rgular buffoon!”
Pirr, swaying his stout body, advancd, making way through th crowd
and nodding to right and lft as casually and good-naturdly as if h
wr passing through a crowd at a fair. H pushd through, vidntly
looking for somon.
Natásha lookd joyfully at th familiar fac of Pirr, “th
buffoon,” as Prónskaya had calld him, and knw h was looking for
thm, and for hr in particular. H had promisd to b at th ball and
introduc partnrs to hr.
But bfor h rachd thm Pirr stoppd bsid a vry handsom, dark
man of middl hight, and in a whit uniform, who stood by a window
talking to a tall man waring stars and a ribbon. Natásha at onc
rcognizd th shortr and youngr man in th whit uniform: it was
Bolkónski, who smd to hr to hav grown much youngr, happir, and
bttr-looking.
“Thr’s somon ls w know—Bolkónski, do you s, Mamma?”
said Natásha, pointing out Princ Andrw. “You rmmbr, h stayd a
night with us at Otrádno.”
“Oh, you know him?” said Prónskaya. “I can’t bar him. Il fait
à prsnt la plui t l bau tmps. * H’s too proud for anything.
Taks aftr his fathr. And h’s hand in glov with Spránski,
writing som projct or othr. Just look how h trats th ladis!
Thr’s on talking to him and h has turnd away,” sh said,
pointing at him. “I’d giv it to him if h tratd m as h dos
thos ladis.”
    * “H is all th rag just now.”
CHAPTR XVI
Suddnly vrybody stirrd, bgan talking, and prssd forward and thn
back, and btwn th two rows, which sparatd, th mpror ntrd to
th sounds of music that had immdiatly struck up. Bhind him walkd
his host and hostss. H walkd in rapidly, bowing to right and lft
as if anxious to gt th first momnts of th rcption ovr. Th band
playd th polonais in vogu at that tim on account of th words that
had bn st to it, bginning: “Alxandr, lisavta, all our harts
you ravish quit...” Th mpror passd on to th drawing room, th
crowd mad a rush for th doors, and svral prsons with xcitd facs
hurrid thr and back again. Thn th crowd hastily rtird from
th drawing room door, at which th mpror rappard talking to th
hostss. A young man, looking distraught, pouncd down on th ladis,
asking thm to mov asid. Som ladis, with facs btraying complt
forgtfulnss of all th ruls of dcorum, pushd forward to th
dtrimnt of thir toilts. Th mn bgan to choos partnrs and tak
thir placs for th polonais.
vryon movd back, and th mpror cam smiling out of th drawing
room lading his hostss by th hand but not kping tim to th
music. Th host followd with Márya Antónovna Narýshkina; thn
cam ambassadors, ministrs, and various gnrals, whom Prónskaya
diligntly namd. Mor than half th ladis alrady had partnrs
and wr taking up, or prparing to tak up, thir positions for th
polonais. Natásha flt that sh would b lft with hr mothr and
Sónya among a minority of womn who crowdd nar th wall, not having
bn invitd to danc. Sh stood with hr slndr arms hanging down,
hr scarcly dfind bosom rising and falling rgularly, and with
batd brath and glittring, frightnd ys gazd straight bfor
hr, vidntly prpard for th hight of joy or misry. Sh was
not concrnd about th mpror or any of thos grat popl whom
Prónskaya was pointing out—sh had but on thought: “Is it
possibl no on will ask m, that I shall not b among th first to
danc? Is it possibl that not on of all ths mn will notic m?
Thy do not vn sm to s m, or if thy do thy look as if thy
wr saying, ‘Ah, sh’s not th on I’m aftr, so it’s not worth
looking at hr!’ No, it’s impossibl,” sh thought. “Thy must
know how I long to danc, how splndidly I danc, and how thy would
njoy dancing with m.”
Th strains of th polonais, which had continud for a considrabl
tim, had bgun to sound lik a sad rminiscnc to Natásha’s ars.
Sh wantd to cry. Prónskaya had lft thm. Th count was at th
othr nd of th room. Sh and th countss and Sónya wr standing by
thmslvs as in th dpths of a forst amid that crowd of strangrs,
with no on intrstd in thm and not wantd by anyon. Princ Andrw
with a lady passd by, vidntly not rcognizing thm. Th handsom
Anatol was smilingly talking to a partnr on his arm and lookd at
Natásha as on looks at a wall. Borís passd thm twic and ach tim
turnd away. Brg and his wif, who wr not dancing, cam up to thm.
This family gathring smd humiliating to Natásha—as if thr wr
nowhr ls for th family to talk but hr at th ball. Sh did not
listn to or look at Vra, who was tlling hr somthing about hr own
grn drss.
At last th mpror stoppd bsid his last partnr (h had dancd
with thr) and th music casd. A worrid aid-d-camp ran up to th
Rostóvs rqusting thm to stand farthr back, though as it was thy
wr alrady clos to th wall, and from th gallry rsoundd th
distinct, prcis, nticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. Th mpror
lookd smilingly down th room. A minut passd but no on had yt bgun
dancing. An aid-d-camp, th Mastr of Crmonis, wnt up to Countss
Bzúkhova and askd hr to danc. Sh smilingly raisd hr hand and
laid it on his shouldr without looking at him. Th aid-d-camp, an
adpt in his art, grasping his partnr firmly round hr waist, with
confidnt dlibration startd smoothly, gliding first round th dg of
th circl, thn at th cornr of th room h caught Hlèn’s
lft hand and turnd hr, th only sound audibl, apart from th
vr-quickning music, bing th rhythmic click of th spurs on his
rapid, agil ft, whil at vry third bat his partnr’s vlvt
drss sprad out and smd to flash as sh whirld round. Natásha
gazd at thm and was rady to cry bcaus it was not sh who was
dancing that first turn of th waltz.
Princ Andrw, in th whit uniform of a cavalry colonl, waring
stockings and dancing shos, stood looking animatd and bright in th
front row of th circl not far from th Rostóvs. Baron Firhoff was
talking to him about th first sitting of th Council of Stat to b
hld nxt day. Princ Andrw, as on closly connctd with Spránski
and participating in th work of th lgislativ commission, could giv
rliabl information about that sitting, concrning which various rumors
wr currnt. But not listning to what Firhoff was saying, h was
gazing now at th sovrign and now at th mn intnding to danc who
had not yt gathrd courag to ntr th circl.
Princ Andrw was watching ths mn abashd by th mpror’s
prsnc, and th womn who wr brathlssly longing to b askd to
danc.
Pirr cam up to him and caught him by th arm.
“You always danc. I hav a protg, th young Rostóva, hr. Ask
hr,” h said.
“Whr is sh?” askd Bolkónski. “xcus m!” h addd, turning
to th baron, “w will finish this convrsation lswhr—at a ball
on must danc.” H stppd forward in th dirction Pirr indicatd.
Th dspairing, djctd xprssion of Natásha’s fac caught his y.
H rcognizd hr, gussd hr flings, saw that it was hr dbut,
rmmbrd hr convrsation at th window, and with an xprssion of
plasur on his fac approachd Countss Rostóva.
“Allow m to introduc you to my daughtr,” said th countss, with
hightnd color.
“I hav th plasur of bing alrady acquaintd, if th countss
rmmbrs m,” said Princ Andrw with a low and courtous bow quit
blying Prónskaya’s rmarks about his rudnss, and approaching
Natásha h hld out his arm to grasp hr waist bfor h had compltd
his invitation. H askd hr to waltz. That trmulous xprssion on
Natásha’s fac, prpard ithr for dspair or raptur, suddnly
brightnd into a happy, gratful, childlik smil.
“I hav long bn waiting for you,” that frightnd happy littl
girl smd to say by th smil that rplacd th thratnd tars, as
sh raisd hr hand to Princ Andrw’s shouldr. Thy wr th scond
coupl to ntr th circl. Princ Andrw was on of th bst dancrs of
his day and Natásha dancd xquisitly. Hr littl ft in thir whit
satin dancing shos did thir work swiftly, lightly, and indpndntly
of hrslf, whil hr fac bamd with cstatic happinss. Hr slndr
bar arms and nck wr not bautiful—compard to Hlèn’s hr
shouldrs lookd thin and hr bosom undvlopd. But Hlèn smd, as
it wr, hardnd by a varnish lft by th thousands of looks that had
scannd hr prson, whil Natásha was lik a girl xposd for th first
tim, who would hav flt vry much ashamd had sh not bn assurd
that this was absolutly ncssary.
Princ Andrw likd dancing, and wishing to scap as quickly as
possibl from th political and clvr talk which vryon addrssd
to him, wishing also to brak up th circl of rstraint h dislikd,
causd by th mpror’s prsnc, h dancd, and had chosn Natásha
bcaus Pirr pointd hr out to him and bcaus sh was th first
prtty girl who caught his y; but scarcly had h mbracd that
slndr suppl figur and flt hr stirring so clos to him and smiling
so nar him than th win of hr charm ros to his had, and h
flt himslf rvivd and rjuvnatd whn aftr laving hr h stood
brathing dply and watching th othr dancrs.
CHAPTR XVII
Aftr Princ Andrw, Borís cam up to ask Natásha for a danc, and
thn th aid-d-camp who had opnd th ball, and svral othr young
mn, so that, flushd and happy, and passing on hr suprfluous partnrs
to Sónya, sh did not cas dancing all th vning. Sh noticd and
saw nothing of what occupid vryon ls. Not only did sh fail to
notic that th mpror talkd a long tim with th Frnch ambassador,
and how particularly gracious h was to a crtain lady, or that Princ
So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that Hlèn
had grat succss and was honord by th spcial attntion of So-and-so,
but sh did not vn s th mpror, and only noticd that h had gon
bcaus th ball bcam livlir aftr his dpartur. For on of th
mrry cotillions bfor suppr Princ Andrw was again hr partnr. H
rmindd hr of thir first ncountr in th Otrádno avnu, and how
sh had bn unabl to slp that moonlight night, and told hr how h
had involuntarily ovrhard hr. Natásha blushd at that rcollction
and trid to xcus hrslf, as if thr had bn somthing to b
ashamd of in what Princ Andrw had ovrhard.
Lik all mn who hav grown up in socity, Princ Andrw likd mting
somon thr not of th convntional socity stamp. And such was
Natásha, with hr surpris, hr dlight, hr shynss, and vn hr
mistaks in spaking Frnch. With hr h bhavd with spcial car and
tndrnss, sitting bsid hr and talking of th simplst and most
unimportant mattrs; h admird hr shy grac. In th middl of th
cotillion, having compltd on of th figurs, Natásha, still out of
brath, was rturning to hr sat whn anothr dancr chos hr. Sh was
tird and panting and vidntly thought of dclining, but immdiatly
put hr hand gaily on th man’s shouldr, smiling at Princ Andrw.
“I’d b glad to sit bsid you and rst: I’m tird; but you s
how thy kp asking m, and I’m glad of it, I’m happy and I lov
vrybody, and you and I undrstand it all,” and much, much mor was
said in hr smil. Whn hr partnr lft hr Natásha ran across th
room to choos two ladis for th figur.
“If sh gos to hr cousin first and thn to anothr lady, sh will b
my wif,” said Princ Andrw to himslf quit to his own surpris, as
h watchd hr. Sh did go first to hr cousin.
“What rubbish somtims ntrs on’s had!” thought Princ Andrw,
“but what is crtain is that that girl is so charming, so original,
that sh won’t b dancing hr a month bfor sh will b marrid....
Such as sh ar rar hr,” h thought, as Natásha, radjusting a
ros that was slipping on hr bodic, sttld hrslf bsid him.
Whn th cotillion was ovr th old count in his blu coat cam up to
th dancrs. H invitd Princ Andrw to com and s thm, and askd
his daughtr whthr sh was njoying hrslf. Natásha did not answr
at onc but only lookd up with a smil that said rproachfully: “How
can you ask such a qustion?”
“I hav nvr njoyd myslf so much bfor!” sh said, and Princ
Andrw noticd how hr thin arms ros quickly as if to mbrac hr
fathr and instantly droppd again. Natásha was happir than sh had
vr bn in hr lif. Sh was at that hight of bliss whn on bcoms
compltly kind and good and dos not bliv in th possibility of
vil, unhappinss, or sorrow.
At that ball Pirr for th first tim flt humiliatd by th position
his wif occupid in court circls. H was gloomy and absnt-mindd. A
dp furrow ran across his forhad, and standing by a window h stard
ovr his spctacls sing no on.
On hr way to suppr Natásha passd him.
Pirr’s gloomy, unhappy look struck hr. Sh stoppd in front of him.
Sh wishd to hlp him, to bstow on him th suprabundanc of hr own
happinss.
“How dlightful it is, Count!” said sh. “Isn’t it?”
Pirr smild absnt-minddly, vidntly not grasping what sh said.
“Ys, I am vry glad,” h said.
“How can popl b dissatisfid with anything?” thought Natásha.
“spcially such a capital fllow as Bzúkhov!” In Natásha’s
ys all th popl at th ball alik wr good, kind, and splndid
popl, loving on anothr; non of thm capabl of injuring
anothr—and so thy ought all to b happy.
CHAPTR XVIII
Nxt day Princ Andrw thought of th ball, but his mind did not dwll
on it long. “Ys, it was a vry brilliant ball,” and thn... “Ys,
that littl Rostóva is vry charming. Thr’s somthing frsh,
original, un-Ptrsburg-lik about hr that distinguishs hr.” That
was all h thought about ystrday’s ball, and aftr his morning ta
h st to work.
But ithr from fatigu or want of slp h was ill-disposd for work
and could gt nothing don. H kpt criticizing his own work, as h
oftn did, and was glad whn h hard somon coming.
Th visitor was Bítski, who srvd on various committs, frquntd
all th socitis in Ptrsburg, and a passionat dvot of th nw
idas and of Spránski, and a dilignt Ptrsburg nwsmongr—on of
thos mn who choos thir opinions lik thir cloths according to
th fashion, but who for that vry rason appar to b th warmst
partisans. Hardly had h got rid of his hat bfor h ran into Princ
Andrw’s room with a proccupid air and at onc bgan talking. H
had just hard particulars of that morning’s sitting of th Council
of Stat opnd by th mpror, and h spok of it nthusiastically. Th
mpror’s spch had bn xtraordinary. It had bn a spch such as
only constitutional monarchs dlivr. “Th Sovrign plainly said
that th Council and Snat ar stats of th ralm, h said that th
govrnmnt must rst not on authority but on scur bass. Th mpror
said that th fiscal systm must b rorganizd and th accounts
publishd,” rcountd Bítski, mphasizing crtain words and opning
his ys significantly.
“Ah, ys! Today’s vnts mark an poch, th gratst poch in our
history,” h concludd.
Princ Andrw listnd to th account of th opning of th Council of
Stat, which h had so impatintly awaitd and to which h had attachd
such importanc, and was surprisd that this vnt, now that it had
takn plac, did not affct him, and vn smd quit insignificant. H
listnd with quit irony to Bítski’s nthusiastic account of it. A
vry simpl thought occurrd to him: “What dos it mattr to m or to
Bítski what th mpror was plasd to say at th Council? Can all that
mak m any happir or bttr?”
And this simpl rflction suddnly dstroyd all th intrst Princ
Andrw had flt in th impnding rforms. H was going to din that
vning at Spránski’s, “with only a fw frinds,” as th host
had said whn inviting him. Th prospct of that dinnr in th intimat
hom circl of th man h so admird had gratly intrstd Princ
Andrw, spcially as h had not yt sn Spránski in his domstic
surroundings, but now h flt disinclind to go to it.
At th appointd hour, howvr, h ntrd th modst hous Spránski
ownd in th Taurida Gardns. In th parqutd dining room this small
hous, rmarkabl for its xtrm clanlinss (suggsting that of a
monastry), Princ Andrw, who was rathr lat, found th frindly
gathring of Spránski’s intimat acquaintancs alrady assmbld
at fiv o’clock. Thr wr no ladis prsnt xcpt Spránski’s
littl daughtr (long-facd lik hr fathr) and hr govrnss. Th
othr gusts wr Grvais, Magnítski, and Stolýpin. Whil still in
th antroom Princ Andrw hard loud voics and a ringing staccato
laugh—a laugh such as on hars on th stag. Somon—it soundd
lik Spránski—was distinctly jaculating ha-ha-ha. Princ Andrw
had nvr bfor hard Spránski’s famous laugh, and this ringing,
high-pitchd laughtr from a statsman mad a strang imprssion on him.
H ntrd th dining room. Th whol company wr standing btwn two
windows at a small tabl laid with hors-d’ouvrs. Spránski, waring
a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on th brast, and vidntly still
th sam waistcoat and high whit stock h had worn at th mting of
th Council of Stat, stood at th tabl with a baming countnanc. His
gusts surroundd him. Magnítski, addrssing himslf to Spránski,
was rlating an ancdot, and Spránski was laughing in advanc at
what Magnítski was going to say. Whn Princ Andrw ntrd th room
Magnítski’s words wr again crownd by laughtr. Stolýpin gav
a dp bass guffaw as h munchd a pic of brad and chs. Grvais
laughd softly with a hissing chuckl, and Spránski in a high-pitchd
staccato mannr.
Still laughing, Spránski hld out his soft whit hand to Princ
Andrw.
“Vry plasd to s you, Princ,” h said. “On momnt...” h
wnt on, turning to Magnítski and intrrupting his story. “W hav
agrd that this is a dinnr for rcration, with not a word about
businss!” and turning again to th narrator h bgan to laugh afrsh.
Princ Andrw lookd at th laughing Spránski with astonishmnt,
rgrt, and disillusionmnt. It smd to him that this was not
Spránski but somon ls. vrything that had formrly appard
mystrious and fascinating in Spránski suddnly bcam plain and
unattractiv.
At dinnr th convrsation did not cas for a momnt and smd to
consist of th contnts of a book of funny ancdots. Bfor Magnítski
had finishd his story somon ls was anxious to rlat somthing
still funnir. Most of th ancdots, if not rlating to th stat
srvic, rlatd to popl in th srvic. It smd that in this
company th insignificanc of thos popl was so dfinitly accptd
that th only possibl attitud toward thm was on of good humord
ridicul. Spránski rlatd how at th Council that morning a daf
dignitary, whn askd his opinion, rplid that h thought so too.
Grvais gav a long account of an official rvision, rmarkabl for th
stupidity of vrybody concrnd. Stolýpin, stuttring, brok into
th convrsation and bgan xcitdly talking of th abuss that xistd
undr th formr ordr of things—thratning to giv a srious turn
to th convrsation. Magnítski starting quizzing Stolýpin about his
vhmnc. Grvais intrvnd with a jok, and th talk rvrtd to its
formr livly ton.
vidntly Spránski likd to rst aftr his labors and find amusmnt
in a circl of frinds, and his gusts, undrstanding his wish, trid
to nlivn him and amus thmslvs. But thir gaity smd to Princ
Andrw mirthlss and tirsom. Spránski’s high-pitchd voic struck
him unplasantly, and th incssant laughtr gratd on him lik a fals
not. Princ Andrw did not laugh and fard that h would b a dampr
on th spirits of th company, but no on took any notic of his bing
out of harmony with th gnral mood. Thy all smd vry gay.
H trid svral tims to join in th convrsation, but his rmarks wr
tossd asid ach tim lik a cork thrown out of th watr, and h could
not jst with thm.
Thr was nothing wrong or unsmly in what thy said, it was witty and
might hav bn funny, but it lackd just that somthing which is th
salt of mirth, and thy wr not vn awar that such a thing xistd.
Aftr dinnr Spránski’s daughtr and hr govrnss ros. H pattd
th littl girl with his whit hand and kissd hr. And that gstur,
too, smd unnatural to Princ Andrw.
Th mn rmaind at tabl ovr thir port—nglish fashion. In th
midst of a convrsation that was startd about Napolon’s Spanish
affairs, which thy all agrd in approving, Princ Andrw bgan to
xprss a contrary opinion. Spránski smild and, with an vidnt wish
to prvnt th convrsation from taking an unplasant cours, told a
story that had no connction with th prvious convrsation. For a fw
momnts all wr silnt.
Having sat som tim at tabl, Spránski corkd a bottl of win and,
rmarking, “Nowadays good win rids in a carriag and pair,” passd
it to th srvant and got up. All ros and continuing to talk loudly
wnt into th drawing room. Two lttrs brought by a courir wr handd
to Spránski and h took thm to his study. As soon as h had lft
th room th gnral mrrimnt stoppd and th gusts bgan to convrs
snsibly and quitly with on anothr.
“Now for th rcitation!” said Spránski on rturning from
his study. “A wondrful talnt!” h said to Princ Andrw, and
Magnítski immdiatly assumd a pos and bgan rciting som humorous
vrss in Frnch which h had composd about various wll-known
Ptrsburg popl. H was intrruptd svral tims by applaus. Whn
th vrss wr finishd Princ Andrw wnt up to Spránski and took
his lav.
“Whr ar you off to so arly?” askd Spránski.
“I promisd to go to a rcption.”
Thy said no mor. Princ Andrw lookd closly into thos mirrorlik,
impntrabl ys, and flt that it had bn ridiculous of him to hav
xpctd anything from Spránski and from any of his own activitis
connctd with him, or vr to hav attributd importanc to what
Spránski was doing. That prcis, mirthlss laughtr rang in Princ
Andrw’s ars long aftr h had lft th hous.
Whn h rachd hom Princ Andrw bgan thinking of his lif in
Ptrsburg during thos last four months as if it wr somthing nw. H
rcalld his xrtions and solicitations, and th history of his projct
of army rform, which had bn accptd for considration and which thy
wr trying to pass ovr in silnc simply bcaus anothr, a vry poor
on, had alrady bn prpard and submittd to th mpror. H thought
of th mtings of a committ of which Brg was a mmbr. H rmmbrd
how carfully and at what lngth vrything rlating to form and
procdur was discussd at thos mtings, and how sdulously and
promptly all that rlatd to th gist of th businss was vadd. H
rcalld his labors on th Lgal Cod, and how painstakingly h had
translatd th articls of th Roman and Frnch cods into Russian,
and h flt ashamd of himslf. Thn h vividly picturd to himslf
Boguchárovo, his occupations in th country, his journy to Ryazán;
h rmmbrd th pasants and Dron th villag ldr, and mntally
applying to thm th Prsonal Rights h had dividd into paragraphs, h
flt astonishd that h could hav spnt so much tim on such uslss
work.
CHAPTR XIX
Nxt day Princ Andrw calld at a fw houss h had not visitd bfor,
and among thm at th Rostóvs’ with whom h had rnwd acquaintanc
at th ball. Apart from considrations of politnss which dmandd th
call, h wantd to s that original, agr girl who had lft such a
plasant imprssion on his mind, in hr own hom.
Natásha was on of th first to mt him. Sh was waring a dark-blu
hous drss in which Princ Andrw thought hr vn prttir than in
hr ball drss. Sh and all th Rostóv family wlcomd him as an old
frind, simply and cordially. Th whol family, whom h had formrly
judgd svrly, now smd to him to consist of xcllnt, simpl,
and kindly popl. Th old count’s hospitality and good natur, which
struck on spcially in Ptrsburg as a plasant surpris, wr such
that Princ Andrw could not rfus to stay to dinnr. “Ys,”
h thought, “thy ar capital popl, who of cours hav not th
slightst ida what a trasur thy possss in Natásha; but thy ar
kindly folk and form th bst possibl stting for this strikingly
potic, charming girl, ovrflowing with lif!”
In Natásha Princ Andrw was conscious of a strang world compltly
alin to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a diffrnt world,
that in th Otrádno avnu and at th window that moonlight night
had alrady bgun to disconcrt him. Now this world disconcrtd him no
longr and was no longr alin to him, but h himslf having ntrd it
found in it a nw njoymnt.
Aftr dinnr Natásha, at Princ Andrw’s rqust, wnt to th
clavichord and bgan singing. Princ Andrw stood by a window talking
to th ladis and listnd to hr. In th midst of a phras h casd
spaking and suddnly flt tars choking him, a thing h had thought
impossibl for him. H lookd at Natásha as sh sang, and somthing nw
and joyful stirrd in his soul. H flt happy and at th sam tim sad.
H had absolutly nothing to wp about yt h was rady to wp. What
about? His formr lov? Th littl princss? His disillusionmnts?...
His hops for th futur?... Ys and no. Th chif rason was a suddn,
vivid sns of th trribl contrast btwn somthing infinitly grat
and illimitabl within him and that limitd and matrial somthing that
h, and vn sh, was. This contrast wighd on and yt chrd him
whil sh sang.
As soon as Natásha had finishd sh wnt up to him and askd how h
likd hr voic. Sh askd this and thn bcam confusd, fling that
sh ought not to hav askd it. H smild, looking at hr, and said h
likd hr singing as h likd vrything sh did.
Princ Andrw lft th Rostóvs’ lat in th vning. H wnt to bd
from habit, but soon ralizd that h could not slp. Having lit his
candl h sat up in bd, thn got up, thn lay down again not at all
troubld by his slplssnss: his soul was as frsh and joyful as if h
had stppd out of a stuffy room into God’s own frsh air. It did not
ntr his had that h was in lov with Natásha; h was not thinking
about hr, but only picturing hr to himslf, and in consqunc all
lif appard in a nw light. “Why do I striv, why do I toil in this
narrow, confind fram, whn lif, all lif with all its joys, is opn
to m?” said h to himslf. And for th first tim for a vry long
whil h bgan making happy plans for th futur. H dcidd that h
must attnd to his son’s ducation by finding a tutor and putting
th boy in his charg, thn h ought to rtir from th srvic and go
abroad, and s ngland, Switzrland and Italy. “I must us my frdom
whil I fl so much strngth and youth in m,” h said to himslf.
“Pirr was right whn h said on must bliv in th possibility of
happinss in ordr to b happy, and now I do bliv in it. Lt th dad
bury thir dad, but whil on has lif on must liv and b happy!”
thought h.
CHAPTR XX
On morning Colonl Brg, whom Pirr knw as h knw vrybody in
Moscow and Ptrsburg, cam to s him. Brg arrivd in an immaculat
brand-nw uniform, with his hair pomadd and brushd forward ovr his
tmpls as th mpror Alxandr wor his hair.
“I hav just bn to s th countss, your wif. Unfortunatly sh
could not grant my rqust, but I hop, Count, I shall b mor fortunat
with you,” h said with a smil.
“What is it you wish, Colonl? I am at your srvic.”
“I hav now quit sttld in my nw rooms, Count” (Brg said
this with prfct conviction that this information could not but b
agrabl), “and so I wish to arrang just a small party for my own
and my wif’s frinds.” (H smild still mor plasantly.) “I
wishd to ask th countss and you to do m th honor of coming to ta
and to suppr.”
Only Countss Hlèn, considring th socity of such popl as th
Brgs bnath hr, could b crul nough to rfus such an invitation.
Brg xplaind so clarly why h wantd to collct at his hous a small
but slct company, and why this would giv him plasur, and why though
h grudgd spnding mony on cards or anything harmful, h was prpard
to run into som xpns for th sak of good socity—that Pirr
could not rfus, and promisd to com.
“But don’t b lat, Count, if I may vntur to ask; about tn
minuts to ight, plas. W shall mak up a rubbr. Our gnral is
coming. H is vry good to m. W shall hav suppr, Count. So you will
do m th favor.”
Contrary to his habit of bing lat, Pirr on that day arrivd at th
Brgs’ hous, not at tn but at fiftn minuts to ight.
Having prpard vrything ncssary for th party, th Brgs wr rady
for thir gusts’ arrival.
In thir nw, clan, and light study with its small busts and picturs
and nw furnitur sat Brg and his wif. Brg, closly buttond up in
his nw uniform, sat bsid his wif xplaining to hr that on always
could and should b acquaintd with popl abov on, bcaus only thn
dos on gt satisfaction from acquaintancs.
“You can gt to know somthing, you can ask for somthing. S how I
managd from my first promotion.” (Brg masurd his lif not by yars
but by promotions.) “My comrads ar still nobodis, whil I am only
waiting for a vacancy to command a rgimnt, and hav th happinss to
b your husband.” (H ros and kissd Vra’s hand, and on th way
to hr straightnd out a turnd-up cornr of th carpt.) “And
how hav I obtaind all this? Chifly by knowing how to choos my
aquaintancs. It gos without saying that on must b conscintious and
mthodical.”
Brg smild with a sns of his supriority ovr a wak woman, and
pausd, rflcting that this dar wif of his was aftr all but a wak
woman who could not undrstand all that constituts a man’s dignity,
what it was in Mann zu sin. * Vra at th sam tim smiling with a
sns of supriority ovr hr good, conscintious husband, who all th
sam undrstood lif wrongly, as according to Vra all mn did. Brg,
judging by his wif, thought all womn wak and foolish. Vra, judging
only by hr husband and gnralizing from that obsrvation, supposd
that all mn, though thy undrstand nothing and ar concitd and
slfish, ascrib common sns to thmslvs alon.
    * To b a man.
Brg ros and mbracd his wif carfully, so as not to crush hr lac
fichu for which h had paid a good pric, kissing hr straight on th
lips.
“Th only thing is, w mustn’t hav childrn too soon,” h
continud, following an unconscious squnc of idas.
“Ys,” answrd Vra, “I don’t at all want that. W must liv
for socity.”
“Princss Yusúpova wor on xactly lik this,” said Brg, pointing
to th fichu with a happy and kindly smil.
Just thn Count Bzúkhov was announcd. Husband and wif glancd at on
anothr, both smiling with slf-satisfaction, and ach mntally claiming
th honor of this visit.
“This is what coms of knowing how to mak acquaintancs,” thought
Brg. “This is what coms of knowing how to conduct onslf.”
“But plas don’t intrrupt m whn I am ntrtaining th gusts,”
said Vra, “bcaus I know what intrsts ach of thm and what to
say to diffrnt popl.”
Brg smild again.
“It can’t b hlpd: mn must somtims hav masculin
convrsation,” said h.
Thy rcivd Pirr in thir small, nw drawing room, whr it was
impossibl to sit down anywhr without disturbing its symmtry,
natnss, and ordr; so it was quit comprhnsibl and not strang that
Brg, having gnrously offrd to disturb th symmtry of an armchair
or of th sofa for his dar gust, but bing apparntly painfully
undcidd on th mattr himslf, vntually lft th visitor to sttl
th qustion of slction. Pirr disturbd th symmtry by moving a
chair for himslf, and Brg and Vra immdiatly bgan thir vning
party, intrrupting ach othr in thir fforts to ntrtain thir
gust.
Vra, having dcidd in hr own mind that Pirr ought to b
ntrtaind with convrsation about th Frnch mbassy, at onc bgan
accordingly. Brg, having dcidd that masculin convrsation was
rquird, intrruptd his wif’s rmarks and touchd on th qustion
of th war with Austria, and unconsciously jumpd from th gnral
subjct to prsonal considrations as to th proposals mad him to tak
part in th Austrian campaign and th rasons why h had dclind thm.
Though th convrsation was vry incohrnt and Vra was angry at th
intrusion of th masculin lmnt, both husband and wif flt with
satisfaction that, vn if only on gust was prsnt, thir vning had
bgun vry wll and was as lik as two pas to vry othr vning party
with its talk, ta, and lightd candls.
Bfor long Borís, Brg’s old comrad, arrivd. Thr was a shad of
condscnsion and patronag in his tratmnt of Brg and Vra. Aftr
Borís cam a lady with th colonl, thn th gnral himslf, thn th
Rostóvs, and th party bcam unqustionably xactly lik all othr
vning partis. Brg and Vra could not rprss thir smils of
satisfaction at th sight of all this movmnt in thir drawing room,
at th sound of th disconnctd talk, th rustling of drsss, and th
bowing and scraping. vrything was just as vrybody always has it,
spcially so th gnral, who admird th apartmnt, pattd Brg on th
shouldr, and with parntal authority suprintndd th stting out of
th tabl for boston. Th gnral sat down by Count Ilyá Rostóv, who
was nxt to himslf th most important gust. Th old popl sat with
th old, th young with th young, and th hostss at th ta tabl, on
which stood xactly th sam kind of caks in a silvr cak baskt as
th Panins had at thir party. vrything was just as it was vrywhr
ls.
CHAPTR XXI
Pirr, as on of th principal gusts, had to sit down to boston
with Count Rostóv, th gnral, and th colonl. At th card tabl h
happnd to b dirctly facing Natásha, and was struck by a curious
chang that had com ovr hr sinc th ball. Sh was silnt, and not
only lss prtty than at th ball, but only rdmd from plainnss by
hr look of gntl indiffrnc to vrything around.
“What’s th mattr with hr?” thought Pirr, glancing at hr.
Sh was sitting by hr sistr at th ta tabl, and rluctantly, without
looking at him, mad som rply to Borís who sat down bsid hr. Aftr
playing out a whol suit and to his partnr’s dlight taking fiv
tricks, Pirr, haring grtings and th stps of somon who had
ntrd th room whil h was picking up his tricks, glancd again at
Natásha.
“What has happnd to hr?” h askd himslf with still gratr
surpris.
Princ Andrw was standing bfor hr, saying somthing to hr with a
look of tndr solicitud. Sh, having raisd hr had, was looking up
at him, flushd and vidntly trying to mastr hr rapid brathing. And
th bright glow of som innr fir that had bn supprssd was again
alight in hr. Sh was compltly transformd and from a plain girl had
again bcom what sh had bn at th ball.
Princ Andrw wnt up to Pirr, and th lattr noticd a nw and
youthful xprssion in his frind’s fac.
Pirr changd placs svral tims during th gam, sitting now with
his back to Natásha and now facing hr, but during th whol of th six
rubbrs h watchd hr and his frind.
“Somthing vry important is happning btwn thm,” thought
Pirr, and a fling that was both joyful and painful agitatd him and
mad him nglct th gam.
Aftr six rubbrs th gnral got up, saying that it was no us playing
lik that, and Pirr was rlasd. Natásha on on sid was talking
with Sónya and Borís, and Vra with a subtl smil was saying
somthing to Princ Andrw. Pirr wnt up to his frind and, asking
whthr thy wr talking scrts, sat down bsid thm. Vra, having
noticd Princ Andrw’s attntions to Natásha, dcidd that at a
party, a ral vning party, subtl allusions to th tndr passion wr
absolutly ncssary and, sizing a momnt whn Princ Andrw was alon,
bgan a convrsation with him about flings in gnral and about hr
sistr. With so intllctual a gust as sh considrd Princ Andrw to
b, sh flt that sh had to mploy hr diplomatic tact.
Whn Pirr wnt up to thm h noticd that Vra was bing carrid away
by hr slf-satisfid talk, but that Princ Andrw smd mbarrassd, a
thing that rarly happnd with him.
“What do you think?” Vra was saying with an arch smil. “You ar
so discrning, Princ, and undrstand popl’s charactrs so wll at
a glanc. What do you think of Natali? Could sh b constant in hr
attachmnts? Could sh, lik othr womn” (Vra mant hrslf),
“lov a man onc for all and rmain tru to him forvr? That is what
I considr tru lov. What do you think, Princ?”
“I know your sistr too littl,” rplid Princ Andrw, with a
sarcastic smil undr which h wishd to hid his mbarrassmnt, “to
b abl to solv so dlicat a qustion, and thn I hav noticd that
th lss attractiv a woman is th mor constant sh is likly to b,”
h addd, and lookd up at Pirr who was just approaching thm.
“Ys, that is tru, Princ. In our days,” continud
Vra—mntioning “our days” as popl of limitd intllignc ar
fond of doing, imagining that thy hav discovrd and appraisd th
pculiaritis of “our days” and that human charactristics chang
with th tims—“in our days a girl has so much frdom that th
plasur of bing courtd oftn stifls ral fling in hr. And it must
b confssd that Natali is vry suscptibl.” This rturn to
th subjct of Natali causd Princ Andrw to knit his brows with
discomfort: h was about to ris, but Vra continud with a still mor
subtl smil:
“I think no on has bn mor courtd than sh,” sh wnt on, “but
till quit latly sh nvr card sriously for anyon. Now you know,
Count,” sh said to Pirr, “vn our dar cousin Borís, who,
btwn ourslvs, was vry far gon in th land of tndrnss...”
(alluding to a map of lov much in vogu at that tim).
Princ Andrw frownd and rmaind silnt.
“You ar frindly with Borís, arn’t you?” askd Vra.
“Ys, I know him....”
“I xpct h has told you of his childish lov for Natásha?”
“Oh, thr was childish lov?” suddnly askd Princ Andrw,
blushing unxpctdly.
“Ys, you know btwn cousins intimacy oftn lads to lov. L
cousinag st un dangrux voisinag. * Don’t you think so?”
    * “Cousinhood is a dangrous nighborhood.”
“Oh, undoubtdly!” said Princ Andrw, and with suddn and unnatural
livlinss h bgan chaffing Pirr about th nd to b vry carful
with his fifty-yar-old Moscow cousins, and in th midst of ths
jsting rmarks h ros, taking Pirr by th arm, and drw him asid.
“Wll?” askd Pirr, sing his frind’s strang animation with
surpris, and noticing th glanc h turnd on Natásha as h ros.
“I must... I must hav a talk with you,” said Princ Andrw. “You
know that pair of womn’s glovs?” (H rfrrd to th Masonic
glovs givn to a nwly initiatd Brothr to prsnt to th woman h
lovd.) “I... but no, I will talk to you latr on,” and with a
strang light in his ys and rstlssnss in his movmnts, Princ
Andrw approachd Natásha and sat down bsid hr. Pirr saw how
Princ Andrw askd hr somthing and how sh flushd as sh rplid.
But at that momnt Brg cam to Pirr and bgan insisting that h
should tak part in an argumnt btwn th gnral and th colonl on
th affairs in Spain.
Brg was satisfid and happy. Th smil of plasur nvr lft his fac.
Th party was vry succssful and quit lik othr partis h had
sn. vrything was similar: th ladis’ subtl talk, th cards, th
gnral raising his voic at th card tabl, and th samovar and th ta
caks; only on thing was lacking that h had always sn at th vning
partis h wishd to imitat. Thy had not yt had a loud convrsation
among th mn and a disput about somthing important and clvr. Now
th gnral had bgun such a discussion and so Brg drw Pirr to it.
CHAPTR XXII
Nxt day, having bn invitd by th count, Princ Andrw dind with th
Rostóvs and spnt th rst of th day thr.
vryon in th hous ralizd for whos sak Princ Andrw cam, and
without concaling it h trid to b with Natásha all day. Not only in
th soul of th frightnd yt happy and nrapturd Natásha, but in th
whol hous, thr was a fling of aw at somthing important that was
bound to happn. Th countss lookd with sad and strnly srious ys
at Princ Andrw whn h talkd to Natásha and timidly startd som
artificial convrsation about trifls as soon as h lookd hr way.
Sónya was afraid to lav Natásha and afraid of bing in th way whn
sh was with thm. Natásha grw pal, in a panic of xpctation, whn
sh rmaind alon with him for a momnt. Princ Andrw surprisd hr by
his timidity. Sh flt that h wantd to say somthing to hr but could
not bring himslf to do so.
In th vning, whn Princ Andrw had lft, th countss wnt up to
Natásha and whisprd: “Wll, what?”
“Mamma! For havn’s sak don’t ask m anything now! On can’t
talk about that,” said Natásha.
But all th sam that night Natásha, now agitatd and now frightnd,
lay a long tim in hr mothr’s bd gazing straight bfor hr. Sh
told hr how h had complimntd hr, how h told hr h was going
abroad, askd hr whr thy wr going to spnd th summr, and thn
how h had askd hr about Borís.
“But such a... such a... nvr happnd to m bfor!” sh said.
“Only I fl afraid in his prsnc. I am always afraid whn I’m
with him. What dos that man? Dos it man that it’s th ral thing?
Ys? Mamma, ar you aslp?”
“No, my lov; I am frightnd myslf,” answrd hr mothr. “Now
go!”
“All th sam I shan’t slp. What sillinss, to slp! Mummy!
Mummy! such a thing nvr happnd to m bfor,” sh said, surprisd
and alarmd at th fling sh was awar of in hrslf. “And could w
vr hav thought!...”
It smd to Natásha that vn at th tim sh first saw Princ Andrw
at Otrádno sh had falln in lov with him. It was as if sh fard
this strang, unxpctd happinss of mting again th vry man sh had
thn chosn (sh was firmly convincd sh had don so) and of finding
him, as it smd, not indiffrnt to hr.
“And it had to happn that h should com spcially to Ptrsburg
whil w ar hr. And it had to happn that w should mt at that
ball. It is fat. Clarly it is fat that vrything ld up to this!
Alrady thn, dirctly I saw him I flt somthing pculiar.”
“What ls did h say to you? What ar thos vrss? Rad thm...”
said hr mothr, thoughtfully, rfrring to som vrss Princ Andrw
had writtn in Natásha’s album.
“Mamma, on nd not b ashamd of his bing a widowr?”
“Don’t, Natásha! Pray to God. ‘Marriags ar mad in
havn,’” said hr mothr.
“Darling Mummy, how I lov you! How happy I am!” crid Natásha,
shdding tars of joy and xcitmnt and mbracing hr mothr.
At that vry tim Princ Andrw was sitting with Pirr and tlling him
of his lov for Natásha and his firm rsolv to mak hr his wif.
That day Countss Hlèn had a rcption at hr hous. Th Frnch
ambassador was thr, and a forign princ of th blood who had of
lat bcom a frqunt visitor of hrs, and many brilliant ladis and
gntlmn. Pirr, who had com downstairs, walkd through th rooms and
struck vryon by his proccupid, absnt-mindd, and moros air.
Sinc th ball h had flt th approach of a fit of nrvous dprssion
and had mad dsprat fforts to combat it. Sinc th intimacy of
his wif with th royal princ, Pirr had unxpctdly bn mad a
gntlman of th bdchambr, and from that tim h had bgun to fl
opprssd and ashamd in court socity, and dark thoughts of th vanity
of all things human cam to him oftnr than bfor. At th sam tim
th fling h had noticd btwn his protg Natásha and Princ
Andrw accntuatd his gloom by th contrast btwn his own position
and his frind’s. H trid qually to avoid thinking about his wif,
and about Natásha and Princ Andrw; and again vrything smd to him
insignificant in comparison with trnity; again th qustion: for what?
prsntd itslf; and h forcd himslf to work day and night at Masonic
labors, hoping to driv away th vil spirit that thratnd him. Toward
midnight, aftr h had lft th countss’ apartmnts, h was sitting
upstairs in a shabby drssing gown, copying out th original transaction
of th Scottish lodg of Frmasons at a tabl in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smok, whn somon cam in. It was Princ Andrw.
“Ah, it’s you!” said Pirr with a proccupid, dissatisfid air.
“And I, you s, am hard at it.” H pointd to his manuscript book
with that air of scaping from th ills of lif with which unhappy
popl look at thir work.
Princ Andrw, with a baming, cstatic xprssion of rnwd lif on
his fac, pausd in front of Pirr and, not noticing his sad look,
smild at him with th gotism of joy.
“Wll, dar hart,” said h, “I wantd to tll you about it
ystrday and I hav com to do so today. I nvr xprincd anything
lik it bfor. I am in lov, my frind!”
Suddnly Pirr havd a dp sigh and dumpd his havy prson down on
th sofa bsid Princ Andrw.
“With Natásha Rostóva, ys?” said h.
“Ys, ys! Who ls should it b? I should nvr hav blivd it,
but th fling is strongr than I. Ystrday I tormntd myslf and
suffrd, but I would not xchang vn that tormnt for anything in
th world, I hav not livd till now. At last I liv, but I can’t
liv without hr! But can sh lov m?... I am too old for hr.... Why
don’t you spak?”
“I? I? What did I tll you?” said Pirr suddnly, rising and
bginning to pac up and down th room. “I always thought it.... That
girl is such a trasur... sh is a rar girl.... My dar frind,
I ntrat you, don’t philosophiz, don’t doubt, marry, marry,
marry.... And I am sur thr will not b a happir man than you.”
“But what of hr?”
“Sh lovs you.”
“Don’t talk rubbish...” said Princ Andrw, smiling and looking
into Pirr’s ys.
“Sh dos, I know,” Pirr crid fircly.
“But do listn,” rturnd Princ Andrw, holding him by th
arm. “Do you know th condition I am in? I must talk about it to
somon.”
“Wll, go on, go on. I am vry glad,” said Pirr, and his fac
rally changd, his brow bcam smooth, and h listnd gladly to Princ
Andrw. Princ Andrw smd, and rally was, quit a diffrnt, quit
a nw man. Whr was his spln, his contmpt for lif, his
disillusionmnt? Pirr was th only prson to whom h mad up his mind
to spak opnly; and to him h told all that was in his soul. Now h
boldly and lightly mad plans for an xtndd futur, said h could not
sacrific his own happinss to his fathr’s capric, and spok of how
h would ithr mak his fathr consnt to this marriag and lov hr,
or would do without his consnt; thn h marvld at th fling that
had mastrd him as at somthing strang, apart from and indpndnt of
himslf.
“I should not hav blivd anyon who told m that I was capabl of
such lov,” said Princ Andrw. “It is not at all th sam fling
that I knw in th past. Th whol world is now for m dividd into two
halvs: on half is sh, and thr all is joy, hop, light: th
othr half is vrything whr sh is not, and thr is all gloom and
darknss....”
“Darknss and gloom,” ritratd Pirr: “ys, ys, I undrstand
that.”
“I cannot hlp loving th light, it is not my fault. And I am vry
happy! You undrstand m? I know you ar glad for my sak.”
“Ys, ys,” Pirr assntd, looking at his frind with a touchd
and sad xprssion in his ys. Th brightr Princ Andrw’s lot
appard to him, th gloomir smd his own.
CHAPTR XXIII
Princ Andrw ndd his fathr’s consnt to his marriag, and to
obtain this h startd for th country nxt day.
His fathr rcivd his son’s communication with xtrnal composur,
but inward wrath. H could not comprhnd how anyon could wish to
altr his lif or introduc anything nw into it, whn his own lif
was alrady nding. “If only thy would lt m nd my days as I want
to,” thought th old man, “thn thy might do as thy plas.”
With his son, howvr, h mployd th diplomacy h rsrvd for
important occasions and, adopting a quit ton, discussd th whol
mattr.
In th first plac th marriag was not a brilliant on as rgards
birth, walth, or rank. Scondly, Princ Andrw was no longr as young
as h had bn and his halth was poor (th old man laid spcial strss
on this), whil sh was vry young. Thirdly, h had a son whom it would
b a pity to ntrust to a chit of a girl. “Fourthly and finally,”
th fathr said, looking ironically at his son, “I bg you to put it
off for a yar: go abroad, tak a cur, look out as you wantd to for
a Grman tutor for Princ Nicholas. Thn if your lov or passion or
obstinacy—as you plas—is still as grat, marry! And that’s my
last word on it. Mind, th last...” concludd th princ, in a ton
which showd that nothing would mak him altr his dcision.
Princ Andrw saw clarly that th old man hopd that his flings, or
his fianc’s, would not stand a yar’s tst, or that h (th old
princ himslf) would di bfor thn, and h dcidd to conform to his
fathr’s wish—to propos, and postpon th wdding for a yar.
Thr wks aftr th last vning h had spnt with th Rostóvs,
Princ Andrw rturnd to Ptrsburg.
Nxt day aftr hr talk with hr mothr Natásha xpctd Bolkónski all
day, but h did not com. On th scond and third day it was th sam.
Pirr did not com ithr and Natásha, not knowing that Princ Andrw
had gon to s his fathr, could not xplain his absnc to hrslf.
Thr wks passd in this way. Natásha had no dsir to go out
anywhr and wandrd from room to room lik a shadow, idl and
listlss; sh wpt scrtly at night and did not go to hr mothr in th
vnings. Sh blushd continually and was irritabl. It smd to hr
that vrybody knw about hr disappointmnt and was laughing at hr and
pitying hr. Strong as was hr inward grif, this wound to hr vanity
intnsifid hr misry.
Onc sh cam to hr mothr, trid to say somthing, and suddnly bgan
to cry. Hr tars wr thos of an offndd child who dos not know why
it is bing punishd.
Th countss bgan to sooth Natásha, who aftr first listning to hr
mothr’s words, suddnly intrruptd hr:
“Lav off, Mamma! I don’t think, and don’t want to think about
it! H just cam and thn lft off, lft off....”
Hr voic trmbld, and sh again narly crid, but rcovrd and wnt
on quitly:
“And I don’t at all want to gt marrid. And I am afraid of him; I
hav now bcom quit calm, quit calm.”
Th day aftr this convrsation Natásha put on th old drss which
sh knw had th pculiar proprty of conducing to chrfulnss in th
mornings, and that day sh rturnd to th old way of lif which sh had
abandond sinc th ball. Having finishd hr morning ta sh wnt to
th ballroom, which sh particularly likd for its loud rsonanc, and
bgan singing hr solfggio. Whn sh had finishd hr first xrcis
sh stood still in th middl of th room and sang a musical phras that
particularly plasd hr. Sh listnd joyfully (as though sh had not
xpctd it) to th charm of th nots rvrbrating, filling th
whol mpty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at onc sh flt
chrful. “What’s th good of making so much of it? Things ar nic
as it is,” sh said to hrslf, and sh bgan walking up and down th
room, not stpping simply on th rsounding parqut but trading with
ach stp from th hl to th to (sh had on a nw and favorit pair
of shos) and listning to th rgular tap of th hl and crak of
th to as gladly as sh had to th sounds of hr own voic. Passing a
mirror sh glancd into it. “Thr, that’s m!” th xprssion of
hr fac smd to say as sh caught sight of hrslf. “Wll, and vry
nic too! I nd nobody.”
A footman wantd to com in to clar away somthing in th room but sh
would not lt him, and having closd th door bhind him continud hr
walk. That morning sh had rturnd to hr favorit mood—lov of,
and dlight in, hrslf. “How charming that Natásha is!” sh said
again, spaking as som third, collctiv, mal prson. “Prtty,
a good voic, young, and in nobody’s way if only thy lav hr in
pac.” But howvr much thy lft hr in pac sh could not now b
at pac, and immdiatly flt this.
In th hall th porch door opnd, and somon askd, “At hom?” and
thn footstps wr hard. Natásha was looking at th mirror, but did
not s hrslf. Sh listnd to th sounds in th hall. Whn sh saw
hrslf, hr fac was pal. It was h. Sh knw this for crtain, though
sh hardly hard his voic through th closd doors.
Pal and agitatd, Natásha ran into th drawing room.
“Mamma! Bolkónski has com!” sh said. “Mamma, it is awful, it is
unbarabl! I don’t want... to b tormntd? What am I to do?...”
Bfor th countss could answr, Princ Andrw ntrd th room with
an agitatd and srious fac. As soon as h saw Natásha his fac
brightnd. H kissd th countss’ hand and Natásha’s, and sat
down bsid th sofa.
“It is long sinc w had th plasur...” bgan th countss,
but Princ Andrw intrruptd hr by answring hr intndd qustion,
obviously in hast to say what h had to.
“I hav not bn to s you all this tim bcaus I hav bn at my
fathr’s. I had to talk ovr a vry important mattr with him. I only
got back last night,” h said glancing at Natásha; “I want to hav
a talk with you, Countss,” h addd aftr a momnt’s paus.
Th countss lowrd hr ys, sighing dply.
“I am at your disposal,” sh murmurd.
Natásha knw that sh ought to go away, but was unabl to do so:
somthing grippd hr throat, and rgardlss of mannrs sh stard
straight at Princ Andrw with wid-opn ys.
“At onc? This instant!... No, it can’t b!” sh thought.
Again h glancd at hr, and that glanc convincd hr that sh was not
mistakn. Ys, at onc, that vry instant, hr fat would b dcidd.
“Go, Natásha! I will call you,” said th countss in a whispr.
Natásha glancd with frightnd imploring ys at Princ Andrw and at
hr mothr and wnt out.
“I hav com, Countss, to ask for your daughtr’s hand,” said
Princ Andrw.
Th countss’ fac flushd hotly, but sh said nothing.
“Your offr...” sh bgan at last sdatly. H rmaind silnt,
looking into hr ys. “Your offr...” (sh grw confusd) “is
agrabl to us, and I accpt your offr. I am glad. And my husband... I
hop... but it will dpnd on hr....”
“I will spak to hr whn I hav your consnt.... Do you giv it to
m?” said Princ Andrw.
“Ys,” rplid th countss. Sh hld out hr hand to him, and with
a mixd fling of strangmnt and tndrnss prssd hr lips to his
forhad as h stoopd to kiss hr hand. Sh wishd to lov him as a
son, but flt that to hr h was a strangr and a trrifying man. “I
am sur my husband will consnt,” said th countss, “but your
fathr...”
“My fathr, to whom I hav told my plans, has mad it an xprss
condition of his consnt that th wdding is not to tak plac for a
yar. And I wishd to tll you of that,” said Princ Andrw.
“It is tru that Natásha is still young, but—so long as that?...”
“It is unavoidabl,” said Princ Andrw with a sigh.
“I will snd hr to you,” said th countss, and lft th room.
“Lord hav mrcy upon us!” sh rpatd whil sking hr daughtr.
Sónya said that Natásha was in hr bdroom. Natásha was sitting on
th bd, pal and dry-yd, and was gazing at th icons and whispring
somthing as sh rapidly crossd hrslf. Sing hr mothr sh jumpd
up and flw to hr.
“Wll, Mamma?... Wll?...”
“Go, go to him. H is asking for your hand,” said th countss,
coldly it smd to Natásha. “Go... go,” said th mothr, sadly and
rproachfully, with a dp sigh, as hr daughtr ran away.
Natásha nvr rmmbrd how sh ntrd th drawing room. Whn sh
cam in and saw him sh pausd. “Is it possibl that this strangr
has now bcom vrything to m?” sh askd hrslf, and immdiatly
answrd, “Ys, vrything! H alon is now darr to m than
vrything in th world.” Princ Andrw cam up to hr with downcast
ys.
“I hav lovd you from th vry first momnt I saw you. May I hop?”
H lookd at hr and was struck by th srious impassiond xprssion of
hr fac. Hr fac said: “Why ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know?
Why spak, whn words cannot xprss what on fls?”
Sh drw nar to him and stoppd. H took hr hand and kissd it.
“Do you lov m?”
“Ys, ys!” Natásha murmurd as if in vxation. Thn sh sighd
loudly and, catching hr brath mor and mor quickly, bgan to sob.
“What is it? What’s th mattr?”
“Oh, I am so happy!” sh rplid, smild through hr tars, bnt
ovr closr to him, pausd for an instant as if asking hrslf whthr
sh might, and thn kissd him.
Princ Andrw hld hr hands, lookd into hr ys, and did not find
in his hart his formr lov for hr. Somthing in him had suddnly
changd; thr was no longr th formr potic and mystic charm of
dsir, but thr was pity for hr fminin and childish waknss, far
at hr dvotion and trustfulnss, and an opprssiv yt joyful sns of
th duty that now bound him to hr forvr. Th prsnt fling, though
not so bright and potic as th formr, was strongr and mor srious.
“Did your mothr tll you that it cannot b for a yar?” askd
Princ Andrw, still looking into hr ys.
“Is it possibl that I—th ‘chit of a girl,’ as vrybody calld
m,” thought Natásha—“is it possibl that I am now to b th
wif and th qual of this strang, dar, clvr man whom vn my fathr
looks up to? Can it b tru? Can it b tru that thr can b no
mor playing with lif, that now I am grown up, that on m now lis
a rsponsibility for my vry word and dd? Ys, but what did h ask
m?”
“No,” sh rplid, but sh had not undrstood his qustion.
“Forgiv m!” h said. “But you ar so young, and I hav alrady
bn through so much in lif. I am afraid for you, you do not yt know
yourslf.”
Natásha listnd with concntratd attntion, trying but failing to
tak in th maning of his words.
“Hard as this yar which dlays my happinss will b,” continud
Princ Andrw, “it will giv you tim to b sur of yourslf. I ask
you to mak m happy in a yar, but you ar fr: our ngagmnt shall
rmain a scrt, and should you find that you do not lov m, or should
you com to lov...” said Princ Andrw with an unnatural smil.
“Why do you say that?” Natásha intrruptd him. “You know that
from th vry day you first cam to Otrádno I hav lovd you,” sh
crid, quit convincd that sh spok th truth.
“In a yar you will larn to know yourslf....”
“A whol yar!” Natásha rpatd suddnly, only now ralizing that
th marriag was to b postpond for a yar. “But why a yar? Why a
yar?...”
Princ Andrw bgan to xplain to hr th rasons for this dlay.
Natásha did not har him.
“And can’t it b hlpd?” sh askd. Princ Andrw did not rply,
but his fac xprssd th impossibility of altring that dcision.
“It’s awful! Oh, it’s awful! awful!” Natásha suddnly crid,
and again burst into sobs. “I shall di, waiting a yar: it’s
impossibl, it’s awful!” Sh lookd into hr lovr’s fac and saw
in it a look of commisration and prplxity.
“No, no! I’ll do anything!” sh said, suddnly chcking hr tars.
“I am so happy.”
Th fathr and mothr cam into th room and gav th btrothd coupl
thir blssing.
From that day Princ Andrw bgan to frqunt th Rostóvs’ as
Natásha’s affiancd lovr.
CHAPTR XXIV
No btrothal crmony took plac and Natásha’s ngagmnt to
Bolkónski was not announcd; Princ Andrw insistd on that. H said
that as h was rsponsibl for th dlay h ought to bar th whol
burdn of it; that h had givn his word and bound himslf forvr, but
that h did not wish to bind Natásha and gav hr prfct frdom. If
aftr six months sh flt that sh did not lov him sh would hav full
right to rjct him. Naturally nithr Natásha nor hr parnts wishd
to har of this, but Princ Andrw was firm. H cam vry day to th
Rostóvs’, but did not bhav to Natásha as an affiancd lovr: h
did not us th familiar thou, but said you to hr, and kissd only hr
hand. Aftr thir ngagmnt, quit diffrnt, intimat, and natural
rlations sprang up btwn thm. It was as if thy had not known ach
othr till now. Both likd to rcall how thy had rgardd ach othr
whn as yt thy wr nothing to on anothr; thy flt thmslvs
now quit diffrnt bings: thn thy wr artificial, now natural and
sincr. At first th family flt som constraint in intrcours with
Princ Andrw; h smd a man from anothr world, and for a long tim
Natásha traind th family to gt usd to him, proudly assuring thm
all that h only appard to b diffrnt, but was rally just lik all
of thm, and that sh was not afraid of him and no on ls ought to b.
Aftr a fw days thy grw accustomd to him, and without rstraint in
his prsnc pursud thir usual way of lif, in which h took his part.
H could talk about rural conomy with th count, fashions with th
countss and Natásha, and about albums and fancywork with Sónya.
Somtims th houshold both among thmslvs and in his prsnc
xprssd thir wondr at how it had all happnd, and at th vidnt
omns thr had bn of it: Princ Andrw’s coming to Otrádno and
thir coming to Ptrsburg, and th liknss btwn Natásha and Princ
Andrw which hr nurs had noticd on his first visit, and Andrw’s
ncountr with Nicholas in 1805, and many othr incidnts btokning
that it had to b.
In th hous that potic dullnss and quit rignd which always
accompanis th prsnc of a btrothd coupl. Oftn whn all sitting
togthr vryon kpt silnt. Somtims th othrs would gt up and
go away and th coupl, lft alon, still rmaind silnt. Thy rarly
spok of thir futur lif. Princ Andrw was afraid and ashamd to
spak of it. Natásha shard this as sh did all his flings, which sh
constantly divind. Onc sh bgan qustioning him about his son. Princ
Andrw blushd, as h oftn did now—Natásha particularly likd it in
him—and said that his son would not liv with thm.
“Why not?” askd Natásha in a frightnd ton.
“I cannot tak him away from his grandfathr, and bsids...”
“How I should hav lovd him!” said Natásha, immdiatly gussing
his thought; “but I know you wish to avoid any prtxt for finding
fault with us.”
Somtims th old count would com up, kiss Princ Andrw, and ask
his advic about Ptya’s ducation or Nicholas’ srvic. Th
old countss sighd as sh lookd at thm; Sónya was always gtting
frightnd lst sh should b in th way and trid to find xcuss for
laving thm alon, vn whn thy did not wish it. Whn Princ Andrw
spok (h could tll a story vry wll), Natásha listnd to him
with prid; whn sh spok sh noticd with far and joy that h gazd
attntivly and scrutinizingly at hr. Sh askd hrslf in prplxity:
“What dos h look for in m? H is trying to discovr somthing by
looking at m! What if what h sks in m is not thr?” Somtims
sh fll into on of th mad, mrry moods charactristic of hr, and
thn sh particularly lovd to har and s how Princ Andrw laughd.
H sldom laughd, but whn h did h abandond himslf ntirly to his
laughtr, and aftr such a laugh sh always flt narr to him. Natásha
would hav bn compltly happy if th thought of th sparation
awaiting hr and drawing nar had not trrifid hr, just as th mr
thought of it mad him turn pal and cold.
On th v of his dpartur from Ptrsburg Princ Andrw brought with
him Pirr, who had not bn to th Rostóvs’ onc sinc th ball.
Pirr smd disconcrtd and mbarrassd. H was talking to th
countss, and Natásha sat down bsid a littl chss tabl with Sónya,
thrby inviting Princ Andrw to com too. H did so.
“You hav known Bzúkhov a long tim?” h askd. “Do you lik
him?”
“Ys, h’s a dar, but vry absurd.”
And as usual whn spaking of Pirr, sh bgan to tll ancdots of his
absnt-minddnss, som of which had vn bn invntd about him.
“Do you know I hav ntrustd him with our scrt? I hav known him
from childhood. H has a hart of gold. I bg you, Natali,” Princ
Andrw said with suddn sriousnss—“I am going away and havn
knows what may happn. You may cas to... all right, I know I am not
to say that. Only this, thn: whatvr may happn to you whn I am not
hr...”
“What can happn?”
“Whatvr troubl may com,” Princ Andrw continud, “I bg
you, Madmoisll Sophi, whatvr may happn, to turn to him alon for
advic and hlp! H is a most absnt-mindd and absurd fllow, but h
has a hart of gold.”
Nithr hr fathr, nor hr mothr, nor Sónya, nor Princ Andrw
himslf could hav forsn how th sparation from hr lovr would act
on Natásha. Flushd and agitatd sh wnt about th hous all that day,
dry-yd, occupid with most trivial mattrs as if not undrstanding
what awaitd hr. Sh did not vn cry whn, on taking lav, h kissd
hr hand for th last tim. “Don’t go!” sh said in a ton
that mad him wondr whthr h rally ought not to stay and which h
rmmbrd long aftrwards. Nor did sh cry whn h was gon; but
for svral days sh sat in hr room dry-yd, taking no intrst in
anything and only saying now and thn, “Oh, why did h go away?”
But a fortnight aftr his dpartur, to th surpris of thos around
hr, sh rcovrd from hr mntal sicknss just as suddnly and bcam
hr old slf again, but with a chang in hr moral physiognomy, as a
child gts up aftr a long illnss with a changd xprssion of fac.
CHAPTR XXV
During that yar aftr his son’s dpartur, Princ Nicholas
Bolkónski’s halth and tmpr bcam much wors. H grw still mor
irritabl, and it was Princss Mary who gnrally bor th brunt of his
frqunt fits of unprovokd angr. H smd carfully to sk out
hr tndr spots so as to tortur hr mntally as harshly as possibl.
Princss Mary had two passions and consquntly two joys—hr nphw,
littl Nicholas, and rligion—and ths wr th favorit subjcts
of th princ’s attacks and ridicul. Whatvr was spokn of h would
bring round to th suprstitiousnss of old maids, or th ptting
and spoiling of childrn. “You want to mak him”—littl
Nicholas—“into an old maid lik yourslf! A pity! Princ Andrw
wants a son and not an old maid,” h would say. Or, turning to
Madmoisll Bourinn, h would ask hr in Princss Mary’s prsnc
how sh likd our villag prists and icons and would jok about thm.
H continually hurt Princss Mary’s flings and tormntd hr, but it
cost hr no ffort to forgiv him. Could h b to blam toward hr, or
could hr fathr, whom sh knw lovd hr in spit of it all, b unjust?
And what is justic? Th princss nvr thought of that proud word
“justic.” All th complx laws of man cntrd for hr in on clar
and simpl law—th law of lov and slf-sacrific taught us by Him who
lovingly suffrd for mankind though H Himslf was God. What had sh to
do with th justic or injustic of othr popl? Sh had to ndur and
lov, and that sh did.
During th wintr Princ Andrw had com to Bald Hills and had bn gay,
gntl, and mor affctionat than Princss Mary had known him for a
long tim past. Sh flt that somthing had happnd to him, but h said
nothing to hr about his lov. Bfor h lft h had a long talk with
his fathr about somthing, and Princss Mary noticd that bfor his
dpartur thy wr dissatisfid with on anothr.
Soon aftr Princ Andrw had gon, Princss Mary wrot to hr frind
Juli Karágina in Ptrsburg, whom sh had dramd (as all girls dram)
of marrying to hr brothr, and who was at that tim in mourning for hr
own brothr, killd in Turky.
Sorrow, it sms, is our common lot, my dar, tndr frind Juli.
Your loss is so trribl that I can only xplain it to myslf as a
spcial providnc of God who, loving you, wishs to try you and your
xcllnt mothr. Oh, my frind! Rligion, and rligion alon, can—I
will not say comfort us—but sav us from dspair. Rligion alon can
xplain to us what without its hlp man cannot comprhnd: why, for what
caus, kind and nobl bings abl to find happinss in lif—not mrly
harming no on but ncssary to th happinss of othrs—ar calld
away to God, whil crul, uslss, harmful prsons, or such as ar a
burdn to thmslvs and to othrs, ar lft living. Th first dath I
saw, and on I shall nvr forgt—that of my dar sistr-in-law—lft
that imprssion on m. Just as you ask dstiny why your splndid brothr
had to di, so I askd why that angl Lis, who not only nvr wrongd
anyon, but in whos soul thr wr nvr any unkind thoughts, had to
di. And what do you think, dar frind? Fiv yars hav passd sinc
thn, and alrady I, with my ptty undrstanding, bgin to s clarly
why sh had to di, and in what way that dath was but an xprssion
of th infinit goodnss of th Crator, whos vry action, though
gnrally incomprhnsibl to us, is but a manifstation of His infinit
lov for His craturs. Prhaps, I oftn think, sh was too anglically
innocnt to hav th strngth to prform all a mothr’s dutis. As a
young wif sh was irrproachabl; prhaps sh could not hav bn so
as a mothr. As it is, not only has sh lft us, and particularly Princ
Andrw, with th purst rgrts and mmoris, but probably sh will
thr rciv a plac I dar not hop for myslf. But not to spak of
hr alon, that arly and trribl dath has had th most bnficnt
influnc on m and on my brothr in spit of all our grif. Thn, at
th momnt of our loss, ths thoughts could not occur to m; I should
thn hav dismissd thm with horror, but now thy ar vry clar and
crtain. I writ all this to you, dar frind, only to convinc you
of th Gospl truth which has bcom for m a principl of lif: not
a singl hair of our hads will fall without His will. And His will is
govrnd only by infinit lov for us, and so whatvr bfalls us is for
our good.
You ask whthr w shall spnd nxt wintr in Moscow. In spit of my
wish to s you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will
b surprisd to har that th rason for this is Buonapart! Th cas is
this: my fathr’s halth is growing noticably wors, h cannot stand
any contradiction and is bcoming irritabl. This irritability is, as
you know, chifly dirctd to political qustions. H cannot ndur
th notion that Buonapart is ngotiating on qual trms with all th
sovrigns of urop and particularly with our own, th grandson of th
Grat Cathrin! As you know, I am quit indiffrnt to politics, but
from my fathr’s rmarks and his talks with Michal Ivánovich I know
all that gos on in th world and spcially about th honors confrrd
on Buonapart, who only at Bald Hills in th whol world, it sms, is
not accptd as a grat man, still lss as mpror of Franc. And my
fathr cannot stand this. It sms to m that it is chifly bcaus of
his political viws that my fathr is rluctant to spak of going to
Moscow; for h forss th ncountrs that would rsult from his way
of xprssing his viws rgardlss of anybody. All th bnfit h might
driv from a cours of tratmnt h would los as a rsult of th
disputs about Buonapart which would b invitabl. In any cas it will
b dcidd vry shortly.
Our family lif gos on in th old way xcpt for my brothr Andrw’s
absnc. H, as I wrot you bfor, has changd vry much of lat. Aftr
his sorrow h only this yar quit rcovrd his spirits. H has again
bcom as I usd to know him whn a child: kind, affctionat, with that
hart of gold to which I know no qual. H has ralizd, it sms to m,
that lif is not ovr for him. But togthr with this mntal chang
h has grown physically much wakr. H has bcom thinnr and mor
nrvous. I am anxious about him and glad h is taking this trip abroad
which th doctors rcommndd long ago. I hop it will cur him. You
writ that in Ptrsburg h is spokn of as on of th most activ,
cultivatd, and capabl of th young mn. Forgiv my vanity as a
rlation, but I nvr doubtd it. Th good h has don to vrybody
hr, from his pasants up to th gntry, is incalculabl. On his
arrival in Ptrsburg h rcivd only his du. I always wondr at th
way rumors fly from Ptrsburg to Moscow, spcially such fals ons as
that you writ about—I man th rport of my brothr’s btrothal to
th littl Rostóva. I do not think my brothr will vr marry again,
and crtainly not hr; and this is why: first, I know that though h
rarly spaks about th wif h has lost, th grif of that loss
has gon too dp in his hart for him vr to dcid to giv hr a
succssor and our littl angl a stpmothr. Scondly bcaus, as far
as I know, that girl is not th kind of girl who could plas Princ
Andrw. I do not think h would choos hr for a wif, and frankly I do
not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at th nd of my scond
sht. Good-by, my dar frind. May God kp you in His holy and mighty
car. My dar frind, Madmoisll Bourinn, snds you kisss.
MARY
CHAPTR XXVI
In th middl of th summr Princss Mary rcivd an unxpctd lttr
from Princ Andrw in Switzrland in which h gav hr strang and
surprising nws. H informd hr of his ngagmnt to Natásha Rostóva.
Th whol lttr brathd loving raptur for his btrothd and tndr
and confiding affction for his sistr. H wrot that h had nvr lovd
as h did now and that only now did h undrstand and know what lif
was. H askd his sistr to forgiv him for not having told hr of his
rsolv whn h had last visitd Bald Hills, though h had spokn of it
to his fathr. H had not don so for far Princss Mary should ask hr
fathr to giv his consnt, irritating him and having to bar th brunt
of his displasur without attaining hr objct. “Bsids,” h
wrot, “th mattr was not thn so dfinitly sttld as it is now.
My fathr thn insistd on a dlay of a yar and now alrady six months,
half of that priod, hav passd, and my rsolution is firmr than vr.
If th doctors did not kp m hr at th spas I should b back in
Russia, but as it is I hav to postpon my rturn for thr months. You
know m and my rlations with Fathr. I want nothing from him. I hav
bn and always shall b indpndnt; but to go against his will and
arous his angr, now that h may prhaps rmain with us such a short
tim, would dstroy half my happinss. I am now writing to him about
th sam qustion, and bg you to choos a good momnt to hand him th
lttr and to lt m know how h looks at th whol mattr and whthr
thr is hop that h may consnt to rduc th trm by four months.”
Aftr long hsitations, doubts, and prayrs, Princss Mary gav th
lttr to hr fathr. Th nxt day th old princ said to hr quitly:
“Writ and tll your brothr to wait till I am dad.... It won’t b
long—I shall soon st him fr.”
Th princss was about to rply, but hr fathr would not lt hr spak
and, raising his voic mor and mor, crid:
“Marry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clvr popl, h? Rich,
h? Ys, a nic stpmothr littl Nicholas will hav! Writ and tll him
that h may marry tomorrow if h liks. Sh will b littl Nicholas’
stpmothr and I’ll marry Bourinn!... Ha, ha, ha! H mustn’t b
without a stpmothr ithr! Only on thing, no mor womn ar wantd
in my hous—lt him marry and liv by himslf. Prhaps you will go
and liv with him too?” h addd, turning to Princss Mary. “Go in
havn’s nam! Go out into th frost... th frost... th frost!”
Aftr this outburst th princ did not spak any mor about th mattr.
But rprssd vxation at his son’s poor-spiritd bhavior found
xprssion in his tratmnt of his daughtr. To his formr prtxts
for irony a frsh on was now addd—allusions to stpmothrs and
amiabilitis to Madmoisll Bourinn.
“Why shouldn’t I marry hr?” h askd his daughtr. “Sh’ll
mak a splndid princss!”
And lattrly, to hr surpris and bwildrmnt, Princss Mary
noticd that hr fathr was rally associating mor and mor with th
Frnchwoman. Sh wrot to Princ Andrw about th rcption of his
lttr, but comfortd him with hops of rconciling thir fathr to th
ida.
Littl Nicholas and his ducation, hr brothr Andrw, and rligion
wr Princss Mary’s joys and consolations; but bsids that, sinc
vryon must hav prsonal hops, Princss Mary in th profoundst
dpths of hr hart had a hiddn dram and hop that supplid th chif
consolation of hr lif. This comforting dram and hop wr givn hr
by God’s folk—th half-wittd and othr pilgrims who visitd
hr without th princ’s knowldg. Th longr sh livd, th mor
xprinc and obsrvation sh had of lif, th gratr was hr wondr
at th short-sightdnss of mn who sk njoymnt and happinss hr
on arth: toiling, suffring, struggling, and harming on anothr, to
obtain that impossibl, visionary, sinful happinss. Princ Andrw had
lovd his wif, sh did, but that was not nough: h wantd to bind
his happinss to anothr woman. Hr fathr objctd to this bcaus h
wantd a mor distinguishd and walthir match for Andrw. And thy
all struggld and suffrd and tormntd on anothr and injurd thir
souls, thir trnal souls, for th attainmnt of bnfits which ndur
but for an instant. Not only do w know this ourslvs, but Christ, th
Son of God, cam down to arth and told us that this lif is but for
a momnt and is a probation; yt w cling to it and think to find
happinss in it. “How is it that no on ralizs this?” thought
Princss Mary. “No on xcpt ths dspisd God’s folk who, wallt
on back, com to m by th back door, afraid of bing sn by th
princ, not for far of ill-usag by him but for far of causing him
to sin. To lav family, hom, and all th cars of worldly wlfar, in
ordr without clinging to anything to wandr in hmpn rags from plac
to plac undr an assumd nam, doing no on any harm but praying for
all—for thos who driv on away as wll as for thos who protct on:
highr than that lif and truth thr is no lif or truth!”
Thr was on pilgrim, a quit pockmarkd littl woman of fifty calld
Thodosia, who for ovr thirty yars had gon about barfoot and worn
havy chains. Princss Mary was particularly fond of hr. Onc, whn in
a room with a lamp dimly lit bfor th icon Thodosia was talking of
hr lif, th thought that Thodosia alon had found th tru path of
lif suddnly cam to Princss Mary with such forc that sh rsolvd to
bcom a pilgrim hrslf. Whn Thodosia had gon to slp Princss Mary
thought about this for a long tim, and at last mad up hr mind that,
strang as it might sm, sh must go on a pilgrimag. Sh disclosd
this thought to no on but to hr confssor, Fathr Akínfi, th monk,
and h approvd of hr intntion. Undr guis of a prsnt for th
pilgrims, Princss Mary prpard a pilgrim’s complt costum for
hrslf: a coars smock, bast shos, a rough coat, and a black krchif.
Oftn, approaching th chst of drawrs containing this scrt trasur,
Princss Mary pausd, uncrtain whthr th tim had not alrady com to
put hr projct into xcution.
Oftn, listning to th pilgrims’ tals, sh was so stimulatd by
thir simpl spch, mchanical to thm but to hr so full of dp
maning, that svral tims sh was on th point of abandoning
vrything and running away from hom. In imagination sh alrady
picturd hrslf by Thodosia’s sid, drssd in coars rags, walking
with a staff, a wallt on hr back, along th dusty road, dircting hr
wandrings from on saint’s shrin to anothr, fr from nvy, arthly
lov, or dsir, and raching at last th plac whr thr is no mor
sorrow or sighing, but trnal joy and bliss.
“I shall com to a plac and pray thr, and bfor having tim to gt
usd to it or gtting to lov it, I shall go farthr. I will go on till
my lgs fail, and I’ll li down and di somwhr, and shall at last
rach that trnal, quit havn, whr thr is nithr sorrow nor
sighing...” thought Princss Mary.
But aftrwards, whn sh saw hr fathr and spcially littl Koko
(Nicholas), hr rsolv waknd. Sh wpt quitly, and flt that sh
was a sinnr who lovd hr fathr and littl nphw mor than God.

CHAPTR I
Th Bibl lgnd tlls us that th absnc of labor—idlnss—was a
condition of th first man’s blssdnss bfor th Fall. Falln man
has rtaind a lov of idlnss, but th curs wighs on th rac not
only bcaus w hav to sk our brad in th swat of our brows, but
bcaus our moral natur is such that w cannot b both idl and at
as. An innr voic tlls us w ar in th wrong if w ar idl. If man
could find a stat in which h flt that though idl h was fulfilling
his duty, h would hav found on of th conditions of man’s primitiv
blssdnss. And such a stat of obligatory and irrproachabl idlnss
is th lot of a whol class—th military. Th chif attraction of
military srvic has consistd and will consist in this compulsory and
irrproachabl idlnss.
Nicholas Rostóv xprincd this blissful condition to th full whn,
aftr 1807, h continud to srv in th Pávlograd rgimnt, in which
h alrady commandd th squadron h had takn ovr from Dnísov.
Rostóv had bcom a bluff, good-naturd fllow, whom his Moscow
acquaintancs would hav considrd rathr bad form, but who was likd
and rspctd by his comrads, subordinats, and supriors, and was wll
contntd with his lif. Of lat, in 1809, h found in lttrs from hom
mor frqunt complaints from his mothr that thir affairs wr falling
into gratr and gratr disordr, and that it was tim for him to com
back to gladdn and comfort his old parnts.
Rading ths lttrs, Nicholas flt a drad of thir wanting to
tak him away from surroundings in which, protctd from all th
ntanglmnts of lif, h was living so calmly and quitly. H flt that
soonr or latr h would hav to r-ntr that whirlpool of lif, with
its mbarrassmnts and affairs to b straightnd out, its accounts
with stwards, quarrls, and intrigus, its tis, socity, and with
Sónya’s lov and his promis to hr. It was all dradfully difficult
and complicatd; and h rplid to his mothr in cold, formal lttrs
in Frnch, bginning: “My dar Mamma,” and nding: “Your obdint
son,” which said nothing of whn h would rturn. In 1810 h rcivd
lttrs from his parnts, in which thy told him of Natásha’s
ngagmnt to Bolkónski, and that th wdding would b in a yar’s
tim bcaus th old princ mad difficultis. This lttr grivd and
mortifid Nicholas. In th first plac h was sorry that Natásha, for
whom h card mor than for anyon ls in th family, should b lost to
th hom; and scondly, from his hussar point of viw, h rgrttd not
to hav bn thr to show that fllow Bolkónski that connction with
him was no such grat honor aftr all, and that if h lovd Natásha h
might dispns with prmission from his dotard fathr. For a momnt h
hsitatd whthr h should not apply for lav in ordr to s Natásha
bfor sh was marrid, but thn cam th manuvrs, and considrations
about Sónya and about th confusion of thir affairs, and Nicholas
again put it off. But in th spring of that yar, h rcivd a lttr
from his mothr, writtn without his fathr’s knowldg, and that
lttr prsuadd him to rturn. Sh wrot that if h did not com and
tak mattrs in hand, thir whol proprty would b sold by auction and
thy would all hav to go bgging. Th count was so wak, and trustd
Mítnka so much, and was so good-naturd, that vrybody took advantag
of him and things wr going from bad to wors. “For God’s sak, I
implor you, com at onc if you do not wish to mak m and th whol
family wrtchd,” wrot th countss.
This lttr touchd Nicholas. H had that common sns of a
mattr-of-fact man which showd him what h ought to do.
Th right thing now was, if not to rtir from th srvic, at any rat
to go hom on lav. Why h had to go h did not know; but aftr his
aftr-dinnr nap h gav ordrs to saddl Mars, an xtrmly vicious
gray stallion that had not bn riddn for a long tim, and whn
h rturnd with th hors all in a lathr, h informd Lavrúshka
(Dnísov’s srvant who had rmaind with him) and his comrads who
turnd up in th vning that h was applying for lav and was going
hom. Difficult and strang as it was for him to rflct that h would
go away without having hard from th staff—and this intrstd him
xtrmly—whthr h was promotd to a captaincy or would rciv th
Ordr of St. Ann for th last manuvrs; strang as it was to think
that h would go away without having sold his thr roans to th Polish
Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for th horss Rostóv had bttd
h would sll for two thousand rubls; incomprhnsibl as it
smd that th ball th hussars wr giving in honor of th Polish
Madmoisll Przazdzicka (out of rivalry to th Uhlans who had givn
on in honor of thir Polish Madmoisll Borzozowska) would tak plac
without him—h knw h must go away from this good, bright world to
somwhr whr vrything was stupid and confusd. A wk latr h
obtaind his lav. His hussar comrads—not only thos of his own
rgimnt, but th whol brigad—gav Rostóv a dinnr to which th
subscription was fiftn rubls a had, and at which thr wr two
bands and two choirs of singrs. Rostóv dancd th Trpák with Major
Básov; th tipsy officrs tossd, mbracd, and droppd Rostóv; th
soldirs of th third squadron tossd him too, and shoutd “hurrah!”
and thn thy put him in his sligh and scortd him as far as th first
post station.
During th first half of th journy—from Krmnchúg to Kiv—all
Rostóv’s thoughts, as is usual in such cass, wr bhind him, with
th squadron; but whn h had gon mor than halfway h bgan to forgt
his thr roans and Dozhoyvyko, his quartrmastr, and to wondr
anxiously how things would b at Otrádno and what h would find
thr. Thoughts of hom grw strongr th narr h approachd it—far
strongr, as though this fling of his was subjct to th law by which
th forc of attraction is in invrs proportion to th squar of th
distanc. At th last post station bfor Otrádno h gav th drivr a
thr-rubl tip, and on arriving h ran brathlssly, lik a boy, up th
stps of his hom.
Aftr th raptur of mting, and aftr that odd fling of unsatisfid
xpctation—th fling that “vrything is just th sam, so why
did I hurry?”—Nicholas bgan to sttl down in his old hom world.
His fathr and mothr wr much th sam, only a littl oldr. What was
nw in thm was a crtain unasinss and occasional discord, which thr
usd not to b, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was du to th
bad stat of thir affairs. Sónya was narly twnty; sh had stoppd
growing prttir and promisd nothing mor than sh was alrady, but
that was nough. Sh xhald happinss and lov from th tim Nicholas
rturnd, and th faithful, unaltrabl lov of this girl had a
gladdning ffct on him. Ptya and Natásha surprisd Nicholas
most. Ptya was a big handsom boy of thirtn, mrry, witty, and
mischivous, with a voic that was alrady braking. As for Natásha,
for a long whil Nicholas wondrd and laughd whnvr h lookd at
hr.
“You’r not th sam at all,” h said.
“How? Am I uglir?”
“On th contrary, but what dignity? A princss!” h whisprd to
hr.
“Ys, ys, ys!” crid Natásha, joyfully.
Sh told him about hr romanc with Princ Andrw and of his visit to
Otrádno and showd him his last lttr.
“Wll, ar you glad?” Natásha askd. “I am so tranquil and happy
now.”
“Vry glad,” answrd Nicholas. “H is an xcllnt fllow.... And
ar you vry much in lov?”
“How shall I put it?” rplid Natásha. “I was in lov with
Borís, with my tachr, and with Dnísov, but this is quit diffrnt.
I fl at pac and sttld. I know that no bttr man than h xists,
and I am calm and contntd now. Not at all as bfor.”
Nicholas xprssd his disapproval of th postponmnt of th marriag
for a yar; but Natásha attackd hr brothr with xaspration, proving
to him that it could not b othrwis, and that it would b a bad thing
to ntr a family against th fathr’s will, and that sh hrslf
wishd it so.
“You don’t at all undrstand,” sh said.
Nicholas was silnt and agrd with hr.
Hr brothr oftn wondrd as h lookd at hr. Sh did not sm at
all lik a girl in lov and partd from hr affiancd husband. Sh was
vn-tmprd and calm and quit as chrful as of old. This amazd
Nicholas and vn mad him rgard Bolkónski’s courtship skptically.
H could not bliv that hr fat was sald, spcially as h had
not sn hr with Princ Andrw. It always smd to him that thr was
somthing not quit right about this intndd marriag.
“Why this dlay? Why no btrothal?” h thought. Onc, whn h had
touchd on this topic with his mothr, h discovrd, to his surpris
and somwhat to his satisfaction, that in th dpth of hr soul sh too
had doubts about this marriag.
“You s h writs,” said sh, showing hr son a lttr of Princ
Andrw’s, with that latnt grudg a mothr always has in rgard to a
daughtr’s futur marrid happinss, “h writs that h won’t com
bfor Dcmbr. What can b kping him? Illnss, probably! His halth
is vry dlicat. Don’t tll Natásha. And don’t attach importanc
to hr bing so bright: that’s bcaus sh’s living through th last
days of hr girlhood, but I know what sh is lik vry tim w rciv
a lttr from him! Howvr, God grant that vrything turns out wll!”
(Sh always ndd with ths words.) “H is an xcllnt man!”
CHAPTR II
Aftr raching hom Nicholas was at first srious and vn dull. H was
worrid by th impnding ncssity of intrfring in th stupid businss
mattrs for which his mothr had calld him hom. To throw off this
burdn as quickly as possibl, on th third day aftr his arrival h
wnt, angry and scowling and without answring qustions as to whr h
was going, to Mítnka’s lodg and dmandd an account of vrything.
But what an account of vrything might b Nicholas knw vn lss
than th frightnd and bwildrd Mítnka. Th convrsation and th
xamination of th accounts with Mítnka did not last long. Th villag
ldr, a pasant dlgat, and th villag clrk, who wr waiting in
th passag, hard with far and dlight first th young count’s voic
roaring and snapping and rising loudr and loudr, and thn words of
abus, dradful words, jaculatd on aftr th othr.
“Robbr!... Ungratful wrtch!... I’ll hack th dog to pics! I’m
not my fathr!... Robbing us!...” and so on.
Thn with no lss far and dlight thy saw how th young count, rd in
th fac and with bloodshot ys, draggd Mítnka out by th scruff of
th nck and applid his foot and kn to his bhind with grat agility
at convnint momnts btwn th words, shouting, “B off! Nvr lt
m s your fac hr again, you villain!”
Mítnka flw hadlong down th six stps and ran away into th
shrubbry. (This shrubbry was a wll-known havn of rfug for culprits
at Otrádno. Mítnka himslf, rturning tipsy from th town, usd
to hid thr, and many of th rsidnts at Otrádno, hiding from
Mítnka, knw of its protctiv qualitis.)
Mítnka’s wif and sistrs-in-law thrust thir hads and frightnd
facs out of th door of a room whr a bright samovar was boiling and
whr th stward’s high bdstad stood with its patchwork quilt.
Th young count paid no hd to thm, but, brathing hard, passd by
with rsolut strids and wnt into th hous.
Th countss, who hard at onc from th maids what had happnd at th
lodg, was calmd by th thought that now thir affairs would crtainly
improv, but on th othr hand flt anxious as to th ffct this
xcitmnt might hav on hr son. Sh wnt svral tims to his door on
tipto and listnd, as h lightd on pip aftr anothr.
Nxt day th old count calld his son asid and, with an mbarrassd
smil, said to him:
“But you know, my dar boy, it’s a pity you got xcitd! Mítnka
has told m all about it.”
“I knw,” thought Nicholas, “that I should nvr undrstand
anything in this crazy world.”
“You wr angry that h had not ntrd thos 700 rubls. But thy
wr carrid forward—and you did not look at th othr pag.”
“Papa, h is a blackguard and a thif! I know h is! And what I hav
don, I hav don; but, if you lik, I won’t spak to him again.”
“No, my dar boy” (th count, too, flt mbarrassd. H knw h had
mismanagd his wif’s proprty and was to blam toward his childrn,
but h did not know how to rmdy it). “No, I bg you to attnd to th
businss. I am old. I...”
“No, Papa. Forgiv m if I hav causd you unplasantnss. I
undrstand it all lss than you do.”
“Dvil tak all ths pasants, and mony mattrs, and carryings
forward from pag to pag,” h thought. “I usd to undrstand what
a ‘cornr’ and th staks at cards mant, but carrying forward to
anothr pag I don’t undrstand at all,” said h to himslf, and
aftr that h did not mddl in businss affairs. But onc th countss
calld hr son and informd him that sh had a promissory not from Anna
Mikháylovna for two thousand rubls, and askd him what h thought of
doing with it.
“This,” answrd Nicholas. “You say it rsts with m. Wll, I
don’t lik Anna Mikháylovna and I don’t lik Borís, but thy wr
our frinds and poor. Wll thn, this!” and h tor up th not, and
by so doing causd th old countss to wp tars of joy. Aftr that,
young Rostóv took no furthr part in any businss affairs, but
dvotd himslf with passionat nthusiasm to what was to him a nw
pursuit—th chas—for which his fathr kpt a larg stablishmnt.
CHAPTR III
Th wathr was alrady growing wintry and morning frosts congald
an arth saturatd by autumn rains. Th vrdur had thicknd and its
bright grn stood out sharply against th brownish strips of wintr ry
troddn down by th cattl, and against th pal-yllow stubbl of th
spring buckwhat. Th woodd ravins and th copss, which at th nd of
August had still bn grn islands amid black filds and stubbl, had
bcom goldn and bright-rd islands amid th grn wintr ry. Th
hars had alrady half changd thir summr coats, th fox cubs wr
bginning to scattr, and th young wolvs wr biggr than dogs. It was
th bst tim of th yar for th chas. Th hounds of that ardnt young
sportsman Rostóv had not mrly rachd hard wintr condition, but wr
so jadd that at a mting of th huntsmn it was dcidd to giv thm
a thr days’ rst and thn, on th sixtnth of Sptmbr, to go on
a distant xpdition, starting from th oak grov whr thr was an
undisturbd littr of wolf cubs.
All that day th hounds rmaind at hom. It was frosty and th air was
sharp, but toward vning th sky bcam ovrcast and it bgan to thaw.
On th fiftnth, whn young Rostóv, in his drssing gown, lookd out
of th window, h saw it was an unsurpassabl morning for hunting: it
was as if th sky wr mlting and sinking to th arth without any
wind. Th only motion in th air was that of th dripping, microscopic
particls of drizzling mist. Th bar twigs in th gardn wr hung with
transparnt drops which fll on th frshly falln lavs. Th arth in
th kitchn gardn lookd wt and black and glistnd lik poppy sd
and at a short distanc mrgd into th dull, moist vil of mist.
Nicholas wnt out into th wt and muddy porch. Thr was a smll of
dcaying lavs and of dog. Mílka, a black-spottd, broad-haunchd
bitch with prominnt black ys, got up on sing hr mastr, strtchd
hr hind lgs, lay down lik a har, and thn suddnly jumpd up and
lickd him right on his nos and mustach. Anothr borzoi, a dog,
catching sight of his mastr from th gardn path, archd his back
and, rushing hadlong toward th porch with liftd tail, bgan rubbing
himslf against his lgs.
“O-hoy!” cam at that momnt, that inimitabl huntsman’s call
which units th dpst bass with th shrillst tnor, and round
th cornr cam Danil th had huntsman and had knnlman, a gray,
wrinkld old man with hair cut straight ovr his forhad, Ukrainian
fashion, a long bnt whip in his hand, and that look of indpndnc
and scorn of vrything that is only sn in huntsmn. H doffd his
Circassian cap to his mastr and lookd at him scornfully. This scorn
was not offnsiv to his mastr. Nicholas knw that this Danil,
disdainful of vrybody and who considrd himslf abov thm, was all
th sam his srf and huntsman.
“Danil!” Nicholas said timidly, conscious at th sight of th
wathr, th hounds, and th huntsman that h was bing carrid away
by that irrsistibl passion for sport which maks a man forgt all
his prvious rsolutions, as a lovr forgts in th prsnc of his
mistrss.
“What ordrs, your xcllncy?” said th huntsman in his dp bass,
dp as a proto-dacon’s and hoars with hallooing—and two flashing
black ys gazd from undr his brows at his mastr, who was silnt.
“Can you rsist it?” thos ys smd to b asking.
“It’s a good day, h? For a hunt and a gallop, h?” askd
Nicholas, scratching Mílka bhind th ars.
Danil did not answr, but winkd instad.
“I snt Uvárka at dawn to listn,” his bass boomd out aftr a
minut’s paus. “H says sh’s movd thm into th Otrádno
nclosur. Thy wr howling thr.” (This mant that th sh-wolf,
about whom thy both knw, had movd with hr cubs to th Otrádno
cops, a small plac a mil and a half from th hous.)
“W ought to go, don’t you think so?” said Nicholas. “Com to m
with Uvárka.”
“As you plas.”
“Thn put off fding thm.”
“Ys, sir.”
Fiv minuts latr Danil and Uvárka wr standing in Nicholas’ big
study. Though Danil was not a big man, to s him in a room was
lik sing a hors or a bar on th floor among th furnitur and
surroundings of human lif. Danil himslf flt this, and as usual stood
just insid th door, trying to spak softly and not mov, for far of
braking somthing in th mastr’s apartmnt, and h hastnd to say
all that was ncssary so as to gt from undr that ciling, out into
th opn undr th sky onc mor.
Having finishd his inquiris and xtortd from Danil an opinion that
th hounds wr fit (Danil himslf wishd to go hunting), Nicholas
ordrd th horss to b saddld. But just as Danil was about to
go Natásha cam in with rapid stps, not having don up hr hair or
finishd drssing and with hr old nurs’s big shawl wrappd round
hr. Ptya ran in at th sam tim.
“You ar going?” askd Natásha. “I knw you would! Sónya said
you wouldn’t go, but I knw that today is th sort of day whn you
couldn’t hlp going.”
“Ys, w ar going,” rplid Nicholas rluctantly, for today, as h
intndd to hunt sriously, h did not want to tak Natásha and Ptya.
“W ar going, but only wolf hunting: it would b dull for you.”
“You know it is my gratst plasur,” said Natásha. “It’s not
fair; you ar going by yourslf, ar having th horss saddld and said
nothing to us about it.”
“‘No barrir bars a Russian’s path’—w’ll go!” shoutd
Ptya.
“But you can’t. Mamma said you mustn’t,” said Nicholas to
Natásha.
“Ys, I’ll go. I shall crtainly go,” said Natásha dcisivly.
“Danil, tll thm to saddl for us, and Michal must com with my
dogs,” sh addd to th huntsman.
It smd to Danil irksom and impropr to b in a room at all, but to
hav anything to do with a young lady smd to him impossibl. H
cast down his ys and hurrid out as if it wr non of his businss,
carful as h wnt not to inflict any accidntal injury on th young
lady.
CHAPTR IV
Th old count, who had always kpt up an normous hunting stablishmnt
but had now handd it all compltly ovr to his son’s car, bing
in vry good spirits on this fiftnth of Sptmbr, prpard to go out
with th othrs.
In an hour’s tim th whol hunting party was at th porch. Nicholas,
with a strn and srious air which showd that now was no tim for
attnding to trifls, wnt past Natásha and Ptya who wr trying to
tll him somthing. H had a look at all th dtails of th hunt, snt
a pack of hounds and huntsmn on ahad to find th quarry, mountd his
chstnut Donts, and whistling to his own lash of borzois, st off
across th thrshing ground to a fild lading to th Otrádno wood.
Th old count’s hors, a sorrl glding calld Viflyánka, was ld by
th groom in attndanc on him, whil th count himslf was to driv in
a small trap straight to a spot rsrvd for him.
Thy wr taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attndants and
whipprs-in. Bsids th family, thr wr ight borzoi knnlmn
and mor than forty borzois, so that, with th borzois on th lash
blonging to mmbrs of th family, thr wr about a hundrd and
thirty dogs and twnty horsmn.
ach dog knw its mastr and its call. ach man in th hunt knw his
businss, his plac, what h had to do. As soon as thy had passd th
fnc thy all sprad out vnly and quitly, without nois or talk,
along th road and fild lading to th Otrádno covrt.
Th horss stppd ovr th fild as ovr a thick carpt, now and thn
splashing into puddls as thy crossd a road. Th misty sky still
smd to dscnd vnly and imprcptibly toward th arth, th air
was still, warm, and silnt. Occasionally th whistl of a huntsman,
th snort of a hors, th crack of a whip, or th whin of a straggling
hound could b hard.
Whn thy had gon a littl lss than a mil, fiv mor ridrs with
dogs appard out of th mist, approaching th Rostóvs. In front rod a
frsh-looking, handsom old man with a larg gray mustach.
“Good morning, Uncl!” said Nicholas, whn th old man drw nar.
“That’s it. Com on!... I was sur of it,” bgan “Uncl.” (H
was a distant rlativ of th Rostóvs’, a man of small mans, and
thir nighbor.) “I knw you wouldn’t b abl to rsist it and
it’s a good thing you’r going. That’s it! Com on!” (This was
“Uncl’s” favorit xprssion.) “Tak th covrt at onc, for my
Gírchik says th Ilágins ar at Kornikí with thir hounds. That’s
it. Com on!... Thy’ll tak th cubs from undr your vry nos.”
“That’s whr I’m going. Shall w join up our packs?” askd
Nicholas.
Th hounds wr joind into on pack, and “Uncl” and Nicholas rod
on sid by sid. Natásha, muffld up in shawls which did not hid hr
agr fac and shining ys, gallopd up to thm. Sh was followd by
Ptya who always kpt clos to hr, by Michal, a huntsman, and by a
groom appointd to look aftr hr. Ptya, who was laughing, whippd and
pulld at his hors. Natásha sat asily and confidntly on hr black
Arábchik and rind him in without ffort with a firm hand.
“Uncl” lookd round disapprovingly at Ptya and Natásha. H did
not lik to combin frivolity with th srious businss of hunting.
“Good morning, Uncl! W ar going too!” shoutd Ptya.
“Good morning, good morning! But don’t go ovrriding th hounds,”
said “Uncl” strnly.
“Nicholas, what a fin dog Truníla is! H knw m,” said Natásha,
rfrring to hr favorit hound.
“In th first plac, Truníla is not a ‘dog,’ but a harrir,”
thought Nicholas, and lookd strnly at his sistr, trying to mak hr
fl th distanc that ought to sparat thm at that momnt. Natásha
undrstood it.
“You mustn’t think w’ll b in anyon’s way, Uncl,” sh said.
“W’ll go to our placs and won’t budg.”
“A good thing too, littl countss,” said “Uncl,” “only mind
you don’t fall off your hors,” h addd, “bcaus—that’s it,
com on!—you’v nothing to hold on to.”
Th oasis of th Otrádno covrt cam in sight a fw hundrd yards off,
th huntsmn wr alrady naring it. Rostóv, having finally sttld
with “Uncl” whr thy should st on th hounds, and having shown
Natásha whr sh was to stand—a spot whr nothing could possibly
run out—wnt round abov th ravin.
“Wll, nphw, you’r going for a big wolf,” said “Uncl.”
“Mind and don’t lt hr slip!”
“That’s as may happn,” answrd Rostóv. “Karáy, hr!” h
shoutd, answring “Uncl’s” rmark by this call to his borzoi.
Karáy was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having
tackld a big wolf unaidd. Thy all took up thir placs.
Th old count, knowing his son’s ardor in th hunt, hurrid so as not
to b lat, and th huntsmn had not yt rachd thir placs whn Count
Ilyá Rostóv, chrful, flushd, and with quivring chks, drov up
with his black horss ovr th wintr ry to th plac rsrvd for him,
whr a wolf might com out. Having straightnd his coat and fastnd
on his hunting knivs and horn, h mountd his good, slk, wll-fd,
and comfortabl hors, Viflyánka, which was turning gray, lik himslf.
His horss and trap wr snt hom. Count Ilyá Rostóv, though not at
hart a kn sportsman, knw th ruls of th hunt wll, and rod to
th bushy dg of th road whr h was to stand, arrangd his rins,
sttld himslf in th saddl, and, fling that h was rady, lookd
about with a smil.
Bsid him was Simon Chkmár, his prsonal attndant, an old horsman
now somwhat stiff in th saddl. Chkmár hld in lash thr
formidabl wolfhounds, who had, howvr, grown fat lik thir mastr
and his hors. Two wis old dogs lay down unlashd. Som hundrd pacs
farthr along th dg of th wood stood Mítka, th count’s othr
groom, a daring horsman and kn ridr to hounds. Bfor th hunt, by
old custom, th count had drunk a silvr cupful of mulld brandy, takn
a snack, and washd it down with half a bottl of his favorit Bordaux.
H was somwhat flushd with th win and th driv. His ys wr
rathr moist and glittrd mor than usual, and as h sat in his saddl,
wrappd up in his fur coat, h lookd lik a child takn out for an
outing.
Th thin, hollow-chkd Chkmár, having got vrything rady, kpt
glancing at his mastr with whom h had livd on th bst of trms for
thirty yars, and undrstanding th mood h was in xpctd a plasant
chat. A third prson rod up circumspctly through th wood (it was
plain that h had had a lsson) and stoppd bhind th count. This
prson was a gray-bardd old man in a woman’s cloak, with a tall
pakd cap on his had. H was th buffoon, who wnt by a woman’s
nam, Nastásya Ivánovna.
“Wll, Nastásya Ivánovna!” whisprd th count, winking at him.
“If you scar away th bast, Danil’ll giv it you!”
“I know a thing or two myslf!” said Nastásya Ivánovna.
“Hush!” whisprd th count and turnd to Simon. “Hav you sn
th young countss?” h askd. “Whr is sh?”
“With young Count Ptr, by th Zhárov rank grass,” answrd Simon,
smiling. “Though sh’s a lady, sh’s vry fond of hunting.”
“And you’r surprisd at th way sh rids, Simon, h?” said th
count. “Sh’s as good as many a man!”
“Of cours! It’s marvlous. So bold, so asy!”
“And Nicholas? Whr is h? By th Lyádov upland, isn’t h?”
“Ys, sir. H knows whr to stand. H undrstands th mattr so wll
that Danil and I ar oftn quit astoundd,” said Simon, wll knowing
what would plas his mastr.
“Rids wll, h? And how wll h looks on his hors, h?”
“A prfct pictur! How h chasd a fox out of th rank grass by th
Zavárzinsk thickt th othr day! Lapd a farful plac; what a sight
whn thy rushd from th covrt... th hors worth a thousand rubls
and th ridr byond all pric! Ys, on would hav to sarch far to
find anothr as smart.”
“To sarch far...” rpatd th count, vidntly sorry Simon had not
said mor. “To sarch far,” h said, turning back th skirt of his
coat to gt at his snuffbox.
“Th othr day whn h cam out from Mass in full uniform, Michal
Sidórych...” Simon did not finish, for on th still air h had
distinctly caught th music of th hunt with only two or thr hounds
giving tongu. H bnt down his had and listnd, shaking a warning
fingr at his mastr. “Thy ar on th scnt of th cubs...” h
whisprd, “straight to th Lyádov uplands.”
Th count, forgtting to smooth out th smil on his fac, lookd into
th distanc straight bfor him, down th narrow opn spac, holding
th snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. Aftr th cry of th hounds
cam th dp tons of th wolf call from Danil’s hunting horn; th
pack joind th first thr hounds and thy could b hard in full cry,
with that pculiar lift in th not that indicats that thy ar aftr
a wolf. Th whipprs-in no longr st on th hounds, but changd to th
cry of ulyulyu, and abov th othrs ros Danil’s voic, now a dp
bass, now pircingly shrill. His voic smd to fill th whol wood and
carrid far byond out into th opn fild.
Aftr listning a fw momnts in silnc, th count and his attndant
convincd thmslvs that th hounds had sparatd into two packs: th
sound of th largr pack, agrly giving tongu, bgan to di away in
th distanc, th othr pack rushd by th wood past th count, and
it was with this that Danil’s voic was hard calling ulyulyu.
Th sounds of both packs mingld and brok apart again, but both wr
bcoming mor distant.
Simon sighd and stoopd to straightn th lash a young borzoi had
ntangld; th count too sighd and, noticing th snuffbox in his hand,
opnd it and took a pinch. “Back!” crid Simon to a borzoi that
was pushing forward out of th wood. Th count startd and droppd th
snuffbox. Nastásya Ivánovna dismountd to pick it up. Th count and
Simon wr looking at him.
Thn, unxpctdly, as oftn happns, th sound of th hunt suddnly
approachd, as if th hounds in full cry and Danil ulyulyuing wr just
in front of thm.
Th count turnd and saw on his right Mítka staring at him with ys
starting out of his had, raising his cap and pointing bfor him to th
othr sid.
“Look out!” h shoutd, in a voic plainly showing that h had long
frttd to uttr that word, and ltting th borzois slip h gallopd
toward th count.
Th count and Simon gallopd out of th wood and saw on thir lft a
wolf which, softly swaying from sid to sid, was coming at a quit
lop farthr to th lft to th vry plac whr thy wr standing.
Th angry borzois whind and gtting fr of th lash rushd past th
horss’ ft at th wolf.
Th wolf pausd, turnd its havy forhad toward th dogs awkwardly,
lik a man suffring from th quinsy, and, still slightly swaying
from sid to sid, gav a coupl of laps and with a swish of its tail
disappard into th skirt of th wood. At th sam instant, with a cry
lik a wail, first on hound, thn anothr, and thn anothr, sprang
hltr-skltr from th wood opposit and th whol pack rushd across
th fild toward th vry spot whr th wolf had disappard. Th hazl
bushs partd bhind th hounds and Danil’s chstnut hors appard,
dark with swat. On its long back sat Danil, hunchd forward, caplss,
his dishvld gray hair hanging ovr his flushd, prspiring fac.
“Ulyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...” h crid. Whn h caught sight of th
count his ys flashd lightning.
“Blast you!” h shoutd, holding up his whip thratningly at th
count.
“You’v lt th wolf go!... What sportsmn!” and as if scorning to
say mor to th frightnd and shamfacd count, h lashd th having
flanks of his swating chstnut glding with all th angr th count
had arousd and flw off aftr th hounds. Th count, lik a punishd
schoolboy, lookd round, trying by a smil to win Simon’s sympathy for
his plight. But Simon was no longr thr. H was galloping round by th
bushs whil th fild was coming up on both sids, all trying to had
th wolf, but it vanishd into th wood bfor thy could do so.
CHAPTR V
Nicholas Rostóv manwhil rmaind at his post, waiting for th wolf.
By th way th hunt approachd and rcdd, by th cris of th dogs
whos nots wr familiar to him, by th way th voics of th huntsmn
approachd, rcdd, and ros, h ralizd what was happning at th
cops. H knw that young and old wolvs wr thr, that th hounds had
sparatd into two packs, that somwhr a wolf was bing chasd, and
that somthing had gon wrong. H xpctd th wolf to com his way any
momnt. H mad thousands of diffrnt conjcturs as to whr and
from what sid th bast would com and how h would st upon it. Hop
altrnatd with dspair. Svral tims h addrssd a prayr to God
that th wolf should com his way. H prayd with that passionat and
shamfacd fling with which mn pray at momnts of grat xcitmnt
arising from trivial causs. “What would it b to Th to do this for
m?” h said to God. “I know Thou art grat, and that it is a sin to
ask this of Th, but for God’s sak do lt th old wolf com my way
and lt Karáy spring at it—in sight of ‘Uncl’ who is watching
from ovr thr—and siz it by th throat in a dath grip!” A
thousand tims during that half-hour Rostóv cast agr and rstlss
glancs ovr th dg of th wood, with th two scraggy oaks rising
abov th aspn undrgrowth and th gully with its watr-worn sid and
“Uncl’s” cap just visibl abov th bush on his right.
“No, I shan’t hav such luck,” thought Rostóv, “yt what
wouldn’t it b worth! It is not to b! vrywhr, at cards and in
war, I am always unlucky.” Mmoris of Austrlitz and of Dólokhov
flashd rapidly and clarly through his mind. “Only onc in my lif
to gt an old wolf, I want only that!” thought h, straining ys and
ars and looking to th lft and thn to th right and listning to th
slightst variation of not in th cris of th dogs.
Again h lookd to th right and saw somthing running toward him across
th dsrtd fild. “No, it can’t b!” thought Rostóv, taking a
dp brath, as a man dos at th coming of somthing long hopd for.
Th hight of happinss was rachd—and so simply, without warning, or
nois, or display, that Rostóv could not bliv his ys and rmaind
in doubt for ovr a scond. Th wolf ran forward and jumpd havily ovr
a gully that lay in hr path. Sh was an old animal with a gray back and
big rddish blly. Sh ran without hurry, vidntly fling sur that no
on saw hr. Rostóv, holding his brath, lookd round at th borzois.
Thy stood or lay not sing th wolf or undrstanding th situation.
Old Karáy had turnd his had and was angrily sarching for flas,
baring his yllow tth and snapping at his hind lgs.
“Ulyulyulyu!” whisprd Rostóv, pouting his lips. Th borzois
jumpd up, jrking th rings of th lashs and pricking thir ars.
Karáy finishd scratching his hindquartrs and, cocking his ars, got
up with quivring tail from which tufts of mattd hair hung down.
“Shall I loos thm or not?” Nicholas askd himslf as th wolf
approachd him coming from th cops. Suddnly th wolf’s whol
physiognomy changd: sh shuddrd, sing what sh had probably nvr
sn bfor—human ys fixd upon hr—and turning hr had a littl
toward Rostóv, sh pausd.
“Back or forward? h, no mattr, forward...” th wolf smd to say
to hrslf, and sh movd forward without again looking round and with a
quit, long, asy yt rsolut lop.
“Ulyulyu!” crid Nicholas, in a voic not his own, and of its own
accord his good hors dartd hadlong downhill, laping ovr gullis
to had off th wolf, and th borzois passd it, running fastr still.
Nicholas did not har his own cry nor fl that h was galloping, nor
s th borzois, nor th ground ovr which h wnt: h saw only th
wolf, who, incrasing hr spd, boundd on in th sam dirction along
th hollow. Th first to com into viw was Mílka, with hr black
markings and powrful quartrs, gaining upon th wolf. Narr and
narr... now sh was ahad of it; but th wolf turnd its had to fac
hr, and instad of putting on spd as sh usually did Mílka suddnly
raisd hr tail and stiffnd hr forlgs.
“Ulyulyulyulyu!” shoutd Nicholas.
Th rddish Lyubím rushd forward from bhind Mílka, sprang
imptuously at th wolf, and sizd it by its hindquartrs, but
immdiatly jumpd asid in trror. Th wolf crouchd, gnashd hr
tth, and again ros and boundd forward, followd at th distanc of a
coupl of ft by all th borzois, who did not gt any closr to hr.
“Sh’ll gt away! No, it’s impossibl!” thought Nicholas, still
shouting with a hoars voic.
“Karáy, ulyulyu!...” h shoutd, looking round for th old borzoi
who was now his only hop. Karáy, with all th strngth ag had lft
him, strtchd himslf to th utmost and, watching th wolf, gallopd
havily asid to intrcpt it. But th quicknss of th wolf’s
lop and th borzoi’s slowr pac mad it plain that Karáy had
miscalculatd. Nicholas could alrady s not far in front of him th
wood whr th wolf would crtainly scap should sh rach it. But,
coming toward him, h saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost
straight at th wolf. Thr was still hop. A long, yllowish
young borzoi, on Nicholas did not know, from anothr lash, rushd
imptuously at th wolf from in front and almost knockd hr ovr. But
th wolf jumpd up mor quickly than anyon could hav xpctd and,
gnashing hr tth, flw at th yllowish borzoi, which, with a pircing
ylp, fll with its had on th ground, blding from a gash in its
sid.
“Karáy? Old fllow!...” waild Nicholas.
Thanks to th dlay causd by this crossing of th wolf’s path, th
old dog with its fltd hair hanging from its thigh was within fiv
pacs of it. As if awar of hr dangr, th wolf turnd hr ys on
Karáy, tuckd hr tail yt furthr btwn hr lgs, and incrasd
hr spd. But hr Nicholas only saw that somthing happnd to
Karáy—th borzoi was suddnly on th wolf, and thy rolld togthr
down into a gully just in front of thm.
That instant, whn Nicholas saw th wolf struggling in th gully
with th dogs, whil from undr thm could b sn hr gray hair and
outstrtchd hind lg and hr frightnd choking had, with hr ars
laid back (Karáy was pinning hr by th throat), was th happist
momnt of his lif. With his hand on his saddlbow, h was rady to
dismount and stab th wolf, whn sh suddnly thrust hr had up from
among that mass of dogs, and thn hr forpaws wr on th dg of th
gully. Sh clickd hr tth (Karáy no longr had hr by th throat),
lapd with a movmnt of hr hind lgs out of th gully, and having
disngagd hrslf from th dogs, with tail tuckd in again, wnt
forward. Karáy, his hair bristling, and probably bruisd or woundd,
climbd with difficulty out of th gully.
“Oh my God! Why?” Nicholas crid in dspair.
“Uncl’s” huntsman was galloping from th othr sid across th
wolf’s path and his borzois onc mor stoppd th animal’s advanc.
Sh was again hmmd in.
Nicholas and his attndant, with “Uncl” and his huntsman, wr all
riding round th wolf, crying “ulyulyu!” shouting and prparing to
dismount ach momnt that th wolf crouchd back, and starting forward
again vry tim sh shook hrslf and movd toward th wood whr sh
would b saf.
Alrady, at th bginning of this chas, Danil, haring th ulyulyuing,
had rushd out from th wood. H saw Karáy siz th wolf, and chckd
his hors, supposing th affair to b ovr. But whn h saw that th
horsmn did not dismount and that th wolf shook hrslf and ran for
safty, Danil st his chstnut galloping, not at th wolf but straight
toward th wood, just as Karáy had run to cut th animal off. As
a rsult of this, h gallopd up to th wolf just whn sh had bn
stoppd a scond tim by “Uncl’s” borzois.
Danil gallopd up silntly, holding a nakd daggr in his lft hand and
thrashing th laboring sids of his chstnut hors with his whip as if
it wr a flail.
Nicholas nithr saw nor hard Danil until th chstnut, brathing
havily, pantd past him, and h hard th fall of a body and saw Danil
lying on th wolf’s back among th dogs, trying to siz hr by th
ars. It was vidnt to th dogs, th huntrs, and to th wolf hrslf
that all was now ovr. Th trrifid wolf prssd back hr ars and
trid to ris, but th borzois stuck to hr. Danil ros a littl, took
a stp, and with his whol wight, as if lying down to rst, fll on
th wolf, sizing hr by th ars. Nicholas was about to stab hr, but
Danil whisprd, “Don’t! W’ll gag hr!” and, changing his
position, st his foot on th wolf’s nck. A stick was thrust btwn
hr jaws and sh was fastnd with a lash, as if bridld, hr lgs wr
bound togthr, and Danil rolld hr ovr onc or twic from sid to
sid.
With happy, xhaustd facs, thy laid th old wolf, aliv, on a shying
and snorting hors and, accompanid by th dogs ylping at hr, took hr
to th plac whr thy wr all to mt. Th hounds had killd two of
th cubs and th borzois thr. Th huntsmn assmbld with thir booty
and thir storis, and all cam to look at th wolf, which, with hr
broad-browd had hanging down and th bittn stick btwn hr jaws,
gazd with grat glassy ys at this crowd of dogs and mn surrounding
hr. Whn sh was touchd, sh jrkd hr bound lgs and lookd wildly
yt simply at vrybody. Old Count Rostóv also rod up and touchd th
wolf.
“Oh, what a formidabl on!” said h. “A formidabl on, h?” h
askd Danil, who was standing nar.
“Ys, your xcllncy,” answrd Danil, quickly doffing his cap.
Th count rmmbrd th wolf h had lt slip and his ncountr with
Danil.
“Ah, but you ar a crusty fllow, frind!” said th count.
For sol rply Danil gav him a shy, childlik, mk, and amiabl
smil.
CHAPTR VI
Th old count wnt hom, and Natásha and Ptya promisd to rturn vry
soon, but as it was still arly th hunt wnt farthr. At midday
thy put th hounds into a ravin thickly ovrgrown with young trs.
Nicholas standing in a fallow fild could s all his whips.
Facing him lay a fild of wintr ry, thr his own huntsman stood alon
in a hollow bhind a hazl bush. Th hounds had scarcly bn loosd
bfor Nicholas hard on h knw, Voltórn, giving tongu at intrvals;
othr hounds joind in, now pausing and now again giving tongu. A
momnt latr h hard a cry from th woodd ravin that a fox had bn
found, and th whol pack, joining togthr, rushd along th ravin
toward th ryfild and away from Nicholas.
H saw th whips in thir rd caps galloping along th dg of th
ravin, h vn saw th hounds, and was xpcting a fox to show itslf
at any momnt on th ryfild opposit.
Th huntsman standing in th hollow movd and loosd his borzois, and
Nicholas saw a qur, short-lggd rd fox with a fin brush going hard
across th fild. Th borzois bor down on it.... Now thy drw clos
to th fox which bgan to dodg btwn th fild in sharpr and sharpr
curvs, trailing its brush, whn suddnly a strang whit borzoi dashd
in followd by a black on, and vrything was in confusion; th borzois
formd a star-shapd figur, scarcly swaying thir bodis and with
tails turnd away from th cntr of th group. Two huntsmn gallopd up
to th dogs; on in a rd cap, th othr, a strangr, in a grn coat.
“What’s this?” thought Nicholas. “Whr’s that huntsman from?
H is not ‘Uncl’s’ man.”
Th huntsmn got th fox, but stayd thr a long tim without strapping
it to th saddl. Thir horss, bridld and with high saddls, stood
nar thm and thr too th dogs wr lying. Th huntsmn wavd thir
arms and did somthing to th fox. Thn from that spot cam th sound of
a horn, with th signal agrd on in cas of a fight.
“That’s Ilágin’s huntsman having a row with our Iván,” said
Nicholas’ groom.
Nicholas snt th man to call Natásha and Ptya to him, and rod at a
footpac to th plac whr th whips wr gtting th hounds togthr.
Svral of th fild gallopd to th spot whr th fight was going on.
Nicholas dismountd, and with Natásha and Ptya, who had riddn up,
stoppd nar th hounds, waiting to s how th mattr would nd. Out of
th bushs cam th huntsman who had bn fighting and rod toward
his young mastr, with th fox tid to his cruppr. Whil still at a
distanc h took off his cap and trid to spak rspctfully, but h was
pal and brathlss and his fac was angry. On of his ys was black,
but h probably was not vn awar of it.
“What has happnd?” askd Nicholas.
“A likly thing, killing a fox our dogs had huntd! And it was my gray
bitch that caught it! Go to law, indd!... H snatchs at th fox! I
gav him on with th fox. Hr it is on my saddl! Do you want a tast
of this?...” said th huntsman, pointing to his daggr and probably
imagining himslf still spaking to his fo.
Nicholas, not stopping to talk to th man, askd his sistr and Ptya
to wait for him and rod to th spot whr th nmy’s, Ilágin’s,
hunting party was.
Th victorious huntsman rod off to join th fild, and thr,
surroundd by inquiring sympathizrs, rcountd his xploits.
Th facts wr that Ilágin, with whom th Rostóvs had a quarrl and
wr at law, huntd ovr placs that blongd by custom to th Rostóvs,
and had now, as if purposly, snt his mn to th vry woods th
Rostóvs wr hunting and lt his man snatch a fox thir dogs had
chasd.
Nicholas, though h had nvr sn Ilágin, with his usual absnc
of modration in judgmnt, hatd him cordially from rports of his
arbitrarinss and violnc, and rgardd him as his bittrst fo. H
rod in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully
prpard to tak th most rsolut and dsprat stps to punish his
nmy.
Hardly had h passd an angl of th wood bfor a stout gntlman in
a bavr cap cam riding toward him on a handsom ravn-black hors,
accompanid by two hunt srvants.
Instad of an nmy, Nicholas found in Ilágin a statly and courtous
gntlman who was particularly anxious to mak th young count’s
acquaintanc. Having riddn up to Nicholas, Ilágin raisd his bavr
cap and said h much rgrttd what had occurrd and would hav th
man punishd who had allowd himslf to siz a fox huntd by somon
ls’s borzois. H hopd to bcom bttr acquaintd with th count
and invitd him to draw his covrt.
Natásha, afraid that hr brothr would do somthing dradful, had
followd him in som xcitmnt. Sing th nmis xchanging frindly
grtings, sh rod up to thm. Ilágin liftd his bavr cap still
highr to Natásha and said, with a plasant smil, that th young
countss rsmbld Diana in hr passion for th chas as wll as in hr
bauty, of which h had hard much.
To xpiat his huntsman’s offns, Ilágin prssd th Rostóvs to
com to an upland of his about a mil away which h usually kpt for
himslf and which, h said, swarmd with hars. Nicholas agrd, and th
hunt, now doubld, movd on.
Th way to Iligin’s upland was across th filds. Th hunt srvants
fll into lin. Th mastrs rod togthr. “Uncl,” Rostóv, and
Ilágin kpt stalthily glancing at on anothr’s dogs, trying not
to b obsrvd by thir companions and sarching unasily for rivals to
thir own borzois.
Rostóv was particularly struck by th bauty of a small, pur-brd,
rd-spottd bitch on Ilágin’s lash, slndr but with muscls lik
stl, a dlicat muzzl, and prominnt black ys. H had hard of
th swiftnss of Ilágin’s borzois, and in that bautiful bitch saw a
rival to his own Mílka.
In th middl of a sobr convrsation bgun by Ilágin about th
yar’s harvst, Nicholas pointd to th rd-spottd bitch.
“A fin littl bitch, that!” said h in a carlss ton. “Is sh
swift?”
“That on? Ys, sh’s a good dog, gts what sh’s aftr,”
answrd Ilágin indiffrntly, of th rd-spottd bitch rzá, for
which, a yar bfor, h had givn a nighbor thr familis of hous
srfs. “So in your parts, too, th harvst is nothing to boast of,
Count?” h wnt on, continuing th convrsation thy had bgun. And
considring it polit to rturn th young count’s complimnt, Ilágin
lookd at his borzois and pickd out Mílka who attractd his attntion
by hr bradth. “That black-spottd on of yours is fin—wll
shapd!” said h.
“Ys, sh’s fast nough,” rplid Nicholas, and thought: “If
only a full-grown har would cross th fild now I’d show you what
sort of borzoi sh is,” and turning to his groom, h said h would
giv a rubl to anyon who found a har.
“I don’t undrstand,” continud Ilágin, “how som sportsmn can
b so jalous about gam and dogs. For myslf, I can tll you, Count,
I njoy riding in company such as this... what could b bttr?” (h
again raisd his cap to Natásha) “but as for counting skins and what
on taks, I don’t car about that.”
“Of cours not!”
“Or bing upst bcaus somon ls’s borzoi and not min catchs
somthing. All I car about is to njoy sing th chas, is it not so,
Count? For I considr that...”
“A-tu!” cam th long-drawn cry of on of th borzoi whipprs-in,
who had haltd. H stood on a knoll in th stubbl, holding his whip
aloft, and again rpatd his long-drawn cry, “A-tu!” (This call and
th upliftd whip mant that h saw a sitting har.)
“Ah, h has found on, I think,” said Ilágin carlssly. “Ys, w
must rid up.... Shall w both cours it?” answrd Nicholas, sing
in rzá and “Uncl’s” rd Rugáy two rivals h had nvr yt had
a chanc of pitting against his own borzois. “And suppos thy outdo
my Mílka at onc!” h thought as h rod with “Uncl” and Ilágin
toward th har.
“A full-grown on?” askd Ilágin as h approachd th whip who
had sightd th har—and not without agitation h lookd round and
whistld to rzá.
“And you, Michal Nikanórovich?” h said, addrssing “Uncl.”
Th lattr was riding with a sulln xprssion on his fac.
“How can I join in? Why, you’v givn a villag for ach of your
borzois! That’s it, com on! Yours ar worth thousands. Try yours
against on anothr, you two, and I’ll look on!”
“Rugáy, hy, hy!” h shoutd. “Rugáyushka!” h addd,
involuntarily by this diminutiv xprssing his affction and th hops
h placd on this rd borzoi. Natásha saw and flt th agitation th
two ldrly mn and hr brothr wr trying to concal, and was hrslf
xcitd by it.
Th huntsman stood halfway up th knoll holding up his whip and th
gntlfolk rod up to him at a footpac; th hounds that wr far off
on th horizon turnd away from th har, and th whips, but not th
gntlfolk, also movd away. All wr moving slowly and sdatly.
“How is it pointing?” askd Nicholas, riding a hundrd pacs toward
th whip who had sightd th har.
But bfor th whip could rply, th har, scnting th frost coming
nxt morning, was unabl to rst and lapd up. Th pack on lash rushd
downhill in full cry aftr th har, and from all sids th borzois that
wr not on lash dartd aftr th hounds and th har. All th hunt,
who had bn moving slowly, shoutd, “Stop!” calling in th hounds,
whil th borzoi whips, with a cry of “A-tu!” gallopd across th
fild stting th borzois on th har. Th tranquil Ilágin, Nicholas,
Natásha, and “Uncl” flw, rcklss of whr and how thy wnt,
sing only th borzois and th har and faring only to los sight vn
for an instant of th chas. Th har thy had startd was a strong and
swift on. Whn h jumpd up h did not run at onc, but prickd his
ars listning to th shouting and trampling that rsoundd from all
sids at onc. H took a dozn bounds, not vry quickly, ltting th
borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosn his dirction and
ralizd his dangr, laid back his ars and rushd off hadlong. H had
bn lying in th stubbl, but in front of him was th autumn sowing
whr th ground was soft. Th two borzois of th huntsman who had
sightd him, having bn th narst, wr th first to s and pursu
him, but thy had not gon far bfor Ilágin’s rd-spottd rzá
passd thm, got within a lngth, flw at th har with trribl
swiftnss aiming at his scut, and, thinking sh had sizd him, rolld
ovr lik a ball. Th har archd his back and boundd off yt mor
swiftly. From bhind rzá rushd th broad-haunchd, black-spottd
Mílka and bgan rapidly gaining on th har.
“Miláshka, dar!” ros Nicholas’ triumphant cry. It lookd as if
Mílka would immdiatly pounc on th har, but sh ovrtook him and
flw past. Th har had squattd. Again th bautiful rzá rachd him,
but whn clos to th har’s scut pausd as if masuring th distanc,
so as not to mak a mistak this tim but siz his hind lg.
“rzá, darling!” Ilágin waild in a voic unlik his own. rzá
did not harkn to his appal. At th vry momnt whn sh would hav
sizd hr pry, th har movd and dartd along th balk btwn th
wintr ry and th stubbl. Again rzá and Mílka wr abrast, running
lik a pair of carriag horss, and bgan to ovrtak th har, but
it was asir for th har to run on th balk and th borzois did not
ovrtak him so quickly.
“Rugáy, Rugáyushka! That’s it, com on!” cam a third voic just
thn, and “Uncl’s” rd borzoi, straining and curving its back,
caught up with th two formost borzois, pushd ahad of thm rgardlss
of th trribl strain, put on spd clos to th har, knockd it off
th balk onto th ryfild, again put on spd still mor viciously,
sinking to his kns in th muddy fild, and all on could s was
how, muddying his back, h rolld ovr with th har. A ring of borzois
surroundd him. A momnt latr vryon had drawn up round th crowd
of dogs. Only th dlightd “Uncl” dismountd, and cut off a pad,
shaking th har for th blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round
with rstlss ys whil his arms and lgs twitchd. H spok without
himslf knowing whom to or what about. “That’s it, com on! That’s
a dog!... Thr, it has batn thm all, th thousand-rubl as wll as
th on-rubl borzois. That’s it, com on!” said h, panting and
looking wrathfully around as if h wr abusing somon, as if thy
wr all his nmis and had insultd him, and only now had h at
last succdd in justifying himslf. “Thr ar your thousand-rubl
ons.... That’s it, com on!...”
“Rugáy, hr’s a pad for you!” h said, throwing down th
har’s muddy pad. “You’v dsrvd it, that’s it, com on!”
“Sh’d tird hrslf out, sh’d run it down thr tims by
hrslf,” said Nicholas, also not listning to anyon and rgardlss
of whthr h wr hard or not.
“But what is thr in running across it lik that?” said Ilágin’s
groom.
“Onc sh had missd it and turnd it away, any mongrl could tak
it,” Ilágin was saying at th sam tim, brathlss from his gallop
and his xcitmnt. At th sam momnt Natásha, without drawing
brath, scramd joyously, cstatically, and so pircingly that it st
vryon’s ar tingling. By that shrik sh xprssd what th othrs
xprssd by all talking at onc, and it was so strang that sh must
hrslf hav bn ashamd of so wild a cry and vryon ls would hav
bn amazd at it at any othr tim. “Uncl” himslf twistd up th
har, thrw it natly and smartly across his hors’s back as if by
that gstur h mant to rbuk vrybody, and, with an air of not
wishing to spak to anyon, mountd his bay and rod off. Th othrs all
followd, dispiritd and shamfacd, and only much latr wr thy abl
to rgain thir formr affctation of indiffrnc. For a long tim thy
continud to look at rd Rugáy who, his archd back spattrd with
mud and clanking th ring of his lash, walkd along just bhind
“Uncl’s” hors with th srn air of a conquror.
“Wll, I am lik any othr dog as long as it’s not a qustion of
coursing. But whn it is, thn look out!” his apparanc smd to
Nicholas to b saying.
Whn, much latr, “Uncl” rod up to Nicholas and bgan talking
to him, h flt flattrd that, aftr what had happnd, “Uncl”
dignd to spak to him.
CHAPTR VII
Toward vning Ilágin took lav of Nicholas, who found that thy wr
so far from hom that h accptd “Uncl’s” offr that th hunting
party should spnd th night in his littl villag of Mikháylovna.
“And if you put up at my hous that will b bttr still. That’s it,
com on!” said “Uncl.” “You s it’s damp wathr, and you
could rst, and th littl countss could b drivn hom in a trap.”
“Uncl’s” offr was accptd. A huntsman was snt to Otrádno for
a trap, whil Nicholas rod with Natásha and Ptya to “Uncl’s”
hous.
Som fiv mal domstic srfs, big and littl, rushd out to th front
porch to mt thir mastr. A scor of womn srfs, old and young, as
wll as childrn, poppd out from th back ntranc to hav a look at
th huntrs who wr arriving. Th prsnc of Natásha—a woman, a
lady, and on horsback—raisd th curiosity of th srfs to such a
dgr that many of thm cam up to hr, stard hr in th fac, and
unabashd by hr prsnc mad rmarks about hr as though sh wr som
prodigy on show and not a human bing abl to har or undrstand what
was said about hr.
“Arínka! Look, sh sits sidways! Thr sh sits and hr skirt
dangls.... S, sh’s got a littl hunting horn!”
“Goodnss gracious! S hr knif?...”
“Isn’t sh a Tartar!”
“How is it you didn’t go had ovr hls?” askd th boldst of
all, addrssing Natásha dirctly.
“Uncl” dismountd at th porch of his littl woodn hous which
stood in th midst of an ovrgrown gardn and, aftr a glanc at his
rtainrs, shoutd authoritativly that th suprfluous ons should tak
thmslvs off and that all ncssary prparations should b mad to
rciv th gusts and th visitors.
Th srfs all disprsd. “Uncl” liftd Natásha off hr hors and
taking hr hand ld hr up th rickty woodn stps of th porch. Th
hous, with its bar, unplastrd log walls, was not ovrclan—it
did not sm that thos living in it aimd at kping it spotlss—but
nithr was it noticably nglctd. In th ntry thr was a smll of
frsh appls, and wolf and fox skins hung about.
“Uncl” ld th visitors through th antroom into a small hall with
a folding tabl and rd chairs, thn into th drawing room with a round
birchwood tabl and a sofa, and finally into his privat room whr
thr was a tattrd sofa, a worn carpt, and portraits of Suvórov, of
th host’s fathr and mothr, and of himslf in military uniform. Th
study smlt strongly of tobacco and dogs. “Uncl” askd his visitors
to sit down and mak thmslvs at hom, and thn wnt out of th room.
Rugáy, his back still muddy, cam into th room and lay down on th
sofa, claning himslf with his tongu and tth. Lading from th study
was a passag in which a partition with raggd curtains could b
sn. From bhind this cam womn’s laughtr and whisprs. Natásha,
Nicholas, and Ptya took off thir wraps and sat down on th sofa.
Ptya, laning on his lbow, fll aslp at onc. Natásha and Nicholas
wr silnt. Thir facs glowd, thy wr hungry and vry chrful.
Thy lookd at on anothr (now that th hunt was ovr and thy wr in
th hous, Nicholas no longr considrd it ncssary to show his manly
supriority ovr his sistr), Natásha gav him a wink, and nithr
rfraind long from bursting into a pal of ringing laughtr vn bfor
thy had a prtxt rady to account for it.
Aftr a whil “Uncl” cam in, in a Cossack coat, blu trousrs, and
small top boots. And Natásha flt that this costum, th vry on sh
had rgardd with surpris and amusmnt at Otrádno, was just th
right thing and not at all wors than a swallow-tail or frock coat.
“Uncl” too was in high spirits and far from bing offndd by th
brothr’s and sistr’s laughtr (it could nvr ntr his had that
thy might b laughing at his way of lif) h himslf joind in th
mrrimnt.
“That’s right, young countss, that’s it, com on! I nvr saw
anyon lik hr!” said h, offring Nicholas a pip with a long stm
and, with a practicd motion of thr fingrs, taking down anothr that
had bn cut short. “Sh’s riddn all day lik a man, and is as
frsh as vr!”
Soon aftr “Uncl’s” rapparanc th door was opnd, vidntly
from th sound by a barfootd girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking
woman of about forty, with a doubl chin and full rd lips, ntrd
carrying a larg loadd tray. With hospitabl dignity and cordiality in
hr glanc and in vry motion, sh lookd at th visitors and, with
a plasant smil, bowd rspctfully. In spit of hr xcptional
stoutnss, which causd hr to protrud hr chst and stomach and throw
back hr had, this woman (who was “Uncl’s” houskpr) trod
vry lightly. Sh wnt to th tabl, st down th tray, and with hr
plump whit hands dftly took from it th bottls and various hors
d’ouvrs and dishs and arrangd thm on th tabl. Whn sh had
finishd, sh stppd asid and stoppd at th door with a smil on hr
fac. “Hr I am. I am sh! Now do you undrstand ‘Uncl’?” hr
xprssion said to Rostóv. How could on hlp undrstanding? Not only
Nicholas, but vn Natásha undrstood th maning of his puckrd brow
and th happy complacnt smil that slightly puckrd his lips whn
Anísya Fëdorovna ntrd. On th tray was a bottl of hrb win,
diffrnt kinds of vodka, pickld mushrooms, ry caks mad with
buttrmilk, hony in th comb, still mad and sparkling mad, appls,
nuts (raw and roastd), and nut-and-hony swts. Aftrwards sh brought
a frshly roastd chickn, ham, prsrvs mad with hony, and prsrvs
mad with sugar.
All this was th fruit of Anísya Fëdorovna’s houskping, gathrd
and prpard by hr. Th smll and tast of it all had a smack
of Anísya Fëdorovna hrslf: a savor of juicinss, clanlinss,
whitnss, and plasant smils.
“Tak this, littl Lady-Countss!” sh kpt saying, as sh offrd
Natásha first on thing and thn anothr.
Natásha at of vrything and thought sh had nvr sn or atn such
buttrmilk caks, such aromatic jam, such hony-and-nut swts, or such
a chickn anywhr. Anísya Fëdorovna lft th room.
Aftr suppr, ovr thir chrry brandy, Rostóv and “Uncl” talkd
of past and futur hunts, of Rugáy and Ilágin’s dogs, whil Natásha
sat upright on th sofa and listnd with sparkling ys. Sh trid
svral tims to wak Ptya that h might at somthing, but h
only muttrd incohrnt words without waking up. Natásha flt so
lighthartd and happy in ths novl surroundings that sh only fard
th trap would com for hr too soon. Aftr a casual paus, such as
oftn occurs whn rciving frinds for th first tim in on’s own
hous, “Uncl,” answring a thought that was in his visitors’
minds, said:
“This, you s, is how I am finishing my days... Dath will com.
That’s it, com on! Nothing will rmain. Thn why harm anyon?”
“Uncl’s” fac was vry significant and vn handsom as h said
this. Involuntarily Rostóv rcalld all th good h had hard about
him from his fathr and th nighbors. Throughout th whol provinc
“Uncl” had th rputation of bing th most honorabl and
disintrstd of cranks. Thy calld him in to dcid family disputs,
chos him as xcutor, confidd scrts to him, lctd him to b a
justic and to othr posts; but h always prsistntly rfusd public
appointmnts, passing th autumn and spring in th filds on his bay
glding, sitting at hom in wintr, and lying in his ovrgrown gardn in
summr.
“Why don’t you ntr th srvic, Uncl?”
“I did onc, but gav it up. I am not fit for it. That’s it, com
on! I can’t mak had or tail of it. That’s for you—I havn’t
brains nough. Now, hunting is anothr mattr—that’s it, com on!
Opn th door, thr!” h shoutd. “Why hav you shut it?”
Th door at th nd of th passag ld to th huntsmn’s room, as thy
calld th room for th hunt srvants.
Thr was a rapid pattr of bar ft, and an unsn hand opnd th
door into th huntsmn’s room, from which cam th clar sounds of a
balaláyka on which somon, who was vidntly a mastr of th art, was
playing. Natásha had bn listning to thos strains for som tim and
now wnt out into th passag to har bttr.
“That’s Mítka, my coachman.... I hav got him a good balaláyka.
I’m fond of it,” said “Uncl.”
It was th custom for Mítka to play th balaláyka in th huntsmn’s
room whn “Uncl” rturnd from th chas. “Uncl” was fond of
such music.
“How good! Rally vry good!” said Nicholas with som unintntional
suprciliousnss, as if ashamd to confss that th sounds plasd him
vry much.
“Vry good?” said Natásha rproachfully, noticing hr brothr’s
ton. “Not ‘vry good’ it’s simply dlicious!”
Just as “Uncl’s” pickld mushrooms, hony, and chrry brandy had
smd to hr th bst in th world, so also that song, at that momnt,
smd to hr th acm of musical dlight.
“Mor, plas, mor!” crid Natásha at th door as soon as th
balaláyka casd. Mítka tund up afrsh, and rcommncd thrumming
th balaláyka to th air of My Lady, with trills and variations.
“Uncl” sat listning, slightly smiling, with his had on on sid.
Th air was rpatd a hundrd tims. Th balaláyka was rtund svral
tims and th sam nots wr thrummd again, but th listnrs did
not grow wary of it and wishd to har it again and again. Anísya
Fëdorovna cam in and land hr portly prson against th doorpost.
“You lik listning?” sh said to Natásha, with a smil xtrmly
lik “Uncl’s.” “That’s a good playr of ours,” sh addd.
“H dosn’t play that part right!” said “Uncl” suddnly, with
an nrgtic gstur. “Hr h ought to burst out—that’s it, com
on!—ought to burst out.”
“Do you play thn?” askd Natásha.
“Uncl” did not answr, but smild.
“Anísya, go and s if th strings of my guitar ar all right. I
havn’t touchd it for a long tim. That’s it—com on! I’v
givn it up.”
Anísya Fëdorovna, with hr light stp, willingly wnt to fulfill hr
rrand and brought back th guitar.
Without looking at anyon, “Uncl” blw th dust off it and, tapping
th cas with his bony fingrs, tund th guitar and sttld himslf in
his armchair. H took th guitar a littl abov th fingrboard, arching
his lft lbow with a somwhat thatrical gstur, and, with a wink at
Anísya Fëdorovna, struck a singl chord, pur and sonorous, and thn
quitly, smoothly, and confidntly bgan playing in vry slow tim, not
My Lady, but th wll-known song: Cam a maidn down th strt. Th
tun, playd with prcision and in xact tim, bgan to thrill in th
harts of Nicholas and Natásha, arousing in thm th sam kind of
sobr mirth as radiatd from Anísya Fëdorovna’s whol bing. Anísya
Fëdorovna flushd, and drawing hr krchif ovr hr fac wnt laughing
out of th room. “Uncl” continud to play corrctly, carfully,
with nrgtic firmnss, looking with a changd and inspird xprssion
at th spot whr Anísya Fëdorovna had just stood. Somthing smd to
b laughing a littl on on sid of his fac undr his gray mustachs,
spcially as th song grw briskr and th tim quickr and whn, hr
and thr, as h ran his fingrs ovr th strings, somthing smd to
snap.
“Lovly, lovly! Go on, Uncl, go on!” shoutd Natásha as soon as
h had finishd. Sh jumpd up and huggd and kissd him. “Nicholas,
Nicholas!” sh said, turning to hr brothr, as if asking him: “What
is it movs m so?”
Nicholas too was gratly plasd by “Uncl’s” playing, and
“Uncl” playd th pic ovr again. Anísya Fëdorovna’s smiling
fac rappard in th doorway and bhind hrs othr facs...
    Ftching watr clar and swt,
    Stop, dar maidn, I ntrat—
playd “Uncl” onc mor, running his fingrs skillfully ovr th
strings, and thn h stoppd short and jrkd his shouldrs.
“Go on, Uncl dar,” Natásha waild in an imploring ton as if hr
lif dpndd on it.
“Uncl” ros, and it was as if thr wr two mn in him: on of
thm smild sriously at th mrry fllow, whil th mrry fllow struck
a naïv and prcis attitud prparatory to a folk danc.
“Now thn, nic!” h xclaimd, waving to Natásha th hand that
had just struck a chord.
Natásha thrw off th shawl from hr shouldrs, ran forward to fac
“Uncl,” and stting hr arms akimbo also mad a motion with hr
shouldrs and struck an attitud.
Whr, how, and whn had this young countss, ducatd by an migr
Frnch govrnss, imbibd from th Russian air sh brathd that spirit
and obtaind that mannr which th pas d châl * would, on would hav
supposd, long ago hav ffacd? But th spirit and th movmnts wr
thos inimitabl and untachabl Russian ons that “Uncl” had
xpctd of hr. As soon as sh had struck hr pos, and smild
triumphantly, proudly, and with sly mrrimnt, th far that had at
first sizd Nicholas and th othrs that sh might not do th right
thing was at an nd, and thy wr alrady admiring hr.
    * Th Frnch shawl danc.
Sh did th right thing with such prcision, such complt prcision,
that Anísya Fëdorovna, who had at onc handd hr th handkrchif sh
ndd for th danc, had tars in hr ys, though sh laughd as sh
watchd this slim, gracful countss, rard in silks and vlvts and so
diffrnt from hrslf, who yt was abl to undrstand all that was
in Anísya and in Anísya’s fathr and mothr and aunt, and in vry
Russian man and woman.
“Wll, littl countss; that’s it—com on!” crid “Uncl,”
with a joyous laugh, having finishd th danc. “Wll don, nic! Now
a fin young fllow must b found as husband for you. That’s it—com
on!”
“H’s chosn alrady,” said Nicholas smiling.
“Oh?” said “Uncl” in surpris, looking inquiringly at Natásha,
who noddd hr had with a happy smil.
“And such a on!” sh said. But as soon as sh had said it a nw
train of thoughts and flings aros in hr. “What did Nicholas’
smil man whn h said ‘chosn alrady’? Is h glad of it or not?
It is as if h thought my Bolkónski would not approv of or undrstand
our gaity. But h would undrstand it all. Whr is h now?” sh
thought, and hr fac suddnly bcam srious. But this lastd only a
scond. “Don’t dar to think about it,” sh said to hrslf,
and sat down again smilingly bsid “Uncl,” bgging him to play
somthing mor.
“Uncl” playd anothr song and a vals; thn aftr a paus h
clard his throat and sang his favorit hunting song:
    As ‘twas growing dark last night
    Fll th snow so soft and light...
“Uncl” sang as pasants sing, with full and naïv conviction that
th whol maning of a song lis in th words and that th tun coms
of itslf, and that apart from th words thr is no tun, which xists
only to giv masur to th words. As a rsult of this th unconsidrd
tun, lik th song of a bird, was xtraordinarily good. Natásha was in
cstasis ovr “Uncl’s” singing. Sh rsolvd to giv up larning
th harp and to play only th guitar. Sh askd “Uncl” for his
guitar and at onc found th chords of th song.
Aftr nin o’clock two traps and thr mountd mn, who had bn snt
to look for thm, arrivd to ftch Natásha and Ptya. Th count and
countss did not know whr thy wr and wr vry anxious, said on of
th mn.
Ptya was carrid out lik a log and laid in th largr of th two
traps. Natásha and Nicholas got into th othr. “Uncl” wrappd
Natásha up warmly and took lav of hr with quit a nw tndrnss. H
accompanid thm on foot as far as th bridg that could not b crossd,
so that thy had to go round by th ford, and h snt huntsmn to rid
in front with lantrns.
“Good-by, dar nic,” his voic calld out of th darknss—not
th voic Natásha had known prviously, but th on that had sung As
‘twas growing dark last night.
In th villag through which thy passd thr wr rd lights and a
chrful smll of smok.
“What a darling Uncl is!” said Natásha, whn thy had com out
onto th highroad.
“Ys,” rturnd Nicholas. “You’r not cold?”
“No. I’m quit, quit all right. I fl so comfortabl!” answrd
Natásha, almost prplxd by hr flings. Thy rmaind silnt a long
whil. Th night was dark and damp. Thy could not s th horss, but
only hard thm splashing through th unsn mud.
What was passing in that rcptiv childlik soul that so agrly caught
and assimilatd all th divrs imprssions of lif? How did thy all
find plac in hr? But sh was vry happy. As thy wr naring hom sh
suddnly struck up th air of As ‘twas growing dark last night—th
tun of which sh had all th way bn trying to gt and had at last
caught.
“Got it?” said Nicholas.
“What wr you thinking about just now, Nicholas?” inquird
Natásha.
Thy wr fond of asking on anothr that qustion.
“I?” said Nicholas, trying to rmmbr. “Wll, you s, first I
thought that Rugáy, th rd hound, was lik Uncl, and that if h wr
a man h would always kp Uncl nar him, if not for his riding, thn
for his mannr. What a good fllow Uncl is! Don’t you think so?...
Wll, and you?”
“I? Wait a bit, wait.... Ys, first I thought that w ar driving
along and imagining that w ar going hom, but that havn knows
whr w ar rally going in th darknss, and that w shall arriv and
suddnly find that w ar not in Otrádno, but in Fairyland. And thn I
thought... No, nothing ls.”
“I know, I xpct you thought of him,” said Nicholas, smiling as
Natásha knw by th sound of his voic.
“No,” said Natásha, though sh had in rality bn thinking about
Princ Andrw at th sam tim as of th rst, and of how h would
hav likd “Uncl.” “And thn I was saying to myslf all th way,
‘How wll Anísya carrid hrslf, how wll!’” And Nicholas hard
hr spontanous, happy, ringing laughtr. “And do you know,” sh
suddnly said, “I know that I shall nvr again b as happy and
tranquil as I am now.”
“Rubbish, nonsns, humbug!” xclaimd Nicholas, and h thought:
“How charming this Natásha of min is! I hav no othr frind lik
hr and nvr shall hav. Why should sh marry? W might always driv
about togthr!”
“What a darling this Nicholas of min is!” thought Natásha.
“Ah, thr ar still lights in th drawing room!” sh said, pointing
to th windows of th hous that glamd invitingly in th moist vlvty
darknss of th night.
CHAPTR VIII
Count Ilyá Rostóv had rsignd th position of Marshal of th Nobility
bcaus it involvd him in too much xpns, but still his affairs
did not improv. Natásha and Nicholas oftn noticd thir parnts
confrring togthr anxiously and privatly and hard suggstions of
slling th fin ancstral Rostóv hous and stat nar Moscow. It was
not ncssary to ntrtain so frly as whn th count had bn Marshal,
and lif at Otrádno was quitr than in formr yars, but still th
normous hous and its lodgs wr full of popl and mor than twnty
sat down to tabl vry day. Ths wr all thir own popl who had
sttld down in th hous almost as mmbrs of th family, or prsons
who wr, it smd, obligd to liv in th count’s hous. Such wr
Dimmlr th musician and his wif, Vogl th dancing mastr and his
family, Blóva, an old maidn lady, an inmat of th hous, and many
othrs such as Ptya’s tutors, th girls’ formr govrnss, and
othr popl who simply found it prfrabl and mor advantagous to
liv in th count’s hous than at hom. Thy had not as many visitors
as bfor, but th old habits of lif without which th count and
countss could not conciv of xistnc rmaind unchangd. Thr was
still th hunting stablishmnt which Nicholas had vn nlargd, th
sam fifty horss and fiftn grooms in th stabls, th sam xpnsiv
prsnts and dinnr partis to th whol district on nam days; thr
wr still th count’s gams of whist and boston, at which—sprading
out his cards so that vrybody could s thm—h lt himslf b
plundrd of hundrds of rubls vry day by his nighbors, who lookd
upon an opportunity to play a rubbr with Count Rostóv as a most
profitabl sourc of incom.
Th count movd in his affairs as in a hug nt, trying not to bliv
that h was ntangld but bcoming mor and mor so at vry stp, and
fling too fbl to brak th mshs or to st to work carfully and
patintly to disntangl thm. Th countss, with hr loving hart, flt
that hr childrn wr bing ruind, that it was not th count’s fault
for h could not hlp bing what h was—that (though h trid to
hid it) h himslf suffrd from th consciousnss of his own and
his childrn’s ruin, and sh trid to find mans of rmdying th
position. From hr fminin point of viw sh could s only on
solution, namly, for Nicholas to marry a rich hirss. Sh flt this to
b thir last hop and that if Nicholas rfusd th match sh had found
for him, sh would hav to abandon th hop of vr gtting mattrs
right. This match was with Juli Karágina, th daughtr of xcllnt
and virtuous parnts, a girl th Rostóvs had known from childhood, and
who had now bcom a walthy hirss through th dath of th last of
hr brothrs.
Th countss had writtn dirct to Juli’s mothr in Moscow suggsting
a marriag btwn thir childrn and had rcivd a favorabl answr
from hr. Karágina had rplid that for hr part sh was agrabl, and
vrything dpnd on hr daughtr’s inclination. Sh invitd Nicholas
to com to Moscow.
Svral tims th countss, with tars in hr ys, told hr son that
now both hr daughtrs wr sttld, hr only wish was to s him
marrid. Sh said sh could li down in hr grav pacfully if that
wr accomplishd. Thn sh told him that sh knw of a splndid girl
and trid to discovr what h thought about marriag.
At othr tims sh praisd Juli to him and advisd him to go to
Moscow during th holidays to amus himslf. Nicholas gussd what his
mothr’s rmarks wr lading to and during on of ths convrsations
inducd hr to spak quit frankly. Sh told him that hr only hop
of gtting thir affairs disntangld now lay in his marrying Juli
Karágina.
“But, Mamma, suppos I lovd a girl who has no fortun, would
you xpct m to sacrific my flings and my honor for th sak of
mony?” h askd his mothr, not ralizing th crulty of his qustion
and only wishing to show his nobl-minddnss.
“No, you hav not undrstood m,” said his mothr, not knowing how
to justify hrslf. “You hav not undrstood m, Nikólnka. It is
your happinss I wish for,” sh addd, fling that sh was tlling an
untruth and was bcoming ntangld. Sh bgan to cry.
“Mamma, don’t cry! Only tll m that you wish it, and you know I
will giv my lif, anything, to put you at as,” said Nicholas. “I
would sacrific anything for you—vn my flings.”
But th countss did not want th qustion put lik that: sh did not
want a sacrific from hr son, sh hrslf wishd to mak a sacrific
for him.
“No, you hav not undrstood m, don’t lt us talk about it,” sh
rplid, wiping away hr tars.
“Mayb I do lov a poor girl,” said Nicholas to himslf. “Am I to
sacrific my flings and my honor for mony? I wondr how Mamma could
spak so to m. Bcaus Sónya is poor I must not lov hr,” h
thought, “must not rspond to hr faithful, dvotd lov? Yt I should
crtainly b happir with hr than with som doll-lik Juli. I can
always sacrific my flings for my family’s wlfar,” h said to
himslf, “but I can’t corc my flings. If I lov Sónya, that
fling is for m strongr and highr than all ls.”
Nicholas did not go to Moscow, and th countss did not rnw th
convrsation with him about marriag. Sh saw with sorrow, and somtims
with xaspration, symptoms of a growing attachmnt btwn hr son and
th portionlss Sónya. Though sh blamd hrslf for it, sh could
not rfrain from grumbling at and worrying Sónya, oftn pulling hr up
without rason, addrssing hr stiffly as “my dar,” and using th
formal “you” instad of th intimat “thou” in spaking to hr.
Th kindhartd countss was th mor vxd with Sónya bcaus that
poor, dark-yd nic of hrs was so mk, so kind, so dvotdly
gratful to hr bnfactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and
unslfishly in lov with Nicholas, that thr wr no grounds for
finding fault with hr.
Nicholas was spnding th last of his lav at hom. A fourth lttr had
com from Princ Andrw, from Rom, in which h wrot that h would hav
bn on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unxpctdly
ropnd in th warm climat, which obligd him to dfr his rturn till
th bginning of th nw yar. Natásha was still as much in lov with
hr btrothd, found th sam comfort in that lov, and was still as
rady to throw hrslf into all th plasurs of lif as bfor; but at
th nd of th fourth month of thir sparation sh bgan to hav fits
of dprssion which sh could not mastr. Sh flt sorry for hrslf:
sorry that sh was bing wastd all this tim and of no us to

CHAPTR IX
Christmas cam and xcpt for th crmonial Mass, th solmn and
warisom Christmas congratulations from nighbors and srvants, and th
nw drsss vryon put on, thr wr no spcial fstivitis, though
th calm frost of twnty dgrs Raumur, th dazzling sunshin by day,
and th starlight of th wintr nights smd to call for som spcial
clbration of th sason.
On th third day of Christmas wk, aftr th midday dinnr, all th
inmats of th hous disprsd to various rooms. It was th dullst tim
of th day. Nicholas, who had bn visiting som nighbors that morning,
was aslp on th sitting-room sofa. Th old count was rsting in his
study. Sónya sat in th drawing room at th round tabl, copying a
dsign for mbroidry. Th countss was playing patinc. Nastásya
Ivánovna th buffoon sat with a sad fac at th window with two old
ladis. Natásha cam into th room, wnt up to Sónya, glancd at
what sh was doing, and thn wnt up to hr mothr and stood without
spaking.
“Why ar you wandring about lik an outcast?” askd hr mothr.
“What do you want?”
“Him... I want him... now, this minut! I want him!” said Natásha,
with glittring ys and no sign of a smil.
Th countss liftd hr had and lookd attntivly at hr daughtr.
“Don’t look at m, Mamma! Don’t look; I shall cry dirctly.”
“Sit down with m a littl,” said th countss.
“Mamma, I want him. Why should I b wastd lik this, Mamma?”
Hr voic brok, tars gushd from hr ys, and sh turnd quickly to
hid thm and lft th room.
Sh passd into th sitting room, stood thr thinking awhil, and thn
wnt into th maids’ room. Thr an old maidsrvant was grumbling at
a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through th cold from
th srfs’ quartrs.
“Stop playing—thr’s a tim for vrything,” said th old
woman.
“Lt hr alon, Kondrátvna,” said Natásha. “Go, Mavrúshka,
go.”
Having rlasd Mavrúshka, Natásha crossd th dancing hall and wnt
to th vstibul. Thr an old footman and two young ons wr playing
cards. Thy brok off and ros as sh ntrd.
“What can I do with thm?” thought Natásha.
“Oh, Nikíta, plas go... whr can I snd him?... Ys, go to th
yard and ftch a fowl, plas, a cock, and you, Misha, bring m som
oats.”
“Just a fw oats?” said Misha, chrfully and radily.
“Go, go quickly,” th old man urgd him.
“And you, Thodor, gt m a pic of chalk.”
On hr way past th butlr’s pantry sh told thm to st a samovar,
though it was not at all th tim for ta.
Fóka, th butlr, was th most ill-tmprd prson in th hous.
Natásha likd to tst hr powr ovr him. H distrustd th ordr and
askd whthr th samovar was rally wantd.
“Oh dar, what a young lady!” said Fóka, prtnding to frown at
Natásha.
No on in th hous snt popl about or gav thm as much troubl as
Natásha did. Sh could not s popl unconcrndly, but had to snd
thm on som rrand. Sh smd to b trying whthr any of thm would
gt angry or sulky with hr; but th srfs fulfilld no on’s ordrs
so radily as thy did hrs. “What can I do, whr can I go?”
thought sh, as sh wnt slowly along th passag.
“Nastásya Ivánovna, what sort of childrn shall I hav?” sh askd
th buffoon, who was coming toward hr in a woman’s jackt.
“Why, flas, crickts, grasshopprs,” answrd th buffoon.
“O Lord, O Lord, it’s always th sam! Oh, whr am I to go? What
am I to do with myslf?” And tapping with hr hls, sh ran quickly
upstairs to s Vogl and his wif who livd on th uppr story.
Two govrnsss wr sitting with th Vogls at a tabl, on which wr
plats of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. Th govrnsss wr discussing
whthr it was chapr to liv in Moscow or Odssa. Natásha sat down,
listnd to thir talk with a srious and thoughtful air, and thn got
up again.
“Th island of Madagascar,” sh said, “Ma-da-gas-car,” sh
rpatd, articulating ach syllabl distinctly, and, not rplying to
Madam Schoss who askd hr what sh was saying, sh wnt out of th
room.
Hr brothr Ptya was upstairs too; with th man in attndanc on him
h was prparing firworks to lt off that night.
“Ptya! Ptya!” sh calld to him. “Carry m downstairs.”
Ptya ran up and offrd hr his back. Sh jumpd on it, putting hr
arms round his nck, and h prancd along with hr.
“No, don’t... th island of Madagascar!” sh said, and jumping off
his back sh wnt downstairs.
Having as it wr rviwd hr kingdom, tstd hr powr, and mad
sur that vryon was submissiv, but that all th sam it was dull,
Natásha btook hrslf to th ballroom, pickd up hr guitar, sat down
in a dark cornr bhind a bookcas, and bgan to run hr fingrs ovr
th strings in th bass, picking out a passag sh rcalld from an
opra sh had hard in Ptrsburg with Princ Andrw. What sh drw from
th guitar would hav had no maning for othr listnrs, but in hr
imagination a whol sris of rminiscncs aros from thos sounds.
Sh sat bhind th bookcas with hr ys fixd on a strak of light
scaping from th pantry door and listnd to hrslf and pondrd. Sh
was in a mood for brooding on th past.
Sónya passd to th pantry with a glass in hr hand. Natásha glancd
at hr and at th crack in th pantry door, and it smd to hr that
sh rmmbrd th light falling through that crack onc bfor and
Sónya passing with a glass in hr hand. “Ys it was xactly th
sam,” thought Natásha.
“Sónya, what is this?” sh crid, twanging a thick string.
“Oh, you ar thr!” said Sónya with a start, and cam nar and
listnd. “I don’t know. A storm?” sh vnturd timidly, afraid of
bing wrong.
“Thr! That’s just how sh startd and just how sh cam up smiling
timidly whn all this happnd bfor,” thought Natásha, “and in
just th sam way I thought thr was somthing lacking in hr.”
“No, it’s th chorus from Th Watr-Carrir, listn!” and Natásha
sang th air of th chorus so that Sónya should catch it. “Whr wr
you going?” sh askd.
“To chang th watr in this glass. I am just finishing th dsign.”
“You always find somthing to do, but I can’t,” said Natásha.
“And whr’s Nicholas?”
“Aslp, I think.”
“Sónya, go and wak him,” said Natásha. “Tll him I want him to
com and sing.”
Sh sat awhil, wondring what th maning of it all having happnd
bfor could b, and without solving this problm, or at all rgrtting
not having don so, sh again passd in fancy to th tim whn sh was
with him and h was looking at hr with a lovr’s ys.
“Oh, if only h would com quickr! I am so afraid it will nvr b!
And, worst of all, I am growing old—that’s th thing! Thr won’t
thn b in m what thr is now. But prhaps h’ll com today, will
com immdiatly. Prhaps h has com and is sitting in th drawing
room. Prhaps h cam ystrday and I hav forgottn it.” Sh ros,
put down th guitar, and wnt to th drawing room.
All th domstic circl, tutors, govrnsss, and gusts, wr alrady
at th ta tabl. Th srvants stood round th tabl—but Princ Andrw
was not thr and lif was going on as bfor.
“Ah, hr sh is!” said th old count, whn h saw Natásha ntr.
“Wll, sit down by m.” But Natásha stayd by hr mothr and
glancd round as if looking for somthing.
“Mamma!” sh muttrd, “giv him to m, giv him, Mamma, quickly,
quickly!” and sh again had difficulty in rprssing hr sobs.
Sh sat down at th tabl and listnd to th convrsation btwn th
ldrs and Nicholas, who had also com to th tabl. “My God, my God!
Th sam facs, th sam talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in th
sam way!” thought Natásha, fling with horror a sns of rpulsion
rising up in hr for th whol houshold, bcaus thy wr always th
sam.
Aftr ta, Nicholas, Sónya, and Natásha wnt to th sitting room, to
thir favorit cornr whr thir most intimat talks always bgan.
CHAPTR X
“Dos it vr happn to you,” said Natásha to hr brothr, whn
thy sttld down in th sitting room, “dos it vr happn to you to
fl as if thr wr nothing mor to com—nothing; that vrything
good is past? And to fl not xactly dull, but sad?”
“I should think so!” h rplid. “I hav flt lik that whn
vrything was all right and vryon was chrful. Th thought has com
into my mind that I was alrady tird of it all, and that w must all
di. Onc in th rgimnt I had not gon to som mrrymaking whr thr
was music... and suddnly I flt so dprssd...”
“Oh ys, I know, I know, I know!” Natásha intrruptd him. “Whn
I was quit littl that usd to b so with m. Do you rmmbr whn
I was punishd onc about som plums? You wr all dancing, and I sat
sobbing in th schoolroom? I shall nvr forgt it: I flt sad and sorry
for vryon, for myslf, and for vryon. And I was innocnt—that
was th chif thing,” said Natásha. “Do you rmmbr?”
“I rmmbr,” answrd Nicholas. “I rmmbr that I cam to you
aftrwards and wantd to comfort you, but do you know, I flt ashamd
to. W wr trribly absurd. I had a funny doll thn and wantd to giv
it to you. Do you rmmbr?”
“And do you rmmbr,” Natásha askd with a pnsiv smil, “how
onc, long, long ago, whn w wr quit littl, Uncl calld us into
th study—that was in th old hous—and it was dark—w wnt in and
suddnly thr stood...”
“A Ngro,” chimd in Nicholas with a smil of dlight. “Of cours
I rmmbr. vn now I don’t know whthr thr rally was a Ngro, or
if w only dramd it or wr told about him.”
“H was gray, you rmmbr, and had whit tth, and stood and lookd
at us....”
“Sónya, do you rmmbr?” askd Nicholas.
“Ys, ys, I do rmmbr somthing too,” Sónya answrd timidly.
“You know I hav askd Papa and Mamma about that Ngro,” said
Natásha, “and thy say thr was no Ngro at all. But you s, you
rmmbr!”
“Of cours I do, I rmmbr his tth as if I had just sn thm.”
“How strang it is! It’s as if it wr a dram! I lik that.”
“And do you rmmbr how w rolld hard-boild ggs in th ballroom,
and suddnly two old womn bgan spinning round on th carpt? Was that
ral or not? Do you rmmbr what fun it was?”
“Ys, and you rmmbr how Papa in his blu ovrcoat fird a gun in
th porch?”
So thy wnt through thir mmoris, smiling with plasur: not th sad
mmoris of old ag, but potic, youthful ons—thos imprssions of
on’s most distant past in which drams and ralitis blnd—and thy
laughd with quit njoymnt.
Sónya, as always, did not quit kp pac with thm, though thy shard
th sam rminiscncs.
Much that thy rmmbrd had slippd from hr mind, and what sh
rcalld did not arous th sam potic fling as thy xprincd. Sh
simply njoyd thir plasur and trid to fit in with it.
Sh only rally took part whn thy rcalld Sónya’s first arrival.
Sh told thm how afraid sh had bn of Nicholas bcaus h had on a
cordd jackt and hr nurs had told hr that sh, too, would b swn up
with cords.
“And I rmmbr thir tlling m that you had bn born undr a
cabbag,” said Natásha, “and I rmmbr that I dard not disbliv
it thn, but knw that it was not tru, and I flt so uncomfortabl.”
Whil thy wr talking a maid thrust hr had in at th othr door of
th sitting room.
“Thy hav brought th cock, Miss,” sh said in a whispr.
“It isn’t wantd, Pólya. Tll thm to tak it away,” rplid
Natásha.
In th middl of thir talk in th sitting room, Dimmlr cam in and
wnt up to th harp that stood thr in a cornr. H took off its cloth
covring, and th harp gav out a jarring sound.
“Mr. Dimmlr, plas play my favorit nocturn by Fild,” cam th
old countss’ voic from th drawing room.
Dimmlr struck a chord and, turning to Natásha, Nicholas, and Sónya,
rmarkd: “How quit you young popl ar!”
“Ys, w’r philosophizing,” said Natásha, glancing round for a
momnt and thn continuing th convrsation. Thy wr now discussing
drams.
Dimmlr bgan to play; Natásha wnt on tipto noislssly to th tabl,
took up a candl, carrid it out, and rturnd, sating hrslf quitly
in hr formr plac. It was dark in th room spcially whr thy wr
sitting on th sofa, but through th big windows th silvry light of
th full moon fll on th floor. Dimmlr had finishd th pic but
still sat softly running his fingrs ovr th strings, vidntly
uncrtain whthr to stop or to play somthing ls.
“Do you know,” said Natásha in a whispr, moving closr to Nicholas
and Sónya, “that whn on gos on and on rcalling mmoris, on at
last bgins to rmmbr what happnd bfor on was in th world....”
“That is mtmpsychosis,” said Sónya, who had always larnd wll,
and rmmbrd vrything. “Th gyptians blivd that our souls hav
livd in animals, and will go back into animals again.”
“No, I don’t bliv w vr wr in animals,” said Natásha,
still in a whispr though th music had casd. “But I am crtain that
w wr angls somwhr thr, and hav bn hr, and that is why w
rmmbr....”
“May I join you?” said Dimmlr who had com up quitly, and h sat
down by thm.
“If w hav bn angls, why hav w falln lowr?” said Nicholas.
“No, that can’t b!”
“Not lowr, who said w wr lowr?... How do I know what I
was bfor?” Natásha rjoind with conviction. “Th soul is
immortal—wll thn, if I shall always liv I must hav livd bfor,
livd for a whol trnity.”
“Ys, but it is hard for us to imagin trnity,” rmarkd Dimmlr,
who had joind th young folk with a mildly condscnding smil but now
spok as quitly and sriously as thy.
“Why is it hard to imagin trnity?” said Natásha. “It is now
today, and it will b tomorrow, and always; and thr was ystrday, and
th day bfor....”
“Natásha! Now it’s your turn. Sing m somthing,” thy hard th
countss say. “Why ar you sitting thr lik conspirators?”
“Mamma, I don’t at all want to,” rplid Natásha, but all th
sam sh ros.
Non of thm, not vn th middl-agd Dimmlr, wantd to brak off
thir convrsation and quit that cornr in th sitting room, but
Natásha got up and Nicholas sat down at th clavichord. Standing
as usual in th middl of th hall and choosing th plac whr th
rsonanc was bst, Natásha bgan to sing hr mothr’s favorit song.
Sh had said sh did not want to sing, but it was long sinc sh had
sung, and long bfor sh again sang, as sh did that vning. Th
count, from his study whr h was talking to Mítnka, hard hr and,
lik a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundrd in his talk
whil giving ordrs to th stward, and at last stoppd, whil Mítnka
stood in front of him also listning and smiling. Nicholas did not tak
his ys off his sistr and drw brath in tim with hr. Sónya, as sh
listnd, thought of th immns diffrnc thr was btwn hrslf
and hr frind, and how impossibl it was for hr to b anything lik as
bwitching as hr cousin. Th old countss sat with a blissful yt sad
smil and with tars in hr ys, occasionally shaking hr had. Sh
thought of Natásha and of hr own youth, and of how thr was somthing
unnatural and dradful in this impnding marriag of Natásha and Princ
Andrw.
Dimmlr, who had satd himslf bsid th countss, listnd with
closd ys.
“Ah, Countss,” h said at last, “that’s a uropan talnt, sh
has nothing to larn—what softnss, tndrnss, and strngth....”
“Ah, how afraid I am for hr, how afraid I am!” said th countss,
not ralizing to whom sh was spaking. Hr matrnal instinct told hr
that Natásha had too much of somthing, and that bcaus of this
sh would not b happy. Bfor Natásha had finishd singing,
fourtn-yar-old Ptya rushd in dlightdly, to say that som mummrs
had arrivd.
Natásha stoppd abruptly.
“Idiot!” sh scramd at hr brothr and, running to a chair, thrw
hrslf on it, sobbing so violntly that sh could not stop for a long
tim.
“It’s nothing, Mamma, rally it’s nothing; only Ptya startld
m,” sh said, trying to smil, but hr tars still flowd and sobs
still chokd hr.
Th mummrs (som of th hous srfs) drssd up as bars, Turks,
innkprs, and ladis—frightning and funny—bringing in with
thm th cold from outsid and a fling of gaity, crowdd, at first
timidly, into th antroom, thn hiding bhind on anothr thy pushd
into th ballroom whr, shyly at first and thn mor and mor mrrily
and hartily, thy startd singing, dancing, and playing Christmas
gams. Th countss, whn sh had idntifid thm and laughd at thir
costums, wnt into th drawing room. Th count sat in th ballroom,
smiling radiantly and applauding th playrs. Th young popl had
disappard.
Half an hour latr thr appard among th othr mummrs in th
ballroom an old lady in a hoopd skirt—this was Nicholas. A Turkish
girl was Ptya. A clown was Dimmlr. An hussar was Natásha, and a
Circassian was Sónya with burnt-cork mustach and ybrows.
Aftr th condscnding surpris, nonrcognition, and prais, from thos
who wr not thmslvs drssd up, th young popl dcidd that thir
costums wr so good that thy ought to b shown lswhr.
Nicholas, who, as th roads wr in splndid condition, wantd to tak
thm all for a driv in his troyka, proposd to tak with thm about a
dozn of th srf mummrs and driv to “Uncl’s.”
“No, why disturb th old fllow?” said th countss. “Bsids,
you wouldn’t hav room to turn round thr. If you must go, go to th
Mlyukóvs’.”
Mlyukóva was a widow, who, with hr family and thir tutors and
govrnsss, livd thr mils from th Rostóvs.
“That’s right, my dar,” chimd in th old count, thoroughly
arousd. “I’ll drss up at onc and go with thm. I’ll mak
Pashtt opn hr ys.”
But th countss would not agr to his going; h had had a bad lg all
ths last days. It was dcidd that th count must not go, but that if
Louisa Ivánovna (Madam Schoss) would go with thm, th young ladis
might go to th Mlyukóvs’, Sónya, gnrally so timid and shy, mor
urgntly than anyon bgging Louisa Ivánovna not to rfus.
Sónya’s costum was th bst of all. Hr mustach and ybrows wr
xtraordinarily bcoming. vryon told hr sh lookd vry handsom,
and sh was in a spiritd and nrgtic mood unusual with hr. Som
innr voic told hr that now or nvr hr fat would b dcidd, and
in hr mal attir sh smd quit a diffrnt prson. Louisa Ivánovna
consntd to go, and in half an hour four troyka slighs with larg and
small blls, thir runnrs squaking and whistling ovr th frozn snow,
drov up to th porch.
Natásha was formost in stting a mrry holiday ton, which, passing
from on to anothr, grw strongr and rachd its climax whn thy all
cam out into th frost and got into th slighs, talking, calling to
on anothr, laughing, and shouting.
Two of th troykas wr th usual houshold slighs, th third was th
old count’s with a trottr from th Orlóv stud as shaft hors,
th fourth was Nicholas’ own with a short shaggy black shaft hors.
Nicholas, in his old lady’s drss ovr which h had bltd his hussar
ovrcoat, stood in th middl of th sligh, rins in hand.
It was so light that h could s th moonlight rflctd from th mtal
harnss disks and from th ys of th horss, who lookd round in alarm
at th noisy party undr th shadow of th porch roof.
Natásha, Sónya, Madam Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas’
sligh; Dimmlr, his wif, and Ptya, into th old count’s, and th
rst of th mummrs satd thmslvs in th othr two slighs.
“You go ahad, Zakhár!” shoutd Nicholas to his fathr’s
coachman, wishing for a chanc to rac past him.
Th old count’s troyka, with Dimmlr and his party, startd forward,
squaking on its runnrs as though frzing to th snow, its dp-tond
bll clanging. Th sid horss, prssing against th shafts of th
middl hors, sank in th snow, which was dry and glittrd lik sugar,
and thrw it up.
Nicholas st off, following th first sligh; bhind him th othrs
movd noisily, thir runnrs squaking. At first thy drov at a stady
trot along th narrow road. Whil thy drov past th gardn th shadows
of th bar trs oftn fll across th road and hid th brilliant
moonlight, but as soon as thy wr past th fnc, th snowy plain
bathd in moonlight and motionlss sprad out bfor thm glittring
lik diamonds and dappld with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! wnt th
first sligh ovr a cradl hol in th snow of th road, and ach of
th othr slighs joltd in th sam way, and rudly braking th
frost-bound stillnss, th troykas bgan to spd along th road, on
aftr th othr.
“A har’s track, a lot of tracks!” rang out Natásha’s voic
through th frost-bound air.
“How light it is, Nicholas!” cam Sónya’s voic.
Nicholas glancd round at Sónya, and bnt down to s hr fac closr.
Quit a nw, swt fac with black ybrows and mustachs ppd up
at him from hr sabl furs—so clos and yt so distant—in th
moonlight.
“That usd to b Sónya,” thought h, and lookd at hr closr and
smild.
“What is it, Nicholas?”
“Nothing,” said h and turnd again to th horss.
Whn thy cam out onto th batn highroad—polishd by sligh runnrs
and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, th marks of which wr visibl in th
moonlight—th horss bgan to tug at th rins of thir own accord and
incrasd thir pac. Th nar sid hors, arching his had and braking
into a short cantr, tuggd at his tracs. Th shaft hors swayd from
sid to sid, moving his ars as if asking: “Isn’t it tim to bgin
now?” In front, alrady far ahad th dp bll of th sligh ringing
farthr and farthr off, th black horss drivn by Zakhár could b
clarly sn against th whit snow. From that sligh on could har th
shouts, laughtr, and voics of th mummrs.
“G up, my darlings!” shoutd Nicholas, pulling th rins to on
sid and flourishing th whip.
It was only by th knr wind that mt thm and th jrks givn by th
sid horss who pulld hardr—vr incrasing thir gallop—that
on noticd how fast th troyka was flying. Nicholas lookd back. With
scrams squals, and waving of whips that causd vn th shaft horss
to gallop—th othr slighs followd. Th shaft hors swung stadily
bnath th bow ovr its had, with no thought of slackning pac and
rady to put on spd whn rquird.
Nicholas ovrtook th first sligh. Thy wr driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad troddn track across a madow, nar a rivr.
“Whr ar w?” thought h. “It’s th Kosóy madow, I suppos.
But no—this is somthing nw I’v nvr sn bfor. This isn’t
th Kosóy madow nor th Dëmkin hill, and havn only knows what it
is! It is somthing nw and nchantd. Wll, whatvr it may b...”
And shouting to his horss, h bgan to pass th first sligh.
Zakhár hld back his horss and turnd his fac, which was alrady
covrd with hoarfrost to his ybrows.
Nicholas gav th horss th rin, and Zakhár, strtching out his arms,
cluckd his tongu and lt his horss go.
“Now, look out, mastr!” h crid.
Fastr still th two troykas flw sid by sid, and fastr movd
th ft of th galloping sid horss. Nicholas bgan to draw ahad.
Zakhár, whil still kping his arms xtndd, raisd on hand with th
rins.
“No you won’t, mastr!” h shoutd.
Nicholas put all his horss to a gallop and passd Zakhár. Th horss
showrd th fin dry snow on th facs of thos in th sligh—bsid
thm soundd quick ringing blls and thy caught confusd glimpss of
swiftly moving lgs and th shadows of th troyka thy wr passing.
Th whistling sound of th runnrs on th snow and th voics of girls
shriking wr hard from diffrnt sids.
Again chcking his horss, Nicholas lookd around him. Thy wr still
surroundd by th magic plain bathd in moonlight and spangld with
stars.
“Zakhár is shouting that I should turn to th lft, but why to th
lft?” thought Nicholas. “Ar w gtting to th Mlyukóvs’? Is
this Mlyukóvka? Havn only knows whr w ar going, and havn knows
what is happning to us—but it is vry strang and plasant whatvr
it is.” And h lookd round in th sligh.
“Look, his mustach and ylashs ar all whit!” said on of th
strang, prtty, unfamiliar popl—th on with fin ybrows and
mustach.
“I think this usd to b Natásha,” thought Nicholas, “and that
was Madam Schoss, but prhaps it’s not, and this Circassian with th
mustach I don’t know, but I lov hr.”
“Arn’t you cold?” h askd.
Thy did not answr but bgan to laugh. Dimmlr from th sligh bhind
shoutd somthing—probably somthing funny—but thy could not mak
out what h said.
“Ys, ys!” som voics answrd, laughing.
“But hr was a fairy forst with black moving shadows, and a glittr
of diamonds and a flight of marbl stps and th silvr roofs of fairy
buildings and th shrill ylls of som animals. And if this is rally
Mlyukóvka, it is still strangr that w drov havn knows whr and
hav com to Mlyukóvka,” thought Nicholas.
It rally was Mlyukóvka, and maids and footmn with mrry facs cam
running, out to th porch carrying candls.
“Who is it?” askd somon in th porch.
“Th mummrs from th count’s. I know by th horss,” rplid som
voics.
CHAPTR XI
Plagya Danílovna Mlyukóva, a broadly built, nrgtic woman
waring spctacls, sat in th drawing room in a loos drss, surroundd
by hr daughtrs whom sh was trying to kp from fling dull. Thy
wr quitly dropping mltd wax into snow and looking at th shadows
th wax figurs would throw on th wall, whn thy hard th stps and
voics of nw arrivals in th vstibul.
Hussars, ladis, witchs, clowns, and bars, aftr claring thir
throats and wiping th hoarfrost from thir facs in th vstibul,
cam into th ballroom whr candls wr hurridly lightd. Th
clown—Dimmlr—and th lady—Nicholas—startd a danc. Surroundd
by th scraming childrn th mummrs, covring thir facs and
disguising thir voics, bowd to thir hostss and arrangd thmslvs
about th room.
“Dar m! thr’s no rcognizing thm! And Natásha! S whom
sh looks lik! Sh rally rminds m of sombody. But Hrr
Dimmlr—isn’t h good! I didn’t know him! And how h dancs. Dar
m, thr’s a Circassian. Rally, how bcoming it is to dar Sónya.
And who is that? Wll, you hav chrd us up! Nikíta and Vanya—clar
away th tabls! And w wr sitting so quitly. Ha, ha, ha!... Th
hussar, th hussar! Just lik a boy! And th lgs!... I can’t look at
him...” diffrnt voics wr saying.
Natásha, th young Mlyukóvs’ favorit, disappard with thm into
th back rooms whr a cork and various drssing gowns and mal garmnts
wr calld for and rcivd from th footman by bar girlish arms from
bhind th door. Tn minuts latr, all th young Mlyukóvs joind th
mummrs.
Plagya Danílovna, having givn ordrs to clar th rooms for th
visitors and arrangd about rfrshmnts for th gntry and th srfs,
wnt about among th mummrs without rmoving hr spctacls, pring
into thir facs with a supprssd smil and failing to rcogniz any
of thm. It was not mrly Dimmlr and th Rostóvs sh faild to
rcogniz, sh did not vn rcogniz hr own daughtrs, or hr lat
husband’s, drssing gowns and uniforms, which thy had put on.
“And who is this?” sh askd hr govrnss, pring into th fac of
hr own daughtr drssd up as a Kazán-Tartar. “I suppos it is on
of th Rostóvs! Wll, Mr. Hussar, and what rgimnt do you srv in?”
sh askd Natásha. “Hr, hand som fruit jlly to th Turk!”
sh ordrd th butlr who was handing things round. “That’s not
forbiddn by his law.”
Somtims, as sh lookd at th strang but amusing caprs cut by th
dancrs, who—having dcidd onc for all that bing disguisd, no on
would rcogniz thm—wr not at all shy, Plagya Danílovna hid
hr fac in hr handkrchif, and hr whol stout body shook with
irrprssibl, kindly, ldrly laughtr.
“My littl Sásha! Look at Sásha!” sh said.
Aftr Russian country dancs and chorus dancs, Plagya Danílovna
mad th srfs and gntry join in on larg circl: a ring, a string,
and a silvr rubl wr ftchd and thy all playd gams togthr.
In an hour, all th costums wr crumpld and disordrd. Th corkd
ybrows and mustachs wr smard ovr th prspiring, flushd,
and mrry facs. Plagya Danílovna bgan to rcogniz th mummrs,
admird thir clvrly contrivd costums, and particularly how thy
suitd th young ladis, and sh thankd thm all for having ntrtaind
hr so wll. Th visitors wr invitd to suppr in th drawing room,
and th srfs had somthing srvd to thm in th ballroom.
“Now to tll on’s fortun in th mpty bathhous is frightning!”
said an old maid who livd with th Mlyukóvs, during suppr.
“Why?” said th ldst Mlyukóv girl.
“You wouldn’t go, it taks courag....”
“I’ll go,” said Sónya.
“Tll what happnd to th young lady!” said th scond Mlyukóv
girl.
“Wll,” bgan th old maid, “a young lady onc wnt out, took a
cock, laid th tabl for two, all proprly, and sat down. Aftr sitting
a whil, sh suddnly hars somon coming... a sligh drivs up with
harnss blls; sh hars him coming! H coms in, just in th shap of a
man, lik an officr—coms in and sits down to tabl with hr.”
“Ah! ah!” scramd Natásha, rolling hr ys with horror.
“Ys? And how... did h spak?”
“Ys, lik a man. vrything quit all right, and h bgan prsuading
hr; and sh should hav kpt him talking till cockcrow, but sh got
frightnd, just got frightnd and hid hr fac in hr hands. Thn h
caught hr up. It was lucky th maids ran in just thn....”
“Now, why frightn thm?” said Plagya Danílovna.
“Mamma, you usd to try your fat yourslf...” said hr daughtr.
“And how dos on do it in a barn?” inquird Sónya.
“Wll, say you wnt to th barn now, and listnd. It dpnds on what
you har; hammring and knocking—that’s bad; but a sound of shifting
grain is good and on somtims hars that, too.”
“Mamma, tll us what happnd to you in th barn.”
Plagya Danílovna smild.
“Oh, I’v forgottn...” sh rplid. “But non of you would
go?”
“Ys, I will; Plagya Danílovna, lt m! I’ll go,” said Sónya.
“Wll, why not, if you’r not afraid?”
“Louisa Ivánovna, may I?” askd Sónya.
Whthr thy wr playing th ring and string gam or th rubl gam or
talking as now, Nicholas did not lav Sónya’s sid, and gazd at hr
with quit nw ys. It smd to him that it was only today, thanks
to that burnt-cork mustach, that h had fully larnd to know hr. And
rally, that vning, Sónya was brightr, mor animatd, and prttir
than Nicholas had vr sn hr bfor.
“So that’s what sh is lik; what a fool I hav bn!” h thought
gazing at hr sparkling ys, and undr th mustach a happy rapturous
smil dimpld hr chks, a smil h had nvr sn bfor.
“I’m not afraid of anything,” said Sónya. “May I go at onc?”
Sh got up.
Thy told hr whr th barn was and how sh should stand and listn,
and thy handd hr a fur cloak. Sh thrw this ovr hr had and
shouldrs and glancd at Nicholas.
“What a darling that girl is!” thought h. “And what hav I bn
thinking of till now?”
Sónya wnt out into th passag to go to th barn. Nicholas wnt
hastily to th front porch, saying h flt too hot. Th crowd of popl
rally had mad th hous stuffy.
Outsid, thr was th sam cold stillnss and th sam moon, but vn
brightr than bfor. Th light was so strong and th snow sparkld with
so many stars that on did not wish to look up at th sky and th ral
stars wr unnoticd. Th sky was black and drary, whil th arth was
gay.
“I am a fool, a fool! what hav I bn waiting for?” thought
Nicholas, and running out from th porch h wnt round th cornr of
th hous and along th path that ld to th back porch. H knw Sónya
would pass that way. Halfway lay som snow-covrd pils of firwood and
across and along thm a ntwork of shadows from th bar old lim trs
fll on th snow and on th path. This path ld to th barn. Th log
walls of th barn and its snow-covrd roof, that lookd as if hwn out
of som prcious ston, sparkld in th moonlight. A tr in th gardn
snappd with th frost, and thn all was again prfctly silnt. His
bosom smd to inhal not air but th strngth of trnal youth and
gladnss.
From th back porch cam th sound of ft dscnding th stps, th
bottom stp upon which snow had falln gav a ringing crak and h hard
th voic of an old maidsrvant saying, “Straight, straight, along th
path, Miss. Only, don’t look back.”
“I am not afraid,” answrd Sónya’s voic, and along th path
toward Nicholas cam th crunching, whistling sound of Sónya’s ft
in hr thin shos.
Sónya cam along, wrappd in hr cloak. Sh was only a coupl of pacs
away whn sh saw him, and to hr too h was not th Nicholas sh had
known and always slightly fard. H was in a woman’s drss, with
tousld hair and a happy smil nw to Sónya. Sh ran rapidly toward
him.
“Quit diffrnt and yt th sam,” thought Nicholas, looking at hr
fac all lit up by th moonlight. H slippd his arms undr th cloak
that covrd hr had, mbracd hr, prssd hr to him, and kissd hr
on th lips that wor a mustach and had a smll of burnt cork. Sónya
kissd him full on th lips, and disngaging hr littl hands prssd
thm to his chks.
“Sónya!... Nicholas!”... was all thy said. Thy ran to th barn
and thn back again, r-ntring, h by th front and sh by th back
porch.
CHAPTR XII
Whn thy all drov back from Plagya Danílovna’s, Natásha, who
always saw and noticd vrything, arrangd that sh and Madam Schoss
should go back in th sligh with Dimmlr, and Sónya with Nicholas and
th maids.
On th way back Nicholas drov at a stady pac instad of racing and
kpt pring by that fantastic all-transforming light into Sónya’s
fac and sarching bnath th ybrows and mustach for his formr and
his prsnt Sónya from whom h had rsolvd nvr to b partd again.
H lookd and rcognizing in hr both th old and th nw Sónya, and
bing rmindd by th smll of burnt cork of th snsation of hr kiss,
inhald th frosty air with a full brast and, looking at th ground
flying bnath him and at th sparkling sky, flt himslf again in
fairyland.
“Sónya, is it wll with th?” h askd from tim to tim.
“Ys!” sh rplid. “And with th?”
Whn halfway hom Nicholas handd th rins to th coachman and ran for
a momnt to Natásha’s sligh and stood on its wing.
“Natásha!” h whisprd in Frnch, “do you know I hav mad up my
mind about Sónya?”
“Hav you told hr?” askd Natásha, suddnly baming all ovr with
joy.
“Oh, how strang you ar with that mustach and thos ybrows!...
Natásha—ar you glad?”
“I am so glad, so glad! I was bginning to b vxd with you. I did
not tll you, but you hav bn trating hr badly. What a hart sh
has, Nicholas! I am horrid somtims, but I was ashamd to b happy
whil Sónya was not,” continud Natásha. “Now I am so glad! Wll,
run back to hr.”
“No, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!” crid Nicholas, pring
into hr fac and finding in his sistr too somthing nw, unusual, and
bwitchingly tndr that h had not sn in hr bfor. “Natásha,
it’s magical, isn’t it?”
“Ys,” sh rplid. “You hav don splndidly.”
“Had I sn hr bfor as sh is now,” thought Nicholas, “I should
long ago hav askd hr what to do and hav don whatvr sh told m,
and all would hav bn wll.”
“So you ar glad and I hav don right?”
“Oh, quit right! I had a quarrl with Mamma som tim ago about it.
Mamma said sh was angling for you. How could sh say such a thing! I
narly stormd at Mamma. I will nvr lt anyon say anything bad of
Sónya, for thr is nothing but good in hr.”
“Thn it’s all right?” said Nicholas, again scrutinizing th
xprssion of his sistr’s fac to s if sh was in arnst. Thn h
jumpd down and, his boots scrunching th snow, ran back to his sligh.
Th sam happy, smiling Circassian, with mustach and baming ys
looking up from undr a sabl hood, was still sitting thr, and that
Circassian was Sónya, and that Sónya was crtainly his futur happy
and loving wif.
Whn thy rachd hom and had told thir mothr how thy had spnt th
vning at th Mlyukóvs’, th girls wnt to thir bdroom. Whn thy
had undrssd, but without washing off th cork mustachs, thy sat a
long tim talking of thir happinss. Thy talkd of how thy would liv
whn thy wr marrid, how thir husbands would b frinds, and how
happy thy would b. On Natásha’s tabl stood two looking glasss
which Dunyásha had prpard bforhand.
“Only whn will all that b? I am afraid nvr.... It would b too
good!” said Natásha, rising and going to th looking glasss.
“Sit down, Natásha; prhaps you’ll s him,” said Sónya.
Natásha lit th candls, on on ach sid of on of th looking
glasss, and sat down.
“I s somon with a mustach,” said Natásha, sing hr own fac.
“You mustn’t laugh, Miss,” said Dunyásha.
With Sónya’s hlp and th maid’s, Natásha got th glass sh hld
into th right position opposit th othr; hr fac assumd a srious
xprssion and sh sat silnt. Sh sat a long tim looking at th
rcding lin of candls rflctd in th glasss and xpcting (from
tals sh had hard) to s a coffin, or him, Princ Andrw, in that
last dim, indistinctly outlind squar. But rady as sh was to tak th
smallst spck for th imag of a man or of a coffin, sh saw nothing.
Sh bgan blinking rapidly and movd away from th looking glasss.
“Why is it othrs s things and I don’t?” sh said. “You sit
down now, Sónya. You absolutly must, tonight! Do it for m.... Today I
fl so frightnd!”
Sónya sat down bfor th glasss, got th right position, and bgan
looking.
“Now, Miss Sónya is sur to s somthing,” whisprd Dunyásha;
“whil you do nothing but laugh.”
Sónya hard this and Natásha’s whispr:
“I know sh will. Sh saw somthing last yar.”
For about thr minuts all wr silnt.
“Of cours sh will!” whisprd Natásha, but did not finish...
suddnly Sónya pushd away th glass sh was holding and covrd hr
ys with hr hand.
“Oh, Natásha!” sh crid.
“Did you s? Did you? What was it?” xclaimd Natásha, holding up
th looking glass.
Sónya had not sn anything, sh was just wanting to blink and to gt
up whn sh hard Natásha say, “Of cours sh will!” Sh did not
wish to disappoint ithr Dunyásha or Natásha, but it was hard to sit
still. Sh did not hrslf know how or why th xclamation scapd hr
whn sh covrd hr ys.
“You saw him?” urgd Natásha, sizing hr hand.
“Ys. Wait a bit... I... saw him,” Sónya could not hlp saying, not
yt knowing whom Natásha mant by him, Nicholas or Princ Andrw.
“But why shouldn’t I say I saw somthing? Othrs do s! Bsids who
can tll whthr I saw anything or not?” flashd through Sónya’s
mind.
“Ys, I saw him,” sh said.
“How? Standing or lying?”
“No, I saw... At first thr was nothing, thn I saw him lying
down.”
“Andrw lying? Is h ill?” askd Natásha, hr frightnd ys fixd
on hr frind.
“No, on th contrary, on th contrary! His fac was chrful, and h
turnd to m.” And whn saying this sh hrslf fancid sh had rally
sn what sh dscribd.
“Wll, and thn, Sónya?...”
“Aftr that, I could not mak out what thr was; somthing blu and
rd....”
“Sónya! Whn will h com back? Whn shall I s him! O, God, how
afraid I am for him and for myslf and about vrything!...” Natásha
bgan, and without rplying to Sónya’s words of comfort sh got into
bd, and long aftr hr candl was out lay opn-yd and motionlss,
gazing at th moonlight through th frosty windowpans.
CHAPTR XIII
Soon aftr th Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mothr of his lov
for Sónya and of his firm rsolv to marry hr. Th countss, who
had long noticd what was going on btwn thm and was xpcting this
dclaration, listnd to him in silnc and thn told hr son that h
might marry whom h plasd, but that nithr sh nor his fathr would
giv thir blssing to such a marriag. Nicholas, for th first tim,
flt that his mothr was displasd with him and that, dspit hr lov
for him, sh would not giv way. Coldly, without looking at hr son,
sh snt for hr husband and, whn h cam, trid brifly and coldly to
inform him of th facts, in hr son’s prsnc, but unabl to rstrain
hrslf sh burst into tars of vxation and lft th room. Th old
count bgan irrsolutly to admonish Nicholas and bg him to abandon his
purpos. Nicholas rplid that h could not go back on his word, and his
fathr, sighing and vidntly disconcrtd, vry soon bcam silnt and
wnt in to th countss. In all his ncountrs with his son, th count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wastd th
family fortun, and so h could not b angry with him for rfusing to
marry an hirss and choosing th dowrlss Sónya. On this occasion, h
was only mor vividly conscious of th fact that if his affairs had not
bn in disordr, no bttr wif for Nicholas than Sónya could hav
bn wishd for, and that no on but himslf with his Mítnka and
his uncomfortabl habits was to blam for th condition of th family
financs.
Th fathr and mothr did not spak of th mattr to thir son again,
but a fw days latr th countss snt for Sónya and, with a crulty
nithr of thm xpctd, rproachd hr nic for trying to catch
Nicholas and for ingratitud. Sónya listnd silntly with downcast
ys to th countss’ crul words, without undrstanding what
was rquird of hr. Sh was rady to sacrific vrything for hr
bnfactors. Slf-sacrific was hr most chrishd ida but in this cas
sh could not s what sh ought to sacrific, or for whom. Sh could
not hlp loving th countss and th whol Rostóv family, but nithr
could sh hlp loving Nicholas and knowing that his happinss dpndd
on that lov. Sh was silnt and sad and did not rply. Nicholas flt
th situation to b intolrabl and wnt to hav an xplanation with his
mothr. H first implord hr to forgiv him and Sónya and consnt to
thir marriag, thn h thratnd that if sh molstd Sónya h would
at onc marry hr scrtly.
Th countss, with a coldnss hr son had nvr sn in hr bfor,
rplid that h was of ag, that Princ Andrw was marrying without his
fathr’s consnt, and h could do th sam, but that sh would nvr
rciv that intrigur as hr daughtr.
xploding at th word intrigur, Nicholas, raising his voic, told
his mothr h had nvr xpctd hr to try to forc him to sll his
flings, but if that wr so, h would say for th last tim.... But h
had no tim to uttr th dcisiv word which th xprssion of his fac
causd his mothr to await with trror, and which would prhaps hav
forvr rmaind a crul mmory to thm both. H had not tim to say it,
for Natásha, with a pal and st fac, ntrd th room from th door
at which sh had bn listning.
“Nicholas, you ar talking nonsns! B quit, b quit, b quit, I
tll you!...” sh almost scramd, so as to drown his voic.
“Mamma darling, it’s not at all so... my poor, swt darling,” sh
said to hr mothr, who conscious that thy had bn on th brink of
a ruptur gazd at hr son with trror, but in th obstinacy and
xcitmnt of th conflict could not and would not giv way.
“Nicholas, I’ll xplain to you. Go away! Listn, Mamma darling,”
said Natásha.
Hr words wr incohrnt, but thy attaind th purpos at which sh
was aiming.
Th countss, sobbing havily, hid hr fac on hr daughtr’s brast,
whil Nicholas ros, clutching his had, and lft th room.
Natásha st to work to ffct a rconciliation, and so far succdd
that Nicholas rcivd a promis from his mothr that Sónya should not
b troubld, whil h on his sid promisd not to undrtak anything
without his parnts’ knowldg.
Firmly rsolvd, aftr putting his affairs in ordr in th rgimnt,
to rtir from th army and rturn and marry Sónya, Nicholas, srious,
sorrowful, and at varianc with his parnts, but, as it smd to him,
passionatly in lov, lft at th bginning of January to rjoin his
rgimnt.
Aftr Nicholas had gon things in th Rostóv houshold wr mor
dprssing than vr, and th countss fll ill from mntal agitation.
Sónya was unhappy at th sparation from Nicholas and still mor so on
account of th hostil ton th countss could not hlp adopting toward
hr. Th count was mor prturbd than vr by th condition of his
affairs, which calld for som dcisiv action. Thir town hous and
stat nar Moscow had invitably to b sold, and for this thy had to
go to Moscow. But th countss’ halth obligd thm to dlay thir
dpartur from day to day.
Natásha, who had born th first priod of sparation from hr
btrothd lightly and vn chrfully, now grw mor agitatd and
impatint vry day. Th thought that hr bst days, which sh would
hav mployd in loving him, wr bing vainly wastd, with no advantag
to anyon, tormntd hr incssantly. His lttrs for th most part
irritatd hr. It hurt hr to think that whil sh livd only in th
thought of him, h was living a ral lif, sing nw placs and nw
popl that intrstd him. Th mor intrsting his lttrs wr
th mor vxd sh flt. Hr lttrs to him, far from giving hr any
comfort, smd to hr a warisom and artificial obligation. Sh could
not writ, bcaus sh could not conciv th possibility of xprssing
sincrly in a lttr vn a thousandth part of what sh xprssd by
voic, smil, and glanc. Sh wrot to him formal, monotonous, and dry
lttrs, to which sh attachd no importanc hrslf, and in th rough
copis of which th countss corrctd hr mistaks in splling.
Thr was still no improvmnt in th countss’ halth, but it was
impossibl to dfr th journy to Moscow any longr. Natásha’s
troussau had to b ordrd and th hous sold. Morovr, Princ Andrw
was xpctd in Moscow, whr old Princ Bolkónski was spnding th
wintr, and Natásha flt sur h had alrady arrivd.
So th countss rmaind in th country, and th count, taking Sónya
and Natásha with him, wnt to Moscow at th nd of January.
BOOK IGHT: 1811 - 12
CHAPTR I
Aftr Princ Andrw’s ngagmnt to Natásha, Pirr without any
apparnt caus suddnly flt it impossibl to go on living as bfor.
Firmly convincd as h was of th truths rvald to him by his
bnfactor, and happy as h had bn in prfcting his innr man, to
which h had dvotd himslf with such ardor—all th zst of such a
lif vanishd aftr th ngagmnt of Andrw and Natásha and th dath
of Josph Alxvich, th nws of which rachd him almost at th sam
tim. Only th sklton of lif rmaind: his hous, a brilliant wif
who now njoyd th favors of a vry important prsonag, acquaintanc
with all Ptrsburg, and his court srvic with its dull formalitis.
And this lif suddnly smd to Pirr unxpctdly loathsom. H
casd kping a diary, avoidd th company of th Brothrs, bgan going
to th club again, drank a grat dal, and cam onc mor in touch
with th bachlor sts, lading such a lif that th Countss Hlèn
thought it ncssary to spak svrly to him about it. Pirr flt that
sh was right, and to avoid compromising hr wnt away to Moscow.
In Moscow as soon as h ntrd his hug hous in which th fadd and
fading princsss still livd, with its normous rtinu; as soon as,
driving through th town, h saw th Ibrian shrin with innumrabl
taprs burning bfor th goldn covrs of th icons, th Krmlin
Squar with its snow undisturbd by vhicls, th sligh drivrs and
hovls of th Sívtsv Vrazhók, thos old Moscovits who dsird
nothing, hurrid nowhr, and wr nding thir days lisurly; whn h
saw thos old Moscow ladis, th Moscow balls, and th nglish Club, h
flt himslf at hom in a quit havn. In Moscow h flt at pac, at
hom, warm and dirty as in an old drssing gown.
Moscow socity, from th old womn down to th childrn, rcivd Pirr
lik a long-xpctd gust whos plac was always rady awaiting him.
For Moscow socity Pirr was th nicst, kindst, most intllctual,
mrrist, and most magnanimous of cranks, a hdlss, gnial noblman of
th old Russian typ. His purs was always mpty bcaus it was opn to
vryon.
Bnfit prformancs, poor picturs, status, bnvolnt socitis,
gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinnrs, sprs, Frmasons,
churchs, and books—no on and nothing mt with a rfusal from him,
and had it not bn for two frinds who had borrowd larg sums from
him and takn him undr thir protction, h would hav givn vrything
away. Thr was nvr a dinnr or soir at th club without him. As
soon as h sank into his plac on th sofa aftr two bottls of Margaux
h was surroundd, and talking, disputing, and joking bgan. Whn thr
wr quarrls, his kindly smil and wll-timd jsts rconcild th
antagonists. Th Masonic dinnrs wr dull and drary whn h was not
thr.
Whn aftr a bachlor suppr h ros with his amiabl and kindly smil,
yilding to th ntratis of th fstiv company to driv off somwhr
with thm, shouts of dlight and triumph aros among th young mn.
At balls h dancd if a partnr was ndd. Young ladis, marrid and
unmarrid, likd him bcaus without making lov to any of thm, h was
qually amiabl to all, spcially aftr suppr. “Il st charmant; il
n’a pas d sx,” * thy said of him.
    * “H is charming; h has no sx.”
Pirr was on of thos rtird gntlmn-in-waiting of whom thr wr
hundrds good-humordly nding thir days in Moscow.
How horrifid h would hav bn svn yars bfor, whn h first
arrivd from abroad, had h bn told that thr was no nd for him
to sk or plan anything, that his rut had long bn shapd, trnally
prdtrmind, and that wriggl as h might, h would b what all in
his position wr. H could not hav blivd it! Had h not at on
tim longd with all his hart to stablish a rpublic in Russia;
thn himslf to b a Napolon; thn to b a philosophr; and thn
a stratgist and th conquror of Napolon? Had h not sn th
possibility of, and passionatly dsird, th rgnration of th sinful
human rac, and his own progrss to th highst dgr of prfction?
Had h not stablishd schools and hospitals and libratd his srfs?
But instad of all that—hr h was, th walthy husband of an
unfaithful wif, a rtird gntlman-in-waiting, fond of ating and
drinking and, as h unbuttond his waistcoat, of abusing th govrnmnt
a bit, a mmbr of th Moscow nglish Club, and a univrsal favorit in
Moscow socity. For a long tim h could not rconcil himslf to th
ida that h was on of thos sam rtird Moscow gntlmn-in-waiting
h had so dspisd svn yars bfor.
Somtims h consold himslf with th thought that h was only living
this lif tmporarily; but thn h was shockd by th thought of how
many, lik himslf, had ntrd that lif and that club tmporarily,
with all thir tth and hair, and had only lft it whn not a singl
tooth or hair rmaind.
In momnts of prid, whn h thought of his position it smd to
him that h was quit diffrnt and distinct from thos othr rtird
gntlmn-in-waiting h had formrly dspisd: thy wr mpty, stupid,
contntd fllows, satisfid with thir position, “whil I am still
discontntd and want to do somthing for mankind. But prhaps all ths
comrads of min struggld just lik m and sought somthing nw, a
path in lif of thir own, and lik m wr brought by forc of
circumstancs, socity, and rac—by that lmntal forc against which
man is powrlss—to th condition I am in,” said h to himslf in
momnts of humility; and aftr living som tim in Moscow h no longr
dspisd, but bgan to grow fond of, to rspct, and to pity his
comrads in dstiny, as h pitid himslf.
Pirr no longr suffrd momnts of dspair, hypochondria, and disgust
with lif, but th malady that had formrly found xprssion in such
acut attacks was drivn inwards and nvr lft him for a momnt.
“What for? Why? What is going on in th world?” h would ask himslf
in prplxity svral tims a day, involuntarily bginning to rflct
anw on th maning of th phnomna of lif; but knowing by xprinc
that thr wr no answrs to ths qustions h mad hast to turn away
from thm, and took up a book, or hurrid off to th club or to Apollón
Nikolávich’s, to xchang th gossip of th town.
“Hlèn, who has nvr card for anything but hr own body and
is on of th stupidst womn in th world,” thought Pirr, “is
rgardd by popl as th acm of intllignc and rfinmnt, and thy
pay homag to hr. Napolon Bonapart was dspisd by all as long as h
was grat, but now that h has bcom a wrtchd comdian th mpror
Francis wants to offr him his daughtr in an illgal marriag. Th
Spaniards, through th Catholic clrgy, offr prais to God for thir
victory ovr th Frnch on th fourtnth of Jun, and th Frnch,
also through th Catholic clrgy, offr prais bcaus on that sam
fourtnth of Jun thy dfatd th Spaniards. My brothr Masons swar
by th blood that thy ar rady to sacrific vrything for thir
nighbor, but thy do not giv a rubl ach to th collctions for th
poor, and thy intrigu, th Astraa Lodg against th Manna Skrs,
and fuss about an authntic Scotch carpt and a chartr that nobody
nds, and th maning of which th vry man who wrot it dos not
undrstand. W all profss th Christian law of forgivnss of injuris
and lov of our nighbors, th law in honor of which w hav built in
Moscow forty tims forty churchs—but ystrday a dsrtr was knoutd
to dath and a ministr of that sam law of lov and forgivnss, a
prist, gav th soldir a cross to kiss bfor his xcution.” So
thought Pirr, and th whol of this gnral dcption which vryon
accpts, accustomd as h was to it, astonishd him ach tim as if it
wr somthing nw. “I undrstand th dcption and confusion,” h
thought, “but how am I to tll thm all that I s? I hav trid, and
hav always found that thy too in th dpths of thir souls undrstand
it as I do, and only try not to s it. So it appars that it must
b so! But I—what is to bcom of m?” thought h. H had th
unfortunat capacity many mn, spcially Russians, hav of sing and
bliving in th possibility of goodnss and truth, but of sing th
vil and falshood of lif too clarly to b abl to tak a srious part
in it. vry sphr of work was connctd, in his ys, with vil and
dcption. Whatvr h trid to b, whatvr h ngagd in, th vil and
falshood of it rpulsd him and blockd vry path of activity. Yt h
had to liv and to find occupation. It was too dradful to b undr
th burdn of ths insolubl problms, so h abandond himslf to
any distraction in ordr to forgt thm. H frquntd vry kind of
socity, drank much, bought picturs, ngagd in building, and abov
all—rad.
H rad, and rad vrything that cam to hand. On coming hom, whil
his valts wr still taking off his things, h pickd up a book and
bgan to rad. From rading h passd to slping, from slping to
gossip in drawing rooms of th club, from gossip to carousals and womn;
from carousals back to gossip, rading, and win. Drinking bcam mor
and mor a physical and also a moral ncssity. Though th doctors
warnd him that with his corpulnc win was dangrous for him, h
drank a grat dal. H was only quit at as whn having pourd svral
glasss of win mchanically into his larg mouth h flt a plasant
warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fllows, and a
radinss to rspond suprficially to vry ida without probing it
dply. Only aftr mptying a bottl or two did h fl dimly that th
trribly tangld skin of lif which prviously had trrifid him was
not as dradful as h had thought. H was always conscious of som
aspct of that skin, as with a buzzing in his had aftr dinnr or
suppr h chattd or listnd to convrsation or rad. But undr th
influnc of win h said to himslf: “It dosn’t mattr. I’ll
gt it unravld. I hav a solution rady, but hav no tim now—I’ll
think it all out latr on!” But th latr on nvr cam.
In th morning, on an mpty stomach, all th old qustions appard as
insolubl and trribl as vr, and Pirr hastily pickd up a book, and
if anyon cam to s him h was glad.
Somtims h rmmbrd how h had hard that soldirs in war whn
ntrnchd undr th nmy’s fir, if thy hav nothing to do, try
hard to find som occupation th mor asily to bar th dangr. To
Pirr all mn smd lik thos soldirs, sking rfug from lif:
som in ambition, som in cards, som in framing laws, som in womn,
som in toys, som in horss, som in politics, som in sport, som
in win, and som in govrnmntal affairs. “Nothing is trivial, and
nothing is important, it’s all th sam—only to sav onslf from it
as bst on can,” thought Pirr. “Only not to s it, that dradful
it!”
CHAPTR II
At th bginning of wintr Princ Nicholas Bolkónski and his daughtr
movd to Moscow. At that tim nthusiasm for th mpror Alxandr’s
rgim had waknd and a patriotic and anti-Frnch tndncy prvaild
thr, and this, togthr with his past and his intllct and his
originality, at onc mad Princ Nicholas Bolkónski an objct of
particular rspct to th Moscovits and th cntr of th Moscow
opposition to th govrnmnt.
Th princ had agd vry much that yar. H showd markd signs of
snility by a tndncy to fall aslp, forgtfulnss of quit rcnt
vnts, rmmbranc of rmot ons, and th childish vanity with which
h accptd th rol of had of th Moscow opposition. In spit of this
th old man inspird in all his visitors alik a fling of rspctful
vnration—spcially of an vning whn h cam in to ta in his
old-fashiond coat and powdrd wig and, arousd by anyon, told his
abrupt storis of th past, or uttrd yt mor abrupt and scathing
criticisms of th prsnt. For thm all, that old-fashiond hous with
its gigantic mirrors, pr-Rvolution furnitur, powdrd footmn, and
th strn shrwd old man (himslf a rlic of th past cntury) with his
gntl daughtr and th prtty Frnchwoman who wr rvrntly dvotd
to him prsntd a majstic and agrabl spctacl. But th visitors
did not rflct that bsids th coupl of hours during which thy saw
thir host, thr wr also twnty-two hours in th day during which th
privat and intimat lif of th hous continud.
Lattrly that privat lif had bcom vry trying for Princss Mary.
Thr in Moscow sh was dprivd of hr gratst plasurs—talks with
th pilgrims and th solitud which rfrshd hr at Bald Hills—and
sh had non of th advantags and plasurs of city lif. Sh did not
go out into socity; vryon knw that hr fathr would not lt hr
go anywhr without him, and his failing halth prvntd his going out
himslf, so that sh was not invitd to dinnrs and vning partis. Sh
had quit abandond th hop of gtting marrid. Sh saw th coldnss
and malvolnc with which th old princ rcivd and dismissd th
young mn, possibl suitors, who somtims appard at thir hous. Sh
had no frinds: during this visit to Moscow sh had bn disappointd in
th two who had bn narst to hr. Madmoisll Bourinn, with whom
sh had nvr bn abl to b quit frank, had now bcom unplasant to
hr, and for various rasons Princss Mary avoidd hr. Juli, with whom
sh had corrspondd for th last fiv yars, was in Moscow, but provd
to b quit alin to hr whn thy mt. Just thn Juli, who by th
dath of hr brothrs had bcom on of th richst hirsss in Moscow,
was in th full whirl of socity plasurs. Sh was surroundd by young
mn who, sh fancid, had suddnly larnd to apprciat hr worth.
Juli was at that stag in th lif of a socity woman whn sh fls
that hr last chanc of marrying has com and that hr fat must b
dcidd now or nvr. On Thursdays Princss Mary rmmbrd with a
mournful smil that sh now had no on to writ to, sinc Juli—whos
prsnc gav hr no plasur was hr and thy mt vry wk. Lik th
old migr who dclind to marry th lady with whom h had spnt his
vnings for yars, sh rgrttd Juli’s prsnc and having no on
to writ to. In Moscow Princss Mary had no on to talk to, no on to
whom to confid hr sorrow, and much sorrow fll to hr lot just thn.
Th tim for Princ Andrw’s rturn and marriag was approaching, but
his rqust to hr to prpar his fathr for it had not bn carrid
out; in fact, it smd as if mattrs wr quit hoplss, for at vry
mntion of th young Countss Rostóva th old princ (who apart from
that was usually in a bad tmpr) lost control of himslf. Anothr
latly addd sorrow aros from th lssons sh gav hr six yar-old
nphw. To hr constrnation sh dtctd in hrslf in rlation to
littl Nicholas som symptoms of hr fathr’s irritability. Howvr
oftn sh told hrslf that sh must not gt irritabl whn taching hr
nphw, almost vry tim that, pointr in hand, sh sat down to show
him th Frnch alphabt, sh so longd to pour hr own knowldg quickly
and asily into th child—who was alrady afraid that Aunti might at
any momnt gt angry—that at his slightst inattntion sh trmbld,
bcam flustrd and hatd, raisd hr voic, and somtims pulld him
by th arm and put him in th cornr. Having put him in th cornr
sh would hrslf bgin to cry ovr hr crul, vil natur, and littl
Nicholas, following hr xampl, would sob, and without prmission would
lav his cornr, com to hr, pull hr wt hands from hr fac, and
comfort hr. But what distrssd th princss most of all was hr
fathr’s irritability, which was always dirctd against hr and had
of lat amountd to crulty. Had h forcd hr to prostrat hrslf to
th ground all night, had h batn hr or mad hr ftch wood or watr,
it would nvr hav ntrd hr mind to think hr position hard; but
this loving dspot—th mor crul bcaus h lovd hr and for that
rason tormntd himslf and hr—knw how not mrly to hurt and
humiliat hr dlibratly, but to show hr that sh was always to blam
for vrything. Of lat h had xhibitd a nw trait that tormntd
Princss Mary mor than anything ls; this was his vr-incrasing
intimacy with Madmoisll Bourinn. Th ida that at th first momnt
of rciving th nws of his son’s intntions had occurrd to him in
jst—that if Andrw got marrid h himslf would marry Bourinn—had
vidntly plasd him, and lattrly h had prsistntly, and as it
smd to Princss Mary mrly to offnd hr, shown spcial ndarmnts
to th companion and xprssd his dissatisfaction with his daughtr by
dmonstrations of lov of Bourinn.
On day in Moscow in Princss Mary’s prsnc (sh thought hr fathr
did it purposly whn sh was thr) th old princ kissd Madmoisll
Bourinn’s hand and, drawing hr to him, mbracd hr affctionatly.
Princss Mary flushd and ran out of th room. A fw minuts latr
Madmoisll Bourinn cam into Princss Mary’s room smiling and
making chrful rmarks in hr agrabl voic. Princss Mary hastily
wipd away hr tars, wnt rsolutly up to Madmoisll Bourinn,
and vidntly unconscious of what sh was doing bgan shouting in angry
hast at th Frnchwoman, hr voic braking: “It’s horribl, vil,
inhuman, to tak advantag of th waknss...” Sh did not finish.
“Lav my room,” sh xclaimd, and burst into sobs.
Nxt day th princ did not say a word to his daughtr, but sh noticd
that at dinnr h gav ordrs that Madmoisll Bourinn should b
srvd first. Aftr dinnr, whn th footman handd coff and from
habit bgan with th princss, th princ suddnly grw furious,
thrw his stick at Philip, and instantly gav instructions to hav him
conscriptd for th army.
“H dosn’t oby... I said it twic... and h dosn’t oby! Sh
is th first prson in this hous; sh’s my bst frind,” crid
th princ. “And if you allow yourslf,” h scramd in a fury,
addrssing Princss Mary for th first tim, “to forgt yourslf again
bfor hr as you dard to do ystrday, I will show you who is mastr
in this hous. Go! Don’t lt m st ys on you; bg hr pardon!”
Princss Mary askd Madmoisll Bourinn’s pardon, and also hr
fathr’s pardon for hrslf and for Philip th footman, who had bggd
for hr intrvntion.
At such momnts somthing lik a prid of sacrific gathrd in hr
soul. And suddnly that fathr whom sh had judgd would look for his
spctacls in hr prsnc, fumbling nar thm and not sing thm, or
would forgt somthing that had just occurrd, or tak a fals stp with
his failing lgs and turn to s if anyon had noticd his fblnss,
or, worst of all, at dinnr whn thr wr no visitors to xcit him
would suddnly fall aslp, ltting his napkin drop and his shaking
had sink ovr his plat. “H is old and fbl, and I dar to condmn
him!” sh thought at such momnts, with a fling of rvulsion against
hrslf.
CHAPTR III
In 1811 thr was living in Moscow a Frnch doctor—Mtivir—who had
rapidly bcom th fashion. H was normously tall, handsom, amiabl
as Frnchmn ar, and was, as all Moscow said, an xtraordinarily clvr
doctor. H was rcivd in th bst houss not mrly as a doctor, but
as an qual.
Princ Nicholas had always ridiculd mdicin, but lattrly on
Madmoisll Bourinn’s advic had allowd this doctor to visit him
and had grown accustomd to him. Mtivir cam to s th princ about
twic a wk.
On Dcmbr 6—St. Nicholas’ Day and th princ’s nam day—all
Moscow cam to th princ’s front door but h gav ordrs to admit no
on and to invit to dinnr only a small numbr, a list of whom h gav
to Princss Mary.
Mtivir, who cam in th morning with his flicitations, considrd
it propr in his quality of doctor d forcr la consign, * as h told
Princss Mary, and wnt in to s th princ. It happnd that on that
morning of his nam day th princ was in on of his worst moods. H had
bn going about th hous all th morning finding fault with vryon
and prtnding not to undrstand what was said to him and not to b
undrstood himslf. Princss Mary wll knw this mood of quit absorbd
qurulousnss, which gnrally culminatd in a burst of rag, and sh
wnt about all that morning as though facing a cockd and loadd gun
and awaitd th invitabl xplosion. Until th doctor’s arrival th
morning had passd off safly. Aftr admitting th doctor, Princss Mary
sat down with a book in th drawing room nar th door through which sh
could har all that passd in th study.
    * To forc th guard.
At first sh hard only Mtivir’s voic, thn hr fathr’s, thn
both voics bgan spaking at th sam tim, th door was flung opn,
and on th thrshold appard th handsom figur of th trrifid
Mtivir with his shock of black hair, and th princ in his drssing
gown and fz, his fac distortd with fury and th pupils of his ys
rolld downwards.
“You don’t undrstand?” shoutd th princ, “but I do! Frnch
spy, slav of Buonapart, spy, gt out of my hous! B off, I tll
you...” and h slammd th door.
Mtivir, shrugging his shouldrs, wnt up to Madmoisll Bourinn
who at th sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.
“Th princ is not vry wll: bil and rush of blood to th had. Kp
calm, I will call again tomorrow,” said Mtivir; and putting his
fingrs to his lips h hastnd away.
Through th study door cam th sound of slipprd ft and th cry:
“Spis, traitors, traitors vrywhr! Not a momnt’s pac in my
own hous!”
Aftr Mtivir’s dpartur th old princ calld his daughtr in, and
th whol wight of his wrath fll on hr. Sh was to blam that a spy
had bn admittd. Had h not told hr, ys, told hr to mak a list,
and not to admit anyon who was not on that list? Thn why was that
scoundrl admittd? Sh was th caus of it all. With hr, h said, h
could not hav a momnt’s pac and could not di quitly.
“No, ma’am! W must part, w must part! Undrstand that, undrstand
it! I cannot ndur any mor,” h said, and lft th room. Thn, as if
afraid sh might find som mans of consolation, h rturnd and trying
to appar calm addd: “And don’t imagin I hav said this in a
momnt of angr. I am calm. I hav thought it ovr, and it will b
carrid out—w must part; so find som plac for yourslf....” But
h could not rstrain himslf and with th virulnc of which only on
who lovs is capabl, vidntly suffring himslf, h shook his fists at
hr and scramd:
“If only som fool would marry hr!” Thn h slammd th door, snt
for Madmoisll Bourinn, and subsidd into his study.
At two o’clock th six chosn gusts assmbld for dinnr.
Ths gusts—th famous Count Rostopchín, Princ Lopukhín with his
nphw, Gnral Chatróv an old war comrad of th princ’s, and
of th youngr gnration Pirr and Borís Drubtskóy—awaitd th
princ in th drawing room.
Borís, who had com to Moscow on lav a fw days bfor, had bn
anxious to b prsntd to Princ Nicholas Bolkónski, and had contrivd
to ingratiat himslf so wll that th old princ in his cas mad an
xcption to th rul of not rciving bachlors in his hous.
Th princ’s hous did not blong to what is known as fashionabl
socity, but his littl circl—though not much talkd about in
town—was on it was mor flattring to b rcivd in than any othr.
Borís had ralizd this th wk bfor whn th commandr in chif in
his prsnc invitd Rostopchín to dinnr on St. Nicholas’ Day, and
Rostopchín had rplid that h could not com:
“On that day I always go to pay my dvotions to th rlics of Princ
Nicholas Bolkónski.”
“Oh, ys, ys!” rplid th commandr in chif. “How is h?...”
Th small group that assmbld bfor dinnr in th lofty old-fashiond
drawing room with its old furnitur rsmbld th solmn gathring of
a court of justic. All wr silnt or talkd in low tons. Princ
Nicholas cam in srious and taciturn. Princss Mary smd vn quitr
and mor diffidnt than usual. Th gusts wr rluctant to addrss
hr, fling that sh was in no mood for thir convrsation. Count
Rostopchín alon kpt th convrsation going, now rlating th latst
town nws, and now th latst political gossip.
Lopukhín and th old gnral occasionally took part in th
convrsation. Princ Bolkónski listnd as a prsiding judg rcivs a
rport, only now and thn, silntly or by a brif word, showing that
h took hd of what was bing rportd to him. Th ton of th
convrsation was such as indicatd that no on approvd of what was
bing don in th political world. Incidnts wr rlatd vidntly
confirming th opinion that vrything was going from bad to wors, but
whthr tlling a story or giving an opinion th spakr always stoppd,
or was stoppd, at th point byond which his criticism might touch th
sovrign himslf.
At dinnr th talk turnd on th latst political nws: Napolon’s
sizur of th Duk of Oldnburg’s trritory, and th Russian Not,
hostil to Napolon, which had bn snt to all th uropan courts.
“Bonapart trats urop as a pirat dos a capturd vssl,” said
Count Rostopchín, rpating a phras h had uttrd svral tims
bfor. “On only wondrs at th long-suffring or blindnss of th
crownd hads. Now th Pop’s turn has com and Bonapart dosn’t
scrupl to dpos th had of th Catholic Church—yt all kp silnt!
Our sovrign alon has protstd against th sizur of th Duk
of Oldnburg’s trritory, and vn...” Count Rostopchín pausd,
fling that h had rachd th limit byond which cnsur was
impossibl.
“Othr trritoris hav bn offrd in xchang for th Duchy of
Oldnburg,” said Princ Bolkónski. “H shifts th Duks about as
I might mov my srfs from Bald Hills to Boguchárovo or my Ryazán
stats.”
“Th Duk of Oldnburg bars his misfortuns with admirabl
strngth of charactr and rsignation,” rmarkd Borís, joining in
rspctfully.
H said this bcaus on his journy from Ptrsburg h had had th honor
of bing prsntd to th Duk. Princ Bolkónski glancd at th
young man as if about to say somthing in rply, but changd his mind,
vidntly considring him too young.
“I hav rad our protsts about th Oldnburg affair and was surprisd
how badly th Not was wordd,” rmarkd Count Rostopchín in th
casual ton of a man daling with a subjct quit familiar to him.
Pirr lookd at Rostopchín with naïv astonishmnt, not undrstanding
why h should b disturbd by th bad composition of th Not.
“Dos it mattr, Count, how th Not is wordd,” h askd, “so
long as its substanc is forcibl?”
“My dar fllow, with our fiv hundrd thousand troops it should b
asy to hav a good styl,” rturnd Count Rostopchín.
Pirr now undrstood th count’s dissatisfaction with th wording of
th Not.
“On would hav thought quill drivrs nough had sprung up,”
rmarkd th old princ. “Thr in Ptrsburg thy ar always
writing—not nots only but vn nw laws. My Andrw thr has writtn
a whol volum of laws for Russia. Nowadays thy ar always writing!”
and h laughd unnaturally.
Thr was a momntary paus in th convrsation; th old gnral clard
his throat to draw attntion.
“Did you har of th last vnt at th rviw in Ptrsburg? Th
figur cut by th nw Frnch ambassador.”
“h? Ys, I hard somthing: h said somthing awkward in His
Majsty’s prsnc.”
“His Majsty drw attntion to th Grnadir division and to th march
past,” continud th gnral, “and it sms th ambassador took
no notic and allowd himslf to rply that: ‘W in Franc pay no
attntion to such trifls!’ Th mpror did not condscnd to rply.
At th nxt rviw, thy say, th mpror did not onc dign to addrss
him.”
All wr silnt. On this fact rlating to th mpror prsonally, it was
impossibl to pass any judgmnt.
“Impudnt fllows!” said th princ. “You know Mtivir? I turnd
him out of my hous this morning. H was hr; thy admittd him in
spit of my rqust that thy should lt no on in,” h wnt on,
glancing angrily at his daughtr.
And h narratd his whol convrsation with th Frnch doctor and
th rasons that convincd him that Mtivir was a spy. Though ths
rasons wr vry insufficint and obscur, no on mad any rjoindr.
Aftr th roast, champagn was srvd. Th gusts ros to congratulat
th old princ. Princss Mary, too, wnt round to him.
H gav hr a cold, angry look and offrd hr his wrinkld,
clan-shavn chk to kiss. Th whol xprssion of his fac told
hr that h had not forgottn th morning’s talk, that his dcision
rmaind in forc, and only th prsnc of visitors hindrd his
spaking of it to hr now.
Whn thy wnt into th drawing room whr coff was srvd, th old
mn sat togthr.
Princ Nicholas grw mor animatd and xprssd his viws on th
impnding war.
H said that our wars with Bonapart would b disastrous so long as w
sought alliancs with th Grmans and thrust ourslvs into uropan
affairs, into which w had bn drawn by th Pac of Tilsit. “W
ought not to fight ithr for or against Austria. Our political
intrsts ar all in th ast, and in rgard to Bonapart th only thing
is to hav an armd frontir and a firm policy, and h will nvr dar
to cross th Russian frontir, as was th cas in 1807!”
“How can w fight th Frnch, Princ?” said Count Rostopchín.
“Can w arm ourslvs against our tachrs and divinitis? Look at
our youths, look at our ladis! Th Frnch ar our Gods: Paris is our
Kingdom of Havn.”
H bgan spaking loudr, vidntly to b hard by vryon.
“Frnch drsss, Frnch idas, Frnch flings! Thr now, you turnd
Mtivir out by th scruff of his nck bcaus h is a Frnchman and
a scoundrl, but our ladis crawl aftr him on thir kns. I wnt to
a party last night, and thr out of fiv ladis thr wr Roman
Catholics and had th Pop’s indulgnc for doing woolwork on Sundays.
And thy thmslvs sit thr narly nakd, lik th signboards at our
Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, whn on looks at our young popl,
Princ, on would lik to tak Ptr th Grat’s old cudgl out of th
musum and blabor thm in th Russian way till all th nonsns jumps
out of thm.”
All wr silnt. Th old princ lookd at Rostopchín with a smil and
waggd his had approvingly.
“Wll, good-by, your xcllncy, kp wll!” said Rostopchín,
gtting up with charactristic brisknss and holding out his hand to th
princ.
“Good-by, my dar fllow.... His words ar music, I nvr tir of
haring him!” said th old princ, kping hold of th hand and
offring his chk to b kissd.
Following Rostopchín’s xampl th othrs also ros.
CHAPTR IV
Princss Mary as sh sat listning to th old mn’s talk and
faultfinding, undrstood nothing of what sh hard; sh only wondrd
whthr th gusts had all obsrvd hr fathr’s hostil attitud
toward hr. Sh did not vn notic th spcial attntions and
amiabilitis shown hr during dinnr by Borís Drubtskóy, who was
visiting thm for th third tim alrady.
Princss Mary turnd with absnt-mindd qustioning look to Pirr, who
hat in hand and with a smil on his fac was th last of th gusts to
approach hr aftr th old princ had gon out and thy wr lft alon
in th drawing room.
“May I stay a littl longr?” h said, ltting his stout body sink
into an armchair bsid hr.
“Oh ys,” sh answrd. “You noticd nothing?” hr look askd.
Pirr was in an agrabl aftr-dinnr mood. H lookd straight bfor
him and smild quitly.
“Hav you known that young man long, Princss?” h askd.
“Who?”
“Drubtskóy.”
“No, not long....”
“Do you lik him?”
“Ys, h is an agrabl young man.... Why do you ask m that?” said
Princss Mary, still thinking of that morning’s convrsation with hr
fathr.
“Bcaus I hav noticd that whn a young man coms on lav from
Ptrsburg to Moscow it is usually with th objct of marrying an
hirss.”
“You hav obsrvd that?” said Princss Mary.
“Ys,” rturnd Pirr with a smil, “and this young man now
manags mattrs so that whr thr is a walthy hirss thr h is
too. I can rad him lik a book. At prsnt h is hsitating whom to lay
sig to—you or Madmoisll Juli Karágina. H is vry attntiv to
hr.”
“H visits thm?”
“Ys, vry oftn. And do you know th nw way of courting?” said
Pirr with an amusd smil, vidntly in that chrful mood of good
humord raillry for which h so oftn rproachd himslf in his diary.
“No,” rplid Princss Mary.
“To plas Moscow girls nowadays on has to b mlancholy. H is vry
mlancholy with Madmoisll Karágina,” said Pirr.
“Rally?” askd Princss Mary, looking into Pirr’s kindly
fac and still thinking of hr own sorrow. “It would b a rlif,”
thought sh, “if I vnturd to confid what I am fling to somon.
I should lik to tll vrything to Pirr. H is kind and gnrous. It
would b a rlif. H would giv m advic.”
“Would you marry him?”
“Oh, my God, Count, thr ar momnts whn I would marry anybody!”
sh crid suddnly to hr own surpris and with tars in hr voic.
“Ah, how bittr it is to lov somon nar to you and to fl
that...” sh wnt on in a trmbling voic, “that you can do nothing
for him but griv him, and to know that you cannot altr this. Thn
thr is only on thing lft—to go away, but whr could I go?”
“What is wrong? What is it, Princss?”
But without finishing what sh was saying, Princss Mary burst into
tars.
“I don’t know what is th mattr with m today. Don’t tak any
notic—forgt what I hav said!”
Pirr’s gaity vanishd compltly. H anxiously qustiond th
princss, askd hr to spak out fully and confid hr grif to him; but
sh only rpatd that sh bggd him to forgt what sh had said, that
sh did not rmmbr what sh had said, and that sh had no troubl
xcpt th on h knw of—that Princ Andrw’s marriag thratnd
to caus a ruptur btwn fathr and son.
“Hav you any nws of th Rostóvs?” sh askd, to chang th
subjct. “I was told thy ar coming soon. I am also xpcting Andrw
any day. I should lik thm to mt hr.”
“And how dos h now rgard th mattr?” askd Pirr, rfrring to
th old princ.
Princss Mary shook hr had.
“What is to b don? In a fw months th yar will b up. Th thing
is impossibl. I only wish I could spar my brothr th first momnts.
I wish thy would com soonr. I hop to b frinds with hr. You hav
known thm a long tim,” said Princss Mary. “Tll m honstly
th whol truth: what sort of girl is sh, and what do you think of
hr?—Th ral truth, bcaus you know Andrw is risking so much doing
this against his fathr’s will that I should lik to know....”
An undfind instinct told Pirr that ths xplanations, and
rpatd rqusts to b told th whol truth, xprssd ill-will on
th princss’ part toward hr futur sistr-in-law and a wish that
h should disapprov of Andrw’s choic; but in rply h said what h
flt rathr than what h thought.
“I don’t know how to answr your qustion,” h said, blushing
without knowing why. “I rally don’t know what sort of girl sh is;
I can’t analyz hr at all. Sh is nchanting, but what maks hr so I
don’t know. That is all on can say about hr.”
Princss Mary sighd, and th xprssion on hr fac said: “Ys,
that’s what I xpctd and fard.”
“Is sh clvr?” sh askd.
Pirr considrd.
“I think not,” h said, “and yt—ys. Sh dos not dign to b
clvr.... Oh no, sh is simply nchanting, and that is all.”
Princss Mary again shook hr had disapprovingly.
“Ah, I so long to lik hr! Tll hr so if you s hr bfor I do.”
“I har thy ar xpctd vry soon,” said Pirr.
Princss Mary told Pirr of hr plan to bcom intimat with hr futur
sistr-in-law as soon as th Rostóvs arrivd and to try to accustom th
old princ to hr.
CHAPTR V
Borís had not succdd in making a walthy match in Ptrsburg, so
with th sam objct in viw h cam to Moscow. Thr h wavrd btwn
th two richst hirsss, Juli and Princss Mary. Though Princss
Mary dspit hr plainnss smd to him mor attractiv than Juli, h,
without knowing why, flt awkward about paying court to hr. Whn thy
had last mt on th old princ’s nam day, sh had answrd at random
all his attmpts to talk sntimntally, vidntly not listning to what
h was saying.
Juli on th contrary accptd his attntions radily, though in a
mannr pculiar to hrslf.
Sh was twnty-svn. Aftr th dath of hr brothrs sh had bcom
vry walthy. Sh was by now dciddly plain, but thought hrslf not
mrly as good-looking as bfor but vn far mor attractiv. Sh
was confirmd in this dlusion by th fact that sh had bcom a vry
walthy hirss and also by th fact that th oldr sh grw th lss
dangrous sh bcam to mn, and th mor frly thy could associat
with hr and avail thmslvs of hr supprs, soirs, and th animatd
company that assmbld at hr hous, without incurring any obligation.
A man who would hav bn afraid tn yars bfor of going vry day
to th hous whn thr was a girl of svntn thr, for far of
compromising hr and committing himslf, would now go boldly vry day
and trat hr not as a marriagabl girl but as a sxlss acquaintanc.
That wintr th Karágins’ hous was th most agrabl and hospitabl
in Moscow. In addition to th formal vning and dinnr partis, a larg
company, chifly of mn, gathrd thr vry day, supping at midnight
and staying till thr in th morning. Juli nvr missd a ball, a
promnad, or a play. Hr drsss wr always of th latst fashion.
But in spit of that sh smd to b disillusiond about vrything and
told vryon that sh did not bliv ithr in frindship or in lov,
or any of th joys of lif, and xpctd pac only “yondr.” Sh
adoptd th ton of on who has suffrd a grat disappointmnt, lik a
girl who has ithr lost th man sh lovd or bn crully dcivd by
him. Though nothing of th kind had happnd to hr sh was rgardd in
that light, and had vn hrslf com to bliv that sh had suffrd
much in lif. This mlancholy, which did not prvnt hr amusing
hrslf, did not hindr th young popl who cam to hr hous from
passing th tim plasantly. vry visitor who cam to th hous paid
his tribut to th mlancholy mood of th hostss, and thn amusd
himslf with socity gossip, dancing, intllctual gams, and bouts
rims, which wr in vogu at th Karágins’. Only a fw of ths
young mn, among thm Borís, ntrd mor dply into Juli’s
mlancholy, and with ths sh had prolongd convrsations in privat
on th vanity of all worldly things, and to thm sh showd hr albums
filld with mournful sktchs, maxims, and vrss.
To Borís, Juli was particularly gracious: sh rgrttd his arly
disillusionmnt with lif, offrd him such consolation of frindship
as sh who had hrslf suffrd so much could rndr, and showd him
hr album. Borís sktchd two trs in th album and wrot: “Rustic
trs, your dark branchs shd gloom and mlancholy upon m.”
On anothr pag h drw a tomb, and wrot:
    La mort st scourabl t la mort st tranquill.
    Ah! contr ls doulurs il n’y a pas d’autr asil. *
    * Dath givs rlif and dath is pacful.
Ah! from suffring thr is no othr rfug.
Juli said this was charming
“Thr is somthing so nchanting in th smil of mlancholy,” sh
said to Borís, rpating word for word a passag sh had copid from a
book. “It is a ray of light in th darknss, a shad btwn sadnss
and dspair, showing th possibility of consolation.”
In rply Borís wrot ths lins:
    Alimnt d poison d’un âm trop snsibl,
    Toi, sans qui l bonhur m srait impossibl,
    Tndr mlancholi, ah, vins m consolr,
    Vins calmr ls tourmnts d ma sombr rtrait,
    t mêl un doucur scrèt
    A cs plurs qu j sns coulr. *
      *Poisonous nourishmnt of a too snsitiv soul,
     Thou, without whom happinss would for m b impossibl,
     Tndr mlancholy, ah, com to consol m,
     Com to calm th tormnts of my gloomy rtrat,
     And mingl a scrt swtnss
     With ths tars that I fl to b flowing.
For Borís, Juli playd most dolful nocturns on hr harp. Borís
rad Poor Liza aloud to hr, and mor than onc intrruptd th rading
bcaus of th motions that chokd him. Mting at larg gathrings
Juli and Borís lookd on on anothr as th only souls who undrstood
on anothr in a world of indiffrnt popl.
Anna Mikháylovna, who oftn visitd th Karágins, whil playing cards
with th mothr mad carful inquiris as to Juli’s dowry (sh was
to hav two stats in Pnza and th Nizhgórod forsts). Anna
Mikháylovna rgardd th rfind sadnss that unitd hr son to th
walthy Juli with motion, and rsignation to th Divin will.
“You ar always charming and mlancholy, my dar Juli,” sh said to
th daughtr. “Borís says his soul finds rpos at your hous. H has
suffrd so many disappointmnts and is so snsitiv,” said sh to
th mothr. “Ah, my dar, I can’t tll you how fond I hav grown
of Juli lattrly,” sh said to hr son. “But who could hlp loving
hr? Sh is an anglic bing! Ah, Borís, Borís!”—sh pausd.
“And how I pity hr mothr,” sh wnt on; “today sh showd m hr
accounts and lttrs from Pnza (thy hav normous stats thr), and
sh, poor thing, has no on to hlp hr, and thy do chat hr so!”
Borís smild almost imprcptibly whil listning to his mothr. H
laughd blandly at hr naïv diplomacy but listnd to what sh had
to say, and somtims qustiond hr carfully about th Pnza and
Nizhgórod stats.
Juli had long bn xpcting a proposal from hr mlancholy adorr and
was rady to accpt it; but som scrt fling of rpulsion for hr,
for hr passionat dsir to gt marrid, for hr artificiality, and
a fling of horror at rnouncing th possibility of ral lov still
rstraind Borís. His lav was xpiring. H spnt vry day and whol
days at th Karágins’, and vry day on thinking th mattr ovr
told himslf that h would propos tomorrow. But in Juli’s prsnc,
looking at hr rd fac and chin (narly always powdrd), hr moist
ys, and hr xprssion of continual radinss to pass at onc from
mlancholy to an unnatural raptur of marrid bliss, Borís could not
uttr th dcisiv words, though in imagination h had long rgardd
himslf as th possssor of thos Pnza and Nizhgórod stats and
had apportiond th us of th incom from thm. Juli saw Borís’
indcision, and somtims th thought occurrd to hr that sh was
rpulsiv to him, but hr fminin slf-dcption immdiatly supplid
hr with consolation, and sh told hrslf that h was only shy from
lov. Hr mlancholy, howvr, bgan to turn to irritability, and not
long bfor Borís’ dpartur sh formd a dfinit plan of action.
Just as Borís’ lav of absnc was xpiring, Anatol Kurágin mad
his apparanc in Moscow, and of cours in th Karágins’ drawing
room, and Juli, suddnly abandoning hr mlancholy, bcam chrful and
vry attntiv to Kurágin.
“My dar,” said Anna Mikháylovna to hr son, “I know from a
rliabl sourc that Princ Vasíli has snt his son to Moscow to gt
him marrid to Juli. I am so fond of Juli that I should b sorry for
hr. What do you think of it, my dar?”
Th ida of bing mad a fool of and of having thrown away that whol
month of arduous mlancholy srvic to Juli, and of sing all
th rvnu from th Pnza stats which h had alrady mntally
apportiond and put to propr us fall into th hands of anothr, and
spcially into th hands of that idiot Anatol, paind Borís. H drov
to th Karágins’ with th firm intntion of proposing. Juli mt
him in a gay, carlss mannr, spok casually of how sh had njoyd
ystrday’s ball, and askd whn h was laving. Though Borís had
com intntionally to spak of his lov and thrfor mant to b
tndr, h bgan spaking irritably of fminin inconstancy, of how
asily womn can turn from sadnss to joy, and how thir moods dpnd
solly on who happns to b paying court to thm. Juli was offndd and
rplid that it was tru that a woman nds varity, and th sam thing
ovr and ovr again would wary anyon.
“Thn I should advis you...” Borís bgan, wishing to sting hr;
but at that instant th galling thought occurrd to him that h might
hav to lav Moscow without having accomplishd his aim, and hav
vainly wastd his fforts—which was a thing h nvr allowd to
happn.
H chckd himslf in th middl of th sntnc, lowrd his ys to
avoid sing hr unplasantly irritatd and irrsolut fac, and said:
“I did not com hr at all to quarrl with you. On th contrary...”
H glancd at hr to mak sur that h might go on. Hr irritability had
suddnly quit vanishd, and hr anxious, imploring ys wr fixd on
him with grdy xpctation. “I can always arrang so as not to s
hr oftn,” thought Borís. “Th affair has bn bgun and must b
finishd!” H blushd hotly, raisd his ys to hrs, and said:
“You know my flings for you!”
Thr was no nd to say mor: Juli’s fac shon with triumph and
slf-satisfaction; but sh forcd Borís to say all that is said on such
occasions—that h lovd hr and had nvr lovd any othr woman mor
than hr. Sh knw that for th Pnza stats and Nizhgórod forsts
sh could dmand this, and sh rcivd what sh dmandd.
Th affiancd coupl, no longr alluding to trs that shd gloom and
mlancholy upon thm, plannd th arrangmnts of a splndid hous in
Ptrsburg, paid calls, and prpard vrything for a brilliant wdding.
CHAPTR VI
At th nd of January old Count Rostóv wnt to Moscow with Natásha and
Sónya. Th countss was still unwll and unabl to travl but it was
impossibl to wait for hr rcovry. Princ Andrw was xpctd in
Moscow any day, th troussau had to b ordrd and th stat nar
Moscow had to b sold, bsids which th opportunity of prsnting his
futur daughtr-in-law to old Princ Bolkónski whil h was in Moscow
could not b missd. Th Rostóvs’ Moscow hous had not bn hatd
that wintr and, as thy had com only for a short tim and th countss
was not with thm, th count dcidd to stay with Márya Dmítrivna
Akhrosímova, who had long bn prssing hr hospitality on thm.
Lat on vning th Rostóvs’ four slighs drov into Márya
Dmítrivna’s courtyard in th old Konyúshny strt. Márya
Dmítrivna livd alon. Sh had alrady marrid off hr daughtr, and
hr sons wr all in th srvic.
Sh hld hrslf as rct, told vryon hr opinion as candidly,
loudly, and bluntly as vr, and hr whol baring smd a rproach
to othrs for any waknss, passion, or tmptation—th possibility of
which sh did not admit. From arly in th morning, waring a drssing
jackt, sh attndd to hr houshold affairs, and thn sh drov out:
on holy days to church and aftr th srvic to jails and prisons on
affairs of which sh nvr spok to anyon. On ordinary days, aftr
drssing, sh rcivd ptitionrs of various classs, of whom thr
wr always som. Thn sh had dinnr, a substantial and apptizing mal
at which thr wr always thr or four gusts; aftr dinnr sh playd
a gam of boston, and at night sh had th nwspaprs or a nw book rad
to hr whil sh knittd. Sh rarly mad an xcption and wnt out to
pay visits, and thn only to th most important prsons in th town.
Sh had not yt gon to bd whn th Rostóvs arrivd and th pully of
th hall door squakd from th cold as it lt in th Rostóvs and thir
srvants. Márya Dmítrivna, with hr spctacls hanging down on hr
nos and hr had flung back, stood in th hall doorway looking with
a strn, grim fac at th nw arrivals. On might hav thought sh was
angry with th travlrs and would immdiatly turn thm out, had sh
not at th sam tim bn giving carful instructions to th srvants
for th accommodation of th visitors and thir blongings.
“Th count’s things? Bring thm hr,” sh said, pointing to th
portmantaus and not grting anyon. “Th young ladis’? Thr
to th lft. Now what ar you dawdling for?” sh crid to th maids.
“Gt th samovar rady!... You’v grown plumpr and prttir,” sh
rmarkd, drawing Natásha (whos chks wr glowing from th cold)
to hr by th hood. “Foo! You ar cold! Now tak off your things,
quick!” sh shoutd to th count who was going to kiss hr hand.
“You’r half frozn, I’m sur! Bring som rum for ta!... Bonjour,
Sónya dar!” sh addd, turning to Sónya and indicating by this
Frnch grting hr slightly contmptuous though affctionat attitud
toward hr.
Whn thy cam in to ta, having takn off thir outdoor things and
tidid thmslvs up aftr thir journy, Márya Dmítrivna kissd thm
all in du ordr.
“I’m hartily glad you hav com and ar staying with m. It was
high tim,” sh said, giving Natásha a significant look. “Th old
man is hr and his son’s xpctd any day. You’ll hav to mak his
acquaintanc. But w’ll spak of that latr on,” sh addd, glancing
at Sónya with a look that showd sh did not want to spak of it in hr
prsnc. “Now listn,” sh said to th count. “What do you want
tomorrow? Whom will you snd for? Shinshín?” sh crookd on of hr
fingrs. “Th snivling Anna Mikháylovna? That’s two. Sh’s hr
with hr son. Th son is gtting marrid! Thn Bzúkhov, h? H is hr
too, with his wif. H ran away from hr and sh cam galloping aftr
him. H dind with m on Wdnsday. As for thm”—and sh pointd to
th girls—“tomorrow I’ll tak thm first to th Ibrian shrin
of th Mothr of God, and thn w’ll driv to th Supr-Rogu’s.
I suppos you’ll hav vrything nw. Don’t judg by m: slvs
nowadays ar this siz! Th othr day young Princss Irína Vasílvna
cam to s m; sh was an awful sight—lookd as if sh had put two
barrls on hr arms. You know not a day passs now without som nw
fashion.... And what hav you to do yourslf?” sh askd th count
strnly.
“On thing has com on top of anothr: hr rags to buy, and now a
purchasr has turnd up for th Moscow stat and for th hous. If you
will b so kind, I’ll fix a tim and go down to th stat just for a
day, and lav my lassis with you.”
“All right. All right. Thy’ll b saf with m, as saf as in
Chancry! I’ll tak thm whr thy must go, scold thm a bit, and
pt thm a bit,” said Márya Dmítrivna, touching hr goddaughtr and
favorit, Natásha, on th chk with hr larg hand.
Nxt morning Márya Dmítrivna took th young ladis to th Ibrian
shrin of th Mothr of God and to Madam Supprt-Rogut, who was so
afraid of Márya Dmítrivna that sh always lt hr hav costums at
a loss mrly to gt rid of hr. Márya Dmítrivna ordrd almost th
whol troussau. Whn thy got hom sh turnd vrybody out of th room
xcpt Natásha, and thn calld hr pt to hr armchair.
“Wll, now w’ll talk. I congratulat you on your btrothd.
You’v hookd a fin fllow! I am glad for your sak and I’v known
him sinc h was so high.” Sh hld hr hand a coupl of ft from th
ground. Natásha blushd happily. “I lik him and all his family.
Now listn! You know that old Princ Nicholas much disliks his son’s
marrying. Th old fllow’s crotchty! Of cours Princ Andrw is not
a child and can shift without him, but it’s not nic to ntr a family
against a fathr’s will. On wants to do it pacfully and lovingly.
You’r a clvr girl and you’ll know how to manag. B kind, and us
your wits. Thn all will b wll.”
Natásha rmaind silnt, from shynss Márya Dmítrivna supposd, but
rally bcaus sh dislikd anyon intrfring in what touchd hr lov
of Princ Andrw, which smd to hr so apart from all human affairs
that no on could undrstand it. Sh lovd and knw Princ Andrw, h
lovd hr only, and was to com on of ths days and tak hr. Sh
wantd nothing mor.
“You s I hav known him a long tim and am also fond of Mary, your
futur sistr-in-law. ‘Husbands’ sistrs bring up blistrs,’
but this on wouldn’t hurt a fly. Sh has askd m to bring you two
togthr. Tomorrow you’ll go with your fathr to s hr. B vry
nic and affctionat to hr: you’r youngr than sh. Whn h coms,
h’ll find you alrady know his sistr and fathr and ar likd by
thm. Am I right or not? Won’t that b bst?”
“Ys, it will,” Natásha answrd rluctantly.
CHAPTR VII
Nxt day, by Márya Dmítrivna’s advic, Count Rostóv took Natásha
to call on Princ Nicholas Bolkónski. Th count did not st out
chrfully on this visit, at hart h flt afraid. H wll rmmbrd
th last intrviw h had had with th old princ at th tim of th
nrollmnt, whn in rply to an invitation to dinnr h had had to
listn to an angry rprimand for not having providd his full quota of
mn. Natásha, on th othr hand, having put on hr bst gown, was in
th highst spirits. “Thy can’t hlp liking m,” sh thought.
“vrybody always has likd m, and I am so willing to do anything
thy wish, so rady to b fond of him—for bing his fathr—and of
hr—for bing his sistr—that thr is no rason for thm not to
lik m....”
Thy drov up to th gloomy old hous on th Vozdvízhnka and ntrd
th vstibul.
“Wll, th Lord hav mrcy on us!” said th count, half in jst,
half in arnst; but Natásha noticd that hr fathr was flurrid on
ntring th antroom and inquird timidly and softly whthr th princ
and princss wr at hom.
Whn thy had bn announcd a prturbation was noticabl among th
srvants. Th footman who had gon to announc thm was stoppd by
anothr in th larg hall and thy whisprd to on anothr. Thn a
maidsrvant ran into th hall and hurridly said somthing, mntioning
th princss. At last an old, cross looking footman cam and announcd
to th Rostóvs that th princ was not rciving, but that th princss
bggd thm to walk up. Th first prson who cam to mt th visitors
was Madmoisll Bourinn. Sh grtd th fathr and daughtr
with spcial politnss and showd thm to th princss’ room. Th
princss, looking xcitd and nrvous, hr fac flushd in patchs, ran
in to mt th visitors, trading havily, and vainly trying to appar
cordial and at as. From th first glanc Princss Mary did not lik
Natásha. Sh thought hr too fashionably drssd, frivolously gay and
vain. Sh did not at all raliz that bfor having sn hr futur
sistr-in-law sh was prjudicd against hr by involuntary nvy of hr
bauty, youth, and happinss, as wll as by jalousy of hr brothr’s
lov for hr. Apart from this insuprabl antipathy to hr, Princss
Mary was agitatd just thn bcaus on th Rostóvs’ bing announcd,
th old princ had shoutd that h did not wish to s thm, that
Princss Mary might do so if sh chos, but thy wr not to b admittd
to him. Sh had dcidd to rciv thm, but fard lst th princ
might at any momnt indulg in som frak, as h smd much upst by
th Rostóvs’ visit.
“Thr, my dar princss, I’v brought you my songstrss,” said
th count, bowing and looking round unasily as if afraid th old princ
might appar. “I am so glad you should gt to know on anothr... vry
sorry th princ is still ailing,” and aftr a fw mor commonplac
rmarks h ros. “If you’ll allow m to lav my Natásha in your
hands for a quartr of an hour, Princss, I’ll driv round to s Anna
Smënovna, it’s quit nar in th Dogs’ Squar, and thn I’ll
com back for hr.”
Th count had dvisd this diplomatic rus (as h aftrwards told his
daughtr) to giv th futur sistrs-in-law an opportunity to talk
to on anothr frly, but anothr motiv was to avoid th dangr of
ncountring th old princ, of whom h was afraid. H did not mntion
this to his daughtr, but Natásha noticd hr fathr’s nrvousnss
and anxity and flt mortifid by it. Sh blushd for him, grw still
angrir at having blushd, and lookd at th princss with a bold and
dfiant xprssion which said that sh was not afraid of anybody. Th
princss told th count that sh would b dlightd, and only bggd him
to stay longr at Anna Smënovna’s, and h dpartd.
Dspit th unasy glancs thrown at hr by Princss Mary—who wishd
to hav a têt-à-têt with Natásha—Madmoisll Bourinn
rmaind in th room and prsistntly talkd about Moscow amusmnts and
thatrs. Natásha flt offndd by th hsitation sh had noticd in
th antroom, by hr fathr’s nrvousnss, and by th unnatural mannr
of th princss who—sh thought—was making a favor of rciving hr,
and so vrything displasd hr. Sh did not lik Princss Mary, whom
sh thought vry plain, affctd, and dry. Natásha suddnly shrank
into hrslf and involuntarily assumd an offhand air which alinatd
Princss Mary still mor. Aftr fiv minuts of irksom, constraind
convrsation, thy hard th sound of slipprd ft rapidly
approaching. Princss Mary lookd frightnd.
Th door opnd and th old princ, in a drssing gown and a whit
nightcap, cam in.
“Ah, madam!” h bgan. “Madam, Countss... Countss Rostóva, if
I am not mistakn... I bg you to xcus m, to xcus m... I did not
know, madam. God is my witnss, I did not know you had honord us with
a visit, and I cam in such a costum only to s my daughtr. I bg you
to xcus m... God is my witnss, I didn’t know—” h rpatd,
strssing th word “God” so unnaturally and so unplasantly that
Princss Mary stood with downcast ys not daring to look ithr at hr
fathr or at Natásha.
Nor did th lattr, having risn and curtsid, know what to do.
Madmoisll Bourinn alon smild agrably.
“I bg you to xcus m, xcus m! God is my witnss, I did not
know,” muttrd th old man, and aftr looking Natásha ovr from had
to foot h wnt out.
Madmoisll Bourinn was th first to rcovr hrslf aftr this
apparition and bgan spaking about th princ’s indisposition.
Natásha and Princss Mary lookd at on anothr in silnc, and th
longr thy did so without saying what thy wantd to say, th gratr
grw thir antipathy to on anothr.
Whn th count rturnd, Natásha was impolitly plasd and hastnd
to gt away: at that momnt sh hatd th stiff, ldrly princss, who
could plac hr in such an mbarrassing position and had spnt half an
hour with hr without onc mntioning Princ Andrw. “I couldn’t
bgin talking about him in th prsnc of that Frnchwoman,” thought
Natásha. Th sam thought was manwhil tormnting Princss Mary. Sh
knw what sh ought to hav said to Natásha, but sh had bn unabl
to say it bcaus Madmoisll Bourinn was in th way, and bcaus,
without knowing why, sh flt it vry difficult to spak of th
marriag. Whn th count was alrady laving th room, Princss Mary
wnt up hurridly to Natásha, took hr by th hand, and said with a
dp sigh:
“Wait, I must...”
Natásha glancd at hr ironically without knowing why.
“Dar Natali,” said Princss Mary, “I want you to know that I am
glad my brothr has found happinss....”
Sh pausd, fling that sh was not tlling th truth. Natásha noticd
this and gussd its rason.
“I think, Princss, it is not convnint to spak of that now,”
sh said with xtrnal dignity and coldnss, though sh flt th tars
choking hr.
“What hav I said and what hav I don?” thought sh, as soon as sh
was out of th room.
Thy waitd a long tim for Natásha to com to dinnr that day. Sh sat
in hr room crying lik a child, blowing hr nos and sobbing. Sónya
stood bsid hr, kissing hr hair.
“Natásha, what is it about?” sh askd. “What do thy mattr to
you? It will all pass, Natásha.”
“But if you only knw how offnsiv it was... as if I...”
“Don’t talk about it, Natásha. It wasn’t your fault so why should
you mind? Kiss m,” said Sónya.
Natásha raisd hr had and, kissing hr frind on th lips, prssd
hr wt fac against hr.
“I can’t tll you, I don’t know. No on’s to blam,” said
Natásha—“It’s my fault. But it all hurts trribly. Oh, why
dosn’t h com?...”
Sh cam in to dinnr with rd ys. Márya Dmítrivna, who knw how
th princ had rcivd th Rostóvs, prtndd not to notic how upst
Natásha was and jstd rsolutly and loudly at tabl with th count
and th othr gusts.
CHAPTR VIII
That vning th Rostóvs wnt to th Opra, for which Márya
Dmítrivna had takn a box.
Natásha did not want to go, but could not rfus Márya Dmítrivna’s
kind offr which was intndd xprssly for hr. Whn sh cam rady
drssd into th ballroom to await hr fathr, and looking in th larg
mirror thr saw that sh was prtty, vry prtty, sh flt vn mor
sad, but it was a swt, tndr sadnss.
“O God, if h wr hr now I would not bhav as I did thn, but
diffrntly. I would not b silly and afraid of things, I would simply
mbrac him, cling to him, and mak him look at m with thos sarching
inquiring ys with which h has so oftn lookd at m, and thn I
would mak him laugh as h usd to laugh. And his ys—how I s thos
ys!” thought Natásha. “And what do his fathr and sistr mattr
to m? I lov him alon, him, him, with that fac and thos ys, with
his smil, manly and yt childlik.... No, I had bttr not think of
him; not think of him but forgt him, quit forgt him for th prsnt.
I can’t bar this waiting and I shall cry in a minut!” and sh
turnd away from th glass, making an ffort not to cry. “And how
can Sónya lov Nicholas so calmly and quitly and wait so long and so
patintly?” thought sh, looking at Sónya, who also cam in quit
rady, with a fan in hr hand. “No, sh’s altogthr diffrnt. I
can’t!”
Natásha at that momnt flt so softnd and tndr that it was not
nough for hr to lov and know sh was blovd, sh wantd now, at
onc, to mbrac th man sh lovd, to spak and har from him words of
lov such as filld hr hart. Whil sh sat in th carriag bsid hr
fathr, pnsivly watching th lights of th strt lamps flickring on
th frozn window, sh flt still saddr and mor in lov, and forgot
whr sh was going and with whom. Having falln into th lin of
carriags, th Rostóvs’ carriag drov up to th thatr, its whls
squaking ovr th snow. Natásha and Sónya, holding up thir drsss,
jumpd out quickly. Th count got out hlpd by th footmn, and,
passing among mn and womn who wr ntring and th program sllrs,
thy all thr wnt along th corridor to th first row of boxs.
Through th closd doors th music was alrady audibl.
“Natásha, your hair!...” whisprd Sónya.
An attndant dfrntially and quickly slippd bfor th ladis and
opnd th door of thir box. Th music soundd loudr and through th
door rows of brightly lit boxs in which ladis sat with bar arms and
shouldrs, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittrd bfor
thir ys. A lady ntring th nxt box shot a glanc of fminin nvy
at Natásha. Th curtain had not yt risn and th ovrtur was bing
playd. Natásha, smoothing hr gown, wnt in with Sónya and sat down,
scanning th brilliant tirs of boxs opposit. A snsation sh had not
xprincd for a long tim—that of hundrds of ys looking at
hr bar arms and nck—suddnly affctd hr both agrably and
disagrably and calld up a whol crowd of mmoris, dsirs and
motions associatd with that fling.
Th two rmarkably prtty girls, Natásha and Sónya, with Count Rostóv
who had not bn sn in Moscow for a long tim, attractd gnral
attntion. Morovr, vrybody knw vaguly of Natásha’s ngagmnt
to Princ Andrw, and knw that th Rostóvs had livd in th country
vr sinc, and all lookd with curiosity at a fianc who was making
on of th bst matchs in Russia.
Natásha’s looks, as vryon told hr, had improvd in th country,
and that vning thanks to hr agitation sh was particularly prtty.
Sh struck thos who saw hr by hr fullnss of lif and bauty,
combind with hr indiffrnc to vrything about hr. Hr black ys
lookd at th crowd without sking anyon, and hr dlicat arm, bar
to abov th lbow, lay on th vlvt dg of th box, whil, vidntly
unconsciously, sh opnd and closd hr hand in tim to th music,
crumpling hr program. “Look, thr’s Alnina,” said Sónya,
“with hr mothr, isn’t it?”
“Dar m, Michal Kirílovich has grown still stoutr!” rmarkd th
count.
“Look at our Anna Mikháylovna—what a haddrss sh has on!”
“Th Karágins, Juli—and Borís with thm. On can s at onc that
thy’r ngagd....”
“Drubtskóy has proposd?”
“Oh ys, I hard it today,” said Shinshín, coming into th
Rostóvs’ box.
Natásha lookd in th dirction in which hr fathr’s ys wr
turnd and saw Juli sitting bsid hr mothr with a happy look on hr
fac and a string of parls round hr thick rd nck—which Natásha
knw was covrd with powdr. Bhind thm, waring a smil and laning
ovr with an ar to Juli’s mouth, was Borís’ handsom smoothly
brushd had. H lookd at th Rostóvs from undr his brows and said
somthing, smiling, to his btrothd.
“Thy ar talking about us, about m and him!” thought Natásha.
“And h no doubt is calming hr jalousy of m. Thy ndn’t troubl
thmslvs! If only thy knw how littl I am concrnd about any of
thm.”
Bhind thm sat Anna Mikháylovna waring a grn haddrss and with a
happy look of rsignation to th will of God on hr fac. Thir box was
prvadd by that atmosphr of an affiancd coupl which Natásha knw
so wll and likd so much. Sh turnd away and suddnly rmmbrd all
that had bn so humiliating in hr morning’s visit.
“What right has h not to wish to rciv m into his family? Oh,
bttr not think of it—not till h coms back!” sh told hrslf,
and bgan looking at th facs, som strang and som familiar, in
th stalls. In th front, in th vry cntr, laning back against
th orchstra rail, stood Dólokhov in a Prsian drss, his curly hair
brushd up into a hug shock. H stood in full viw of th audinc,
wll awar that h was attracting vryon’s attntion, yt as much at
as as though h wr in his own room. Around him throngd Moscow’s
most brilliant young mn, whom h vidntly dominatd.
Th count, laughing, nudgd th blushing Sónya and pointd to hr
formr adorr.
“Do you rcogniz him?” said h. “And whr has h sprung from?”
h askd, turning to Shinshín. “Didn’t h vanish somwhr?”
“H did,” rplid Shinshín. “H was in th Caucasus and ran
away from thr. Thy say h has bn acting as ministr to som ruling
princ in Prsia, whr h killd th Shah’s brothr. Now all th
Moscow ladis ar mad about him! It’s ‘Dólokhov th Prsian’ that
dos it! W nvr har a word but Dólokhov is mntiond. Thy swar
by him, thy offr him to you as thy would a dish of choic strlt.
Dólokhov and Anatol Kurágin hav turnd all our ladis’ hads.”
A tall, bautiful woman with a mass of plaitd hair and much xposd
plump whit shouldrs and nck, round which sh wor a doubl string of
larg parls, ntrd th adjoining box rustling hr havy silk drss
and took a long tim sttling into hr plac.
Natásha involuntarily gazd at that nck, thos shouldrs, and parls
and coiffur, and admird th bauty of th shouldrs and th parls.
Whil Natásha was fixing hr gaz on hr for th scond tim th lady
lookd round and, mting th count’s ys, noddd to him and smild.
Sh was th Countss Bzúkhova, Pirr’s wif, and th count, who
knw vryon in socity, land ovr and spok to hr.
“Hav you bn hr long, Countss?” h inquird. “I’ll call,
I’ll call to kiss your hand. I’m hr on businss and hav brought
my girls with m. Thy say Smënova acts marvlously. Count Pirr
nvr usd to forgt us. Is h hr?”
“Ys, h mant to look in,” answrd Hlèn, and glancd
attntivly at Natásha.
Count Rostóv rsumd his sat.
“Handsom, isn’t sh?” h whisprd to Natásha.
“Wondrful!” answrd Natásha. “Sh’s a woman on could asily
fall in lov with.”
Just thn th last chords of th ovrtur wr hard and th conductor
tappd with his stick. Som latcomrs took thir sats in th stalls,
and th curtain ros.
As soon as it ros vryon in th boxs and stalls bcam silnt, and
all th mn, old and young, in uniform and vning drss, and all th
womn with gms on thir bar flsh, turnd thir whol attntion with
agr curiosity to th stag. Natásha too bgan to look at it.
CHAPTR IX
Th floor of th stag consistd of smooth boards, at th sids was
som paintd cardboard rprsnting trs, and at th back was a cloth
strtchd ovr boards. In th cntr of th stag sat som girls in rd
bodics and whit skirts. On vry fat girl in a whit silk drss sat
apart on a low bnch, to th back of which a pic of grn cardboard
was glud. Thy all sang somthing. Whn thy had finishd thir song
th girl in whit wnt up to th promptr’s box and a man with tight
silk trousrs ovr his stout lgs, and holding a plum and a daggr,
wnt up to hr and bgan singing, waving his arms about.
First th man in th tight trousrs sang alon, thn sh sang, thn thy
both pausd whil th orchstra playd and th man fingrd th hand
of th girl in whit, obviously awaiting th bat to start singing with
hr. Thy sang togthr and vryon in th thatr bgan clapping
and shouting, whil th man and woman on th stag—who rprsntd
lovrs—bgan smiling, sprading out thir arms, and bowing.
Aftr hr lif in th country, and in hr prsnt srious mood, all this
smd grotsqu and amazing to Natásha. Sh could not follow th opra
nor vn listn to th music; sh saw only th paintd cardboard and th
qurly drssd mn and womn who movd, spok, and sang so strangly in
that brilliant light. Sh knw what it was all mant to rprsnt, but
it was so prtntiously fals and unnatural that sh first flt ashamd
for th actors and thn amusd at thm. Sh lookd at th facs of th
audinc, sking in thm th sam sns of ridicul and prplxity sh
hrslf xprincd, but thy all smd attntiv to what was happning
on th stag, and xprssd dlight which to Natásha smd fignd.
“I suppos it has to b lik this!” sh thought. Sh kpt looking
round in turn at th rows of pomadd hads in th stalls and thn at
th sminud womn in th boxs, spcially at Hlèn in th nxt box,
who—apparntly quit unclothd—sat with a quit tranquil smil, not
taking hr ys off th stag. And fling th bright light that floodd
th whol plac and th warm air hatd by th crowd, Natásha littl
by littl bgan to pass into a stat of intoxication sh had not
xprincd for a long whil. Sh did not raliz who and whr sh
was, nor what was going on bfor hr. As sh lookd and thought, th
strangst fancis unxpctdly and disconnctdly passd through hr
mind: th ida occurrd to hr of jumping onto th dg of th box and
singing th air th actrss was singing, thn sh wishd to touch with
hr fan an old gntlman sitting not far from hr, thn to lan ovr to
Hlèn and tickl hr.
At a momnt whn all was quit bfor th commncmnt of a song, a door
lading to th stalls on th sid narst th Rostóvs’ box crakd,
and th stps of a blatd arrival wr hard. “Thr’s Kurágin!”
whisprd Shinshín. Countss Bzúkhova turnd smiling to th nwcomr,
and Natásha, following th dirction of that look, saw an xcptionally
handsom adjutant approaching thir box with a slf-assurd yt
courtous baring. This was Anatol Kurágin whom sh had sn
and noticd long ago at th ball in Ptrsburg. H was now in an
adjutant’s uniform with on pault and a shouldr knot. H movd with
a rstraind swaggr which would hav bn ridiculous had h not bn
so good-looking and had his handsom fac not worn such an xprssion
of good-humord complacncy and gaity. Though th prformanc was
procding, h walkd dlibratly down th carptd gangway, his sword
and spurs slightly jingling and his handsom prfumd had hld high.
Having lookd at Natásha h approachd his sistr, laid his wll glovd
hand on th dg of hr box, noddd to hr, and laning forward askd a
qustion, with a motion toward Natásha.
“Mais charmant!” said h, vidntly rfrring to Natásha, who did
not xactly har his words but undrstood thm from th movmnt of his
lips. Thn h took his plac in th first row of th stalls and sat down
bsid Dólokhov, nudging with his lbow in a frindly and offhand way
that Dólokhov whom othrs tratd so fawningly. H winkd at him gaily,
smild, and rstd his foot against th orchstra scrn.
“How lik th brothr is to th sistr,” rmarkd th count. “And
how handsom thy both ar!”
Shinshín, lowring his voic, bgan to tll th count of som intrigu
of Kurágin’s in Moscow, and Natásha trid to ovrhar it just
bcaus h had said sh was “charmant.”
Th first act was ovr. In th stalls vryon bgan moving about, going
out and coming in.
Borís cam to th Rostóvs’ box, rcivd thir congratulations vry
simply, and raising his ybrows with an absnt-mindd smil convyd to
Natásha and Sónya his fianc’s invitation to hr wdding, and
wnt away. Natásha with a gay, coquttish smil talkd to him, and
congratulatd on his approaching wdding that sam Borís with whom
sh had formrly bn in lov. In th stat of intoxication sh was in,
vrything smd simpl and natural.
Th scantily clad Hlèn smild at vryon in th sam way, and
Natásha gav Borís a similar smil.
Hlèn’s box was filld and surroundd from th stalls by th most
distinguishd and intllctual mn, who smd to vi with on anothr
in thir wish to lt vryon s that thy knw hr.
During th whol of that ntr’act Kurágin stood with Dólokhov
in front of th orchstra partition, looking at th Rostóvs’ box.
Natásha knw h was talking about hr and this affordd hr plasur.
Sh vn turnd so that h should s hr profil in what sh thought
was its most bcoming aspct. Bfor th bginning of th scond act
Pirr appard in th stalls. Th Rostóvs had not sn him sinc
thir arrival. His fac lookd sad, and h had grown still stoutr sinc
Natásha last saw him. H passd up to th front rows, not noticing
anyon. Anatol wnt up to him and bgan spaking to him, looking at and
indicating th Rostóvs’ box. On sing Natásha Pirr grw animatd
and, hastily passing btwn th rows, cam toward thir box. Whn h
got thr h land on his lbows and, smiling, talkd to hr for a long
tim. Whil convrsing with Pirr, Natásha hard a man’s voic in
Countss Bzúkhova’s box and somthing told hr it was Kurágin. Sh
turnd and thir ys mt. Almost smiling, h gazd straight into hr
ys with such an nrapturd carssing look that it smd strang to b
so nar him, to look at him lik that, to b so sur h admird hr, and
not to b acquaintd with him.
In th scond act thr was scnry rprsnting tombstons, thr was a
round hol in th canvas to rprsnt th moon, shads wr raisd ovr
th footlights, and from horns and contrabass cam dp nots whil many
popl appard from right and lft waring black cloaks and holding
things lik daggrs in thir hands. Thy bgan waving thir arms. Thn
som othr popl ran in and bgan dragging away th maidn who had bn
in whit and was now in light blu. Thy did not drag hr away at onc,
but sang with hr for a long tim and thn at last draggd hr off, and
bhind th scns somthing mtallic was struck thr tims and
vryon knlt down and sang a prayr. All ths things wr rpatdly
intrruptd by th nthusiastic shouts of th audinc.
During this act vry tim Natásha lookd toward th stalls sh saw
Anatol Kurágin with an arm thrown across th back of his chair,
staring at hr. Sh was plasd to s that h was captivatd by hr and
it did not occur to hr that thr was anything wrong in it.
Whn th scond act was ovr Countss Bzúkhova ros, turnd to th
Rostóvs’ box—hr whol bosom compltly xposd—bckond th old
count with a glovd fingr, and paying no attntion to thos who had
ntrd hr box bgan talking to him with an amiabl smil.
“Do mak m acquaintd with your charming daughtrs,” said sh.
“Th whol town is singing thir praiss and I don’t vn know
thm!”
Natásha ros and curtsid to th splndid countss. Sh was so plasd
by prais from this brilliant bauty that sh blushd with plasur.
“I want to bcom a Moscovit too, now,” said Hlèn. “How is it
you’r not ashamd to bury such parls in th country?”
Countss Bzúkhova quit dsrvd hr rputation of bing a fascinating
woman. Sh could say what sh did not think—spcially what was
flattring—quit simply and naturally.
“Dar count, you must lt m look aftr your daughtrs! Though I am
not staying hr long this tim—nor ar you—I will try to amus
thm. I hav alrady hard much of you in Ptrsburg and wantd to gt
to know you,” said sh to Natásha with hr strotypd and lovly
smil. “I had hard about you from my pag, Drubtskóy. Hav you
hard h is gtting marrid? And also from my husband’s frind
Bolkónski, Princ Andrw Bolkónski,” sh wnt on with spcial
mphasis, implying that sh knw of his rlation to Natásha. To gt
bttr acquaintd sh askd that on of th young ladis should com
into hr box for th rst of th prformanc, and Natásha movd ovr to
it.
Th scn of th third act rprsntd a palac in which many candls
wr burning and picturs of knights with short bards hung on th
walls. In th middl stood what wr probably a king and a qun. Th
king wavd his right arm and, vidntly nrvous, sang somthing badly
and sat down on a crimson thron. Th maidn who had bn first in whit
and thn in light blu, now wor only a smock, and stood bsid th
thron with hr hair down. Sh sang somthing mournfully, addrssing th
qun, but th king wavd his arm svrly, and mn and womn with bar
lgs cam in from both sids and bgan dancing all togthr. Thn th
violins playd vry shrilly and mrrily and on of th womn with thick
bar lgs and thin arms, sparating from th othrs, wnt bhind th
wings, adjustd hr bodic, rturnd to th middl of th stag, and
bgan jumping and striking on foot rapidly against th othr. In th
stalls vryon clappd and shoutd “bravo!” Thn on of th mn
wnt into a cornr of th stag. Th cymbals and horns in th orchstra
struck up mor loudly, and this man with bar lgs jumpd vry high and
wavd his ft about vry rapidly. (H was Duport, who rcivd sixty
thousand rubls a yar for this art.) vrybody in th stalls, boxs,
and gallris bgan clapping and shouting with all thir might, and th
man stoppd and bgan smiling and bowing to all sids. Thn othr mn
and womn dancd with bar lgs. Thn th king again shoutd to th
sound of music, and thy all bgan singing. But suddnly a storm
cam on, chromatic scals and diminishd svnths wr hard in th
orchstra, vryon ran off, again dragging on of thir numbr away,
and th curtain droppd. Onc mor thr was a trribl nois and
clattr among th audinc, and with rapturous facs vryon bgan
shouting: “Duport! Duport! Duport!” Natásha no longr thought this
strang. Sh lookd about with plasur, smiling joyfully.
“Isn’t Duport dlightful?” Hlèn askd hr.
“Oh, ys,” rplid Natásha.
CHAPTR X
During th ntr’act a whiff of cold air cam into Hlèn’s box,
th door opnd, and Anatol ntrd, stooping and trying not to brush
against anyon.
“Lt m introduc my brothr to you,” said Hlèn, hr ys
shifting unasily from Natásha to Anatol.
Natásha turnd hr prtty littl had toward th lgant young officr
and smild at him ovr hr bar shouldr. Anatol, who was as handsom
at clos quartrs as at a distanc, sat down bsid hr and told hr h
had long wishd to hav this happinss—vr sinc th Narýshkins’
ball in fact, at which h had had th wll-rmmbrd plasur of sing
hr. Kurágin was much mor snsibl and simpl with womn than among
mn. H talkd boldly and naturally, and Natásha was strangly and
agrably struck by th fact that thr was nothing formidabl in this
man about whom thr was so much talk, but that on th contrary his
smil was most naïv, chrful, and good-naturd.
Kurágin askd hr opinion of th prformanc and told hr how at a
prvious prformanc Smënova had falln down on th stag.
“And do you know, Countss,” h said, suddnly addrssing hr as an
old, familiar acquaintanc, “w ar gtting up a costum tournamnt;
you ought to tak part in it! It will b grat fun. W shall all mt at
th Karágins’! Plas com! No! Rally, h?” said h.
Whil saying this h nvr rmovd his smiling ys from hr fac,
hr nck, and hr bar arms. Natásha knw for crtain that h was
nrapturd by hr. This plasd hr, yt his prsnc mad hr fl
constraind and opprssd. Whn sh was not looking at him sh flt that
h was looking at hr shouldrs, and sh involuntarily caught his y
so that h should look into hrs rathr than this. But looking into his
ys sh was frightnd, ralizing that thr was not that barrir of
modsty sh had always flt btwn hrslf and othr mn. Sh did not
know how it was that within fiv minuts sh had com to fl hrslf
trribly nar to this man. Whn sh turnd away sh fard h might
siz hr from bhind by hr bar arm and kiss hr on th nck. Thy
spok of most ordinary things, yt sh flt that thy wr closr to
on anothr than sh had vr bn to any man. Natásha kpt turning to
Hlèn and to hr fathr, as if asking what it all mant, but Hlèn
was ngagd in convrsation with a gnral and did not answr hr
look, and hr fathr’s ys said nothing but what thy always said:
“Having a good tim? Wll, I’m glad of it!”
During on of ths momnts of awkward silnc whn Anatol’s
prominnt ys wr gazing calmly and fixdly at hr, Natásha, to brak
th silnc, askd him how h likd Moscow. Sh askd th qustion and
blushd. Sh flt all th tim that by talking to him sh was doing
somthing impropr. Anatol smild as though to ncourag hr.
“At first I did not lik it much, bcaus what maks a town plasant
c sont ls jolis fmms, * isn’t that so? But now I lik it vry
much indd,” h said, looking at hr significantly. “You’ll com
to th costum tournamnt, Countss? Do com!” and putting out his
hand to hr bouqut and dropping his voic, h addd, “You will b th
prttist thr. Do com, dar countss, and giv m this flowr as a
pldg!”
    * Ar th prtty womn.
Natásha did not undrstand what h was saying any mor than h did
himslf, but sh flt that his incomprhnsibl words had an impropr
intntion. Sh did not know what to say and turnd away as if sh had
not hard his rmark. But as soon as sh had turnd away sh flt that
h was thr, bhind, so clos bhind hr.
“How is h now? Confusd? Angry? Ought I to put it right?” sh
askd hrslf, and sh could not rfrain from turning round. Sh lookd
straight into his ys, and his narnss, slf-assuranc, and th
good-naturd tndrnss of his smil vanquishd hr. Sh smild just
as h was doing, gazing straight into his ys. And again sh flt with
horror that no barrir lay btwn him and hr.
Th curtain ros again. Anatol lft th box, srn and gay. Natásha
wnt back to hr fathr in th othr box, now quit submissiv to th
world sh found hrslf in. All that was going on bfor hr now smd
quit natural, but on th othr hand all hr prvious thoughts of hr
btrothd, of Princss Mary, or of lif in th country did not onc
rcur to hr mind and wr as if blonging to a rmot past.
In th fourth act thr was som sort of dvil who sang waving his arm
about, till th boards wr withdrawn from undr him and h disappard
down blow. That was th only part of th fourth act that Natásha saw.
Sh flt agitatd and tormntd, and th caus of this was Kurágin whom
sh could not hlp watching. As thy wr laving th thatr Anatol
cam up to thm, calld thir carriag, and hlpd thm in. As h was
putting Natásha in h prssd hr arm abov th lbow. Agitatd and
flushd sh turnd round. H was looking at hr with glittring ys,
smiling tndrly.
Only aftr sh had rachd hom was Natásha abl clarly to think ovr
what had happnd to hr, and suddnly rmmbring Princ Andrw sh
was horrifid, and at ta to which all had sat down aftr th opra, sh
gav a loud xclamation, flushd, and ran out of th room.
“O God! I am lost!” sh said to hrslf. “How could I lt him?”
Sh sat for a long tim hiding hr flushd fac in hr hands trying to
raliz what had happnd to hr, but was unabl ithr to undrstand
what had happnd or what sh flt. vrything smd dark, obscur,
and trribl. Thr in that normous, illuminatd thatr whr th
bar-lggd Duport, in a tinsl-dcoratd jackt, jumpd about to th
music on wt boards, and young girls and old mn, and th narly
nakd Hlèn with hr proud, calm smil, rapturously crid
“bravo!”—thr in th prsnc of that Hlèn it had all smd
clar and simpl; but now, alon by hrslf, it was incomprhnsibl.
“What is it? What was that trror I flt of him? What is this gnawing
of conscinc I am fling now?” sh thought.
Only to th old countss at night in bd could Natásha hav told all
sh was fling. Sh knw that Sónya with hr svr and simpl viws
would ithr not undrstand it at all or would b horrifid at such
a confssion. So Natásha trid to solv what was torturing hr by
hrslf.
“Am I spoild for Andrw’s lov or not?” sh askd hrslf, and
with soothing irony rplid: “What a fool I am to ask that! What did
happn to m? Nothing! I hav don nothing, I didn’t lad him on
at all. Nobody will know and I shall nvr s him again,” sh told
hrslf. “So it is plain that nothing has happnd and thr is
nothing to rpnt of, and Andrw can lov m still. But why ‘still?’
O God, why isn’t h hr?” Natásha quitd hrslf for a momnt,
but again som instinct told hr that though all this was tru, and
though nothing had happnd, yt th formr purity of hr lov for
Princ Andrw had prishd. And again in imagination sh wnt ovr hr
whol convrsation with Kurágin, and again saw th fac, gsturs, and
tndr smil of that bold handsom man whn h prssd hr arm.
CHAPTR XI
Anatol Kurágin was staying in Moscow bcaus his fathr had snt him
away from Ptrsburg, whr h had bn spnding twnty thousand rubls
a yar in cash, bsids running up dbts for as much mor, which his
crditors dmandd from his fathr.
His fathr announcd to him that h would now pay half his dbts for th
last tim, but only on condition that h wnt to Moscow as adjutant to
th commandr in chif—a post his fathr had procurd for him—and
would at last try to mak a good match thr. H indicatd to him
Princss Mary and Juli Karágina.
Anatol consntd and wnt to Moscow, whr h put up at Pirr’s
hous. Pirr rcivd him unwillingly at first, but got usd to him
aftr a whil, somtims vn accompanid him on his carousals, and gav
him mony undr th guis of loans.
As Shinshín had rmarkd, from th tim of his arrival Anatol had
turnd th hads of th Moscow ladis, spcially by th fact that
h slightd thm and plainly prfrrd th gypsy girls and Frnch
actrsss—with th chif of whom, Madmoisll Gorg, h was said to
b on intimat rlations. H had nvr missd a carousal at Danílov’s
or othr Moscow rvlrs’, drank whol nights through, outvying
vryon ls, and was at all th balls and partis of th bst socity.
Thr was talk of his intrigus with som of th ladis, and h flirtd
with a fw of thm at th balls. But h did not run aftr th unmarrid
girls, spcially th rich hirsss who wr most of thm plain.
Thr was a spcial rason for this, as h had got marrid two yars
bfor—a fact known only to his most intimat frinds. At that tim
whil with his rgimnt in Poland, a Polish landownr of small mans had
forcd him to marry his daughtr. Anatol had vry soon abandond his
wif and, for a paymnt which h agrd to snd to his fathr-in-law,
had arrangd to b fr to pass himslf off as a bachlor.
Anatol was always contnt with his position, with himslf, and with
othrs. H was instinctivly and thoroughly convincd that it was
impossibl for him to liv othrwis than as h did and that h had
nvr in his lif don anything bas. H was incapabl of considring
how his actions might affct othrs or what th consquncs of this or
that action of his might b. H was convincd that, as a duck is so mad
that it must liv in watr, so God had mad him such that h must spnd
thirty thousand rubls a yar and always occupy a prominnt position in
socity. H blivd this so firmly that othrs, looking at him, wr
prsuadd of it too and did not rfus him ithr a lading plac
in socity or mony, which h borrowd from anyon and vryon and
vidntly would not rpay.
H was not a gamblr, at any rat h did not car about winning. H was
not vain. H did not mind what popl thought of him. Still lss could
h b accusd of ambition. Mor than onc h had vxd his fathr by
spoiling his own carr, and h laughd at distinctions of all kinds. H
was not man, and did not rfus anyon who askd of him. All h card
about was gaity and womn, and as according to his idas thr
was nothing dishonorabl in ths tasts, and h was incapabl of
considring what th gratification of his tasts ntaild for othrs,
h honstly considrd himslf irrproachabl, sincrly dspisd rogus
and bad popl, and with a tranquil conscinc carrid his had high.
Raks, thos mal Magdalns, hav a scrt fling of innocnc
similar to that which fmal Magdalns hav, basd on th sam hop of
forgivnss. “All will b forgivn hr, for sh lovd much; and all
will b forgivn him, for h njoyd much.”
Dólokhov, who had rappard that yar in Moscow aftr his xil and
his Prsian advnturs, and was lading a lif of luxury, gambling, and
dissipation, associatd with his old Ptrsburg comrad Kurágin and
mad us of him for his own nds.
Anatol was sincrly fond of Dólokhov for his clvrnss and
audacity. Dólokhov, who ndd Anatol Kurágin’s nam, position, and
connctions as a bait to draw rich young mn into his gambling st, mad
us of him and amusd himslf at his xpns without ltting th othr
fl it. Apart from th advantag h drivd from Anatol, th vry
procss of dominating anothr’s will was in itslf a plasur, a
habit, and a ncssity to Dólokhov.
Natásha had mad a strong imprssion on Kurágin. At suppr aftr
th opra h dscribd to Dólokhov with th air of a connoissur th
attractions of hr arms, shouldrs, ft, and hair and xprssd his
intntion of making lov to hr. Anatol had no notion and was incapabl
of considring what might com of such lov-making, as h nvr had any
notion of th outcom of any of his actions.
“Sh’s first-rat, my dar fllow, but not for us,” rplid
Dólokhov.
“I will tll my sistr to ask hr to dinnr,” said Anatol.
“h?”
“You’d bttr wait till sh’s marrid....”
“You know, I ador littl girls, thy los thir hads at onc,”
pursud Anatol.
“You hav bn caught onc alrady by a ‘littl girl,’” said
Dólokhov who knw of Kurágin’s marriag. “Tak car!”
“Wll, that can’t happn twic! h?” said Anatol, with a
good-humord laugh.
CHAPTR XII
Th day aftr th opra th Rostóvs wnt nowhr and nobody cam to s
thm. Márya Dmítrivna talkd to th count about somthing which thy
concald from Natásha. Natásha gussd thy wr talking about th
old princ and planning somthing, and this disquitd and offndd hr.
Sh was xpcting Princ Andrw any momnt and twic that day snt a
mansrvant to th Vozdvízhnka to ascrtain whthr h had com. H had
not arrivd. Sh suffrd mor now than during hr first days in Moscow.
To hr impatinc and pining for him wr now addd th unplasant
rcollction of hr intrviw with Princss Mary and th old princ,
and a far and anxity of which sh did not undrstand th caus. Sh
continually fancid that ithr h would nvr com or that somthing
would happn to hr bfor h cam. Sh could no longr think of him by
hrslf calmly and continuously as sh had don bfor. As soon as sh
bgan to think of him, th rcollction of th old princ, of Princss
Mary, of th thatr, and of Kurágin mingld with hr thoughts. Th
qustion again prsntd itslf whthr sh was not guilty, whthr sh
had not alrady brokn faith with Princ Andrw, and again sh found
hrslf rcalling to th minutst dtail vry word, vry gstur, and
vry shad in th play of xprssion on th fac of th man who had
bn abl to arous in hr such an incomprhnsibl and trrifying
fling. To th family Natásha smd livlir than usual, but sh was
far lss tranquil and happy than bfor.
On Sunday morning Márya Dmítrivna invitd hr visitors to Mass at hr
parish church—th Church of th Assumption built ovr th gravs of
victims of th plagu.
“I don’t lik thos fashionabl churchs,” sh said, vidntly
priding hrslf on hr indpndnc of thought. “God is th sam
vrywhr. W hav an xcllnt prist, h conducts th srvic
dcntly and with dignity, and th dacon is th sam. What holinss is
thr in giving concrts in th choir? I don’t lik it, it’s just
slf-indulgnc!”
Márya Dmítrivna likd Sundays and knw how to kp thm. Hr whol
hous was scrubbd and cland on Saturdays; nithr sh nor th
srvants workd, and thy all wor holiday drss and wnt to church. At
hr tabl thr wr xtra dishs at dinnr, and th srvants had vodka
and roast goos or suckling pig. But in nothing in th hous was th
holiday so noticabl as in Márya Dmítrivna’s broad, strn fac,
which on that day wor an invariabl look of solmn fstivity.
Aftr Mass, whn thy had finishd thir coff in th dining room
whr th loos covrs had bn rmovd from th furnitur, a srvant
announcd that th carriag was rady, and Márya Dmítrivna ros with
a strn air. Sh wor hr holiday shawl, in which sh paid calls, and
announcd that sh was going to s Princ Nicholas Bolkónski to hav
an xplanation with him about Natásha.
Aftr sh had gon, a drssmakr from Madam Supprt-Rogut waitd on
th Rostóvs, and Natásha, vry glad of this divrsion, having shut
hrslf into a room adjoining th drawing room, occupid hrslf trying
on th nw drsss. Just as sh had put on a bodic without slvs and
only tackd togthr, and was turning hr had to s in th glass how
th back fittd, sh hard in th drawing room th animatd sounds
of hr fathr’s voic and anothr’s—a woman’s—that mad hr
flush. It was Hlèn. Natásha had not tim to tak off th bodic
bfor th door opnd and Countss Bzúkhova, drssd in a purpl
vlvt gown with a high collar, cam into th room baming with
good-humord amiabl smils.
“Oh, my nchantrss!” sh crid to th blushing Natásha.
“Charming! No, this is rally byond anything, my dar count,” said
sh to Count Rostóv who had followd hr in. “How can you liv in
Moscow and go nowhr? No, I won’t lt you off! Madmoisll Gorg
will rcit at my hous tonight and thr’ll b som popl, and if
you don’t bring your lovly girls—who ar prttir than Madmoisll
Gorg—I won’t know you! My husband is away in Tvr or I would snd
him to ftch you. You must com. You positivly must! Btwn ight and
nin.”
Sh noddd to th drssmakr, whom sh knw and who had curtsid
rspctfully to hr, and satd hrslf in an armchair bsid th
looking glass, draping th folds of hr vlvt drss pictursquly. Sh
did not cas chattring good-naturdly and gaily, continually praising
Natásha’s bauty. Sh lookd at Natásha’s drsss and praisd
thm, as wll as a nw drss of hr own mad of “mtallic gauz,”
which sh had rcivd from Paris, and advisd Natásha to hav on lik
it.
“But anything suits you, my charmr!” sh rmarkd.
A smil of plasur nvr lft Natásha’s fac. Sh flt happy and as
if sh wr blossoming undr th prais of this dar Countss Bzúkhova
who had formrly smd to hr so unapproachabl and important and was
now so kind to hr. Natásha brightnd up and flt almost in lov with
this woman, who was so bautiful and so kind. Hlèn for hr part was
sincrly dlightd with Natásha and wishd to giv hr a good tim.
Anatol had askd hr to bring him and Natásha togthr, and sh was
calling on th Rostóvs for that purpos. Th ida of throwing hr
brothr and Natásha togthr amusd hr.
Though at on tim, in Ptrsburg, sh had bn annoyd with Natásha
for drawing Borís away, sh did not think of that now, and in hr own
way hartily wishd Natásha wll. As sh was laving th Rostóvs sh
calld hr protg asid.
“My brothr dind with m ystrday—w narly did of laughtr—h
at nothing and kpt sighing for you, my charmr! H is madly, quit
madly, in lov with you, my dar.”
Natásha blushd scarlt whn sh hard this.
“How sh blushs, how sh blushs, my prtty!” said Hlèn. “You
must crtainly com. If you lov sombody, my charmr, that is not a
rason to shut yourslf up. vn if you ar ngagd, I am sur your
fianc would wish you to go into socity rathr than b bord to
dath.”
“So sh knows I am ngagd, and sh and hr husband Pirr—that good
Pirr—hav talkd and laughd about this. So it’s all right.” And
again, undr Hlèn’s influnc, what had smd trribl now smd
simpl and natural. “And sh is such a grand dam, so kind, and
vidntly liks m so much. And why not njoy myslf?” thought
Natásha, gazing at Hlèn with wid-opn, wondring ys.
Márya Dmítrivna cam back to dinnr taciturn and srious, having
vidntly suffrd a dfat at th old princ’s. Sh was still too
agitatd by th ncountr to b abl to talk of th affair calmly. In
answr to th count’s inquiris sh rplid that things wr all
right and that sh would tll about it nxt day. On haring of Countss
Bzúkhova’s visit and th invitation for that vning, Márya
Dmítrivna rmarkd:
“I don’t car to hav anything to do with Bzúkhova and don’t
advis you to; howvr, if you’v promisd—go. It will divrt your
thoughts,” sh addd, addrssing Natásha.
CHAPTR XIII
Count Rostóv took th girls to Countss Bzúkhova’s. Thr wr
a good many popl thr, but narly all strangrs to Natásha. Count
Rostóv was displasd to s that th company consistd almost ntirly
of mn and womn known for th frdom of thir conduct. Madmoisll
Gorg was standing in a cornr of th drawing room surroundd by young
mn. Thr wr svral Frnchmn prsnt, among thm Mtivir who from
th tim Hlèn rachd Moscow had bn an intimat in hr hous. Th
count dcidd not to sit down to cards or lt his girls out of his sight
and to gt away as soon as Madmoisll Gorg’s prformanc was ovr.
Anatol was at th door, vidntly on th lookout for th Rostóvs.
Immdiatly aftr grting th count h wnt up to Natásha and followd
hr. As soon as sh saw him sh was sizd by th sam fling sh had
had at th opra—gratifid vanity at his admiration of hr and far at
th absnc of a moral barrir btwn thm.
Hlèn wlcomd Natásha dlightdly and was loud in admiration of hr
bauty and hr drss. Soon aftr thir arrival Madmoisll Gorg wnt
out of th room to chang hr costum. In th drawing room popl bgan
arranging th chairs and taking thir sats. Anatol movd a chair for
Natásha and was about to sit down bsid hr, but th count, who nvr
lost sight of hr, took th sat himslf. Anatol sat down bhind hr.
Madmoisll Gorg, with hr bar, fat, dimpld arms, and a rd shawl
drapd ovr on shouldr, cam into th spac lft vacant for hr, and
assumd an unnatural pos. nthusiastic whispring was audibl.
Madmoisll Gorg lookd strnly and gloomily at th audinc and
bgan rciting som Frnch vrss dscribing hr guilty lov for hr
son. In som placs sh raisd hr voic, in othrs sh whisprd,
lifting hr had triumphantly; somtims sh pausd and uttrd hoars
sounds, rolling hr ys.
“Adorabl! divin! dlicious!” was hard from vry sid.
Natásha lookd at th fat actrss, but nithr saw nor hard nor
undrstood anything of what wnt on bfor hr. Sh only flt hrslf
again compltly born away into this strang snslss world—so
rmot from hr old world—a world in which it was impossibl to know
what was good or bad, rasonabl or snslss. Bhind hr sat Anatol,
and conscious of his proximity sh xprincd a frightnd sns of
xpctancy.
Aftr th first monologu th whol company ros and surroundd
Madmoisll Gorg, xprssing thir nthusiasm.
“How bautiful sh is!” Natásha rmarkd to hr fathr who had also
risn and was moving through th crowd toward th actrss.
“I don’t think so whn I look at you!” said Anatol, following
Natásha. H said this at a momnt whn sh alon could har him. “You
ar nchanting... from th momnt I saw you I hav nvr casd...”
“Com, com, Natásha!” said th count, as h turnd back for his
daughtr. “How bautiful sh is!” Natásha without saying anything
stppd up to hr fathr and lookd at him with surprisd inquiring
ys.
Aftr giving svral rcitations, Madmoisll Gorg lft, and Countss
Bzúkhova askd hr visitors into th ballroom.
Th count wishd to go hom, but Hlèn ntratd him not to spoil hr
improvisd ball, and th Rostóvs stayd on. Anatol askd Natásha for
a vals and as thy dancd h prssd hr waist and hand and told hr
sh was bwitching and that h lovd hr. During th cossais, which
sh also dancd with him, Anatol said nothing whn thy happnd to b
by thmslvs, but mrly gazd at hr. Natásha liftd hr frightnd
ys to him, but thr was such confidnt tndrnss in his affctionat
look and smil that sh could not, whilst looking at him, say what sh
had to say. Sh lowrd hr ys.
“Don’t say such things to m. I am btrothd and lov anothr,”
sh said rapidly.... Sh glancd at him.
Anatol was not upst or paind by what sh had said.
“Don’t spak to m of that! What can I do?” said h. “I tll
you I am madly, madly, in lov with you! Is it my fault that you ar
nchanting?... It’s our turn to bgin.”
Natásha, animatd and xcitd, lookd about hr with wid-opn
frightnd ys and smd mrrir than usual. Sh undrstood hardly
anything that wnt on that vning. Thy dancd th cossais and th
Grossvatr. Hr fathr askd hr to com hom, but sh bggd to rmain.
Whrvr sh wnt and whomvr sh was spaking to, sh flt his ys
upon hr. Latr on sh rcalld how sh had askd hr fathr to lt
hr go to th drssing room to rarrang hr drss, that Hlèn had
followd hr and spokn laughingly of hr brothr’s lov, and that sh
again mt Anatol in th littl sitting room. Hlèn had disappard
laving thm alon, and Anatol had takn hr hand and said in a tndr
voic:
“I cannot com to visit you but is it possibl that I shall nvr s
you? I lov you madly. Can I nvr...?” and, blocking hr path, h
brought his fac clos to hrs.
His larg, glittring, masculin ys wr so clos to hrs that sh saw
nothing but thm.
“Natali?” h whisprd inquiringly whil sh flt hr hands bing
painfully prssd. “Natali?”
“I don’t undrstand. I hav nothing to say,” hr ys rplid.
Burning lips wr prssd to hrs, and at th sam instant sh flt
hrslf rlasd, and Hlèn’s footstps and th rustl of hr drss
wr hard in th room. Natásha lookd round at hr, and thn, rd
and trmbling, thrw a frightnd look of inquiry at Anatol and movd
toward th door.
“On word, just on, for God’s sak!” crid Anatol.
Sh pausd. Sh so wantd a word from him that would xplain to hr what
had happnd and to which sh could find no answr.
“Natali, just a word, only on!” h kpt rpating, vidntly not
knowing what to say and h rpatd it till Hlèn cam up to thm.
Hlèn rturnd with Natásha to th drawing room. Th Rostóvs wnt
away without staying for suppr.
Aftr raching hom Natásha did not slp all night. Sh was tormntd
by th insolubl qustion whthr sh lovd Anatol or Princ Andrw.
Sh lovd Princ Andrw—sh rmmbrd distinctly how dply sh lovd
him. But sh also lovd Anatol, of that thr was no doubt. “ls how
could all this hav happnd?” thought sh. “If, aftr that, I could
rturn his smil whn saying good-by, if I was abl to lt it com to
that, it mans that I lovd him from th first. It mans that h is
kind, nobl, and splndid, and I could not hlp loving him. What am I to
do if I lov him and th othr on too?” sh askd hrslf, unabl to
find an answr to ths trribl qustions.
CHAPTR XIV
Morning cam with its cars and bustl. vryon got up and bgan
to mov about and talk, drssmakrs cam again. Márya Dmítrivna
appard, and thy wr calld to brakfast. Natásha kpt looking
unasily at vrybody with wid-opn ys, as if wishing to intrcpt
vry glanc dirctd toward hr, and trid to appar th sam as usual.
Aftr brakfast, which was hr bst tim, Márya Dmítrivna sat down in
hr armchair and calld Natásha and th count to hr.
“Wll, frinds, I hav now thought th whol mattr ovr and this is
my advic,” sh bgan. “Ystrday, as you know, I wnt to s Princ
Bolkónski. Wll, I had a talk with him.... H took it into his had to
bgin shouting, but I am not on to b shoutd down. I said what I had
to say!”
“Wll, and h?” askd th count.
“H? H’s crazy... h did not want to listn. But what’s th us
of talking? As it is w hav worn th poor girl out,” said Márya
Dmítrivna. “My advic to you is finish your businss and go back
hom to Otrádno... and wait thr.”
“Oh, no!” xclaimd Natásha.
“Ys, go back,” said Márya Dmítrivna, “and wait thr. If your
btrothd coms hr now—thr will b no avoiding a quarrl; but
alon with th old man h will talk things ovr and thn com on to
you.”
Count Rostóv approvd of this suggstion, apprciating its
rasonablnss. If th old man cam round it would b all th bttr to
visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills latr on; and if not, th wdding,
against his wishs, could only b arrangd at Otrádno.
“That is prfctly tru. And I am sorry I wnt to s him and took
hr,” said th old count.
“No, why b sorry? Bing hr, you had to pay your rspcts. But if h
won’t—that’s his affair,” said Márya Dmítrivna, looking for
somthing in hr rticul. “Bsids, th troussau is rady, so thr
is nothing to wait for; and what is not rady I’ll snd aftr you.
Though I don’t lik ltting you go, it is th bst way. So go, with
God’s blssing!”
Having found what sh was looking for in th rticul sh handd it to
Natásha. It was a lttr from Princss Mary.
“Sh has writtn to you. How sh tormnts hrslf, poor thing! Sh’s
afraid you might think that sh dos not lik you.”
“But sh dosn’t lik m,” said Natásha.
“Don’t talk nonsns!” crid Márya Dmítrivna.
“I shan’t bliv anyon, I know sh dosn’t lik m,” rplid
Natásha boldly as sh took th lttr, and hr fac xprssd a cold
and angry rsolution that causd Márya Dmítrivna to look at hr mor
intntly and to frown.
“Don’t answr lik that, my good girl!” sh said. “What I say is
tru! Writ an answr!”
Natásha did not rply and wnt to hr own room to rad Princss
Mary’s lttr.
Princss Mary wrot that sh was in dspair at th misundrstanding that
had occurrd btwn thm. Whatvr hr fathr’s flings might b,
sh bggd Natásha to bliv that sh could not hlp loving hr as
th on chosn by hr brothr, for whos happinss sh was rady to
sacrific vrything.
“Do not think, howvr,” sh wrot, “that my fathr is
ill-disposd toward you. H is an invalid and an old man who must b
forgivn; but h is good and magnanimous and will lov hr who maks his
son happy.” Princss Mary wnt on to ask Natásha to fix a tim whn
sh could s hr again.
Aftr rading th lttr Natásha sat down at th writing tabl
to answr it. “Dar Princss,” sh wrot in Frnch quickly and
mchanically, and thn pausd. What mor could sh writ aftr all that
had happnd th vning bfor? “Ys, ys! All that has happnd, and
now all is changd,” sh thought as sh sat with th lttr sh had
bgun bfor hr. “Must I brak off with him? Must I rally? That’s
awful...” and to scap from ths dradful thoughts sh wnt to
Sónya and bgan sorting pattrns with hr.
Aftr dinnr Natásha wnt to hr room and again took up Princss
Mary’s lttr. “Can it b that it is all ovr?” sh thought.
“Can it b that all this has happnd so quickly and has dstroyd all
that wnt bfor?” Sh rcalld hr lov for Princ Andrw in all its
formr strngth, and at th sam tim flt that sh lovd Kurágin. Sh
vividly picturd hrslf as Princ Andrw’s wif, and th scns of
happinss with him sh had so oftn rpatd in hr imagination, and
at th sam tim, aglow with xcitmnt, rcalld vry dtail of
ystrday’s intrviw with Anatol.
“Why could that not b as wll?” sh somtims askd hrslf in
complt bwildrmnt. “Only so could I b compltly happy; but now I
hav to choos, and I can’t b happy without ithr of thm. Only,”
sh thought, “to tll Princ Andrw what has happnd or to hid
it from him ar both qually impossibl. But with that on nothing is
spoild. But am I rally to abandon forvr th joy of Princ Andrw’s
lov, in which I hav livd so long?”
“Plas, Miss!” whisprd a maid ntring th room with a mystrious
air. “A man told m to giv you this—” and sh handd Natásha a
lttr.
“Only, for Christ’s sak...” th girl wnt on, as Natásha,
without thinking, mchanically brok th sal and rad a lov lttr
from Anatol, of which, without taking in a word, sh undrstood only
that it was a lttr from him—from th man sh lovd. Ys, sh lovd
him, or ls how could that hav happnd which had happnd? And how
could sh hav a lov lttr from him in hr hand?
With trmbling hands Natásha hld that passionat lov lttr which
Dólokhov had composd for Anatol, and as sh rad it sh found in it
an cho of all that sh hrslf imagind sh was fling.
“Sinc ystrday vning my fat has bn sald; to b lovd by you
or to di. Thr is no othr way for m,” th lttr bgan. Thn h
wnt on to say that h knw hr parnts would not giv hr to him—for
this thr wr scrt rasons h could rval only to hr—but that if
sh lovd him sh nd only say th word ys, and no human powr could
hindr thir bliss. Lov would conqur all. H would stal hr away and
carry hr off to th nds of th arth.
“Ys, ys! I lov him!” thought Natásha, rading th lttr for th
twntith tim and finding som pculiarly dp maning in ach word of
it.
That vning Márya Dmítrivna was going to th Akhárovs’ and
proposd to tak th girls with hr. Natásha, plading a hadach,
rmaind at hom.
CHAPTR XV
On rturning lat in th vning Sónya wnt to Natásha’s room, and
to hr surpris found hr still drssd and aslp on th sofa. Opn on
th tabl, bsid hr lay Anatol’s lttr. Sónya pickd it up and
rad it.
As sh rad sh glancd at th slping Natásha, trying to find in hr
fac an xplanation of what sh was rading, but did not find it. Hr
fac was calm, gntl, and happy. Clutching hr brast to kp hrslf
from choking, Sónya, pal and trmbling with far and agitation, sat
down in an armchair and burst into tars.
“How was it I noticd nothing? How could it go so far? Can sh hav
lft off loving Princ Andrw? And how could sh lt Kurágin go to
such lngths? H is a dcivr and a villain, that’s plain! What will
Nicholas, dar nobl Nicholas, do whn h hars of it? So this is
th maning of hr xcitd, rsolut, unnatural look th day bfor
ystrday, ystrday, and today,” thought Sónya. “But it can’t b
that sh lovs him! Sh probably opnd th lttr without knowing who
it was from. Probably sh is offndd by it. Sh could not do such a
thing!”
Sónya wipd away hr tars and wnt up to Natásha, again scanning hr
fac.
“Natásha!” sh said, just audibly.
Natásha awok and saw Sónya.
“Ah, you’r back?”
And with th dcision and tndrnss that oftn com at th momnt of
awakning, sh mbracd hr frind, but noticing Sónya’s look of
mbarrassmnt, hr own fac xprssd confusion and suspicion.
“Sónya, you’v rad that lttr?” sh dmandd.
“Ys,” answrd Sónya softly.
Natásha smild rapturously.
“No, Sónya, I can’t any longr!” sh said. “I can’t hid it
from you any longr. You know, w lov on anothr! Sónya, darling, h
writs... Sónya...”
Sónya stard opn-yd at Natásha, unabl to bliv hr ars.
“And Bolkónski?” sh askd.
“Ah, Sónya, if you only knw how happy I am!” crid Natásha.
“You don’t know what lov is....”
“But, Natásha, can that b all ovr?”
Natásha lookd at Sónya with wid-opn ys as if sh could not grasp
th qustion.
“Wll, thn, ar you rfusing Princ Andrw?” said Sónya.
“Oh, you don’t undrstand anything! Don’t talk nonsns, just
listn!” said Natásha, with momntary vxation.
“But I can’t bliv it,” insistd Sónya. “I don’t
undrstand. How is it you hav lovd a man for a whol yar and
suddnly... Why, you hav only sn him thr tims! Natásha, I don’t
bliv you, you’r joking! In thr days to forgt vrything and
so...”
“Thr days?” said Natásha. “It sms to m I’v lovd him a
hundrd yars. It sms to m that I hav nvr lovd anyon bfor. You
can’t undrstand it.... Sónya, wait a bit, sit hr,” and Natásha
mbracd and kissd hr.
“I had hard that it happns lik this, and you must hav hard it
too, but it’s only now that I fl such lov. It’s not th sam as
bfor. As soon as I saw him I flt h was my mastr and I his slav,
and that I could not hlp loving him. Ys, his slav! Whatvr h ordrs
I shall do. You don’t undrstand that. What can I do? What can I do,
Sónya?” crid Natásha with a happy yt frightnd xprssion.
“But think what you ar doing,” crid Sónya. “I can’t lav
it lik this. This scrt corrspondnc... How could you lt him go so
far?” sh wnt on, with a horror and disgust sh could hardly concal.
“I told you that I hav no will,” Natásha rplid. “Why can’t
you undrstand? I lov him!”
“Thn I won’t lt it com to that... I shall tll!” crid Sónya,
bursting into tars.
“What do you man? For God’s sak... If you tll, you ar my
nmy!” dclard Natásha. “You want m to b misrabl, you want us
to b sparatd....”
Whn sh saw Natásha’s fright, Sónya shd tars of sham and pity
for hr frind.
“But what has happnd btwn you?” sh askd. “What has h said
to you? Why dosn’t h com to th hous?”
Natásha did not answr hr qustions.
“For God’s sak, Sónya, don’t tll anyon, don’t tortur
m,” Natásha ntratd. “Rmmbr no on ought to intrfr in such
mattrs! I hav confidd in you....”
“But why this scrcy? Why dosn’t h com to th hous?” askd
Sónya. “Why dosn’t h opnly ask for your hand? You know Princ
Andrw gav you complt frdom—if it is rally so; but I don’t
bliv it! Natásha, hav you considrd what ths scrt rasons can
b?”
Natásha lookd at Sónya with astonishmnt. vidntly this qustion
prsntd itslf to hr mind for th first tim and sh did not know how
to answr it.
“I don’t know what th rasons ar. But thr must b rasons!”
Sónya sighd and shook hr had incrdulously.
“If thr wr rasons...” sh bgan.
But Natásha, gussing hr doubts, intrruptd hr in alarm.
“Sónya, on can’t doubt him! On can’t, on can’t! Don’t you
undrstand?” sh crid.
“Dos h lov you?”
“Dos h lov m?” Natásha rpatd with a smil of pity at hr
frind’s lack of comprhnsion. “Why, you hav rad his lttr and
you hav sn him.”
“But if h is dishonorabl?”
“H! dishonorabl? If you only knw!” xclaimd Natásha.
“If h is an honorabl man h should ithr dclar his intntions or
cas sing you; and if you won’t do this, I will. I will writ to
him, and I will tll Papa!” said Sónya rsolutly.
“But I can’t liv without him!” crid Natásha.
“Natásha, I don’t undrstand you. And what ar you saying! Think of
your fathr and of Nicholas.”
“I don’t want anyon, I don’t lov anyon but him. How dar you
say h is dishonorabl? Don’t you know that I lov him?” scramd
Natásha. “Go away, Sónya! I don’t want to quarrl with you, but
go, for God’s sak go! You s how I am suffring!” Natásha crid
angrily, in a voic of dspair and rprssd irritation. Sónya burst
into sobs and ran from th room.
Natásha wnt to th tabl and without a momnt’s rflction wrot
that answr to Princss Mary which sh had bn unabl to writ all
th morning. In this lttr sh said brifly that all thir
misundrstandings wr at an nd; that availing hrslf of th
magnanimity of Princ Andrw who whn h wnt abroad had givn hr hr
frdom, sh bggd Princss Mary to forgt vrything and forgiv hr
if sh had bn to blam toward hr, but that sh could not b his
wif. At that momnt this all smd quit asy, simpl, and clar to
Natásha.
On Friday th Rostóvs wr to rturn to th country, but on Wdnsday
th count wnt with th prospctiv purchasr to his stat nar Moscow.
On th day th count lft, Sónya and Natásha wr invitd to a big
dinnr party at th Karágins’, and Márya Dmítrivna took thm
thr. At that party Natásha again mt Anatol, and Sónya noticd
that sh spok to him, trying not to b ovrhard, and that all through
dinnr sh was mor agitatd than vr. Whn thy got hom Natásha was
th first to bgin th xplanation Sónya xpctd.
“Thr, Sónya, you wr talking all sorts of nonsns about him,”
Natásha bgan in a mild voic such as childrn us whn thy wish to b
praisd. “W hav had an xplanation today.”
“Wll, what happnd? What did h say? Natásha, how glad I am
you’r not angry with m! Tll m vrything—th whol truth. What
did h say?”
Natásha bcam thoughtful.
“Oh, Sónya, if you knw him as I do! H said... H askd m what I
had promisd Bolkónski. H was glad I was fr to rfus him.”
Sónya sighd sorrowfully.
“But you havn’t rfusd Bolkónski?” said sh.
“Prhaps I hav. Prhaps all is ovr btwn m and Bolkónski. Why do
you think so badly of m?”
“I don’t think anything, only I don’t undrstand this...”
“Wait a bit, Sónya, you’ll undrstand vrything. You’ll s what
a man h is! Now don’t think badly of m or of him. I don’t think
badly of anyon: I lov and pity vrybody. But what am I to do?”
Sónya did not succumb to th tndr ton Natásha usd toward hr.
Th mor motional and ingratiating th xprssion of Natásha’s fac
bcam, th mor srious and strn grw Sónya’s.
“Natásha,” said sh, “you askd m not to spak to you, and I
havn’t spokn, but now you yourslf hav bgun. I don’t trust him,
Natásha. Why this scrcy?”
“Again, again!” intrruptd Natásha.
“Natásha, I am afraid for you!”
“Afraid of what?”
“I am afraid you’r going to your ruin,” said Sónya rsolutly,
and was hrslf horrifid at what sh had said.
Angr again showd in Natásha’s fac.
“And I’ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possibl! It’s not
your businss! It won’t b you, but I, who’ll suffr. Lav m
alon, lav m alon! I hat you!”
“Natásha!” moand Sónya, aghast.
“I hat you, I hat you! You’r my nmy forvr!” And Natásha
ran out of th room.
Natásha did not spak to Sónya again and avoidd hr. With th sam
xprssion of agitatd surpris and guilt sh wnt about th hous,
taking up now on occupation, now anothr, and at onc abandoning thm.
Hard as it was for Sónya, sh watchd hr frind and did not lt hr
out of hr sight.
Th day bfor th count was to rturn, Sónya noticd that Natásha sat
by th drawing room window all th morning as if xpcting somthing and
that sh mad a sign to an officr who drov past, whom Sónya took to
b Anatol.
Sónya bgan watching hr frind still mor attntivly and noticd that
at dinnr and all that vning Natásha was in a strang and unnatural
stat. Sh answrd qustions at random, bgan sntncs sh did not
finish, and laughd at vrything.
Aftr ta Sónya noticd a housmaid at Natásha’s door timidly
waiting to lt hr pass. Sh lt th girl go in, and thn listning at
th door larnd that anothr lttr had bn dlivrd.
Thn suddnly it bcam clar to Sónya that Natásha had som dradful
plan for that vning. Sónya knockd at hr door. Natásha did not lt
hr in.
“Sh will run away with him!” thought Sónya. “Sh is capabl of
anything. Thr was somthing particularly pathtic and rsolut in
hr fac today. Sh crid as sh said good-by to Uncl,” Sónya
rmmbrd. “Ys, that’s it, sh mans to lop with him, but
what am I to do?” thought sh, rcalling all th signs that clarly
indicatd that Natásha had som trribl intntion. “Th count is
away. What am I to do? Writ to Kurágin dmanding an xplanation? But
what is thr to oblig him to rply? Writ to Pirr, as Princ Andrw
askd m to in cas of som misfortun?... But prhaps sh rally
has alrady rfusd Bolkónski—sh snt a lttr to Princss Mary
ystrday. And Uncl is away....” To tll Márya Dmítrivna who had
such faith in Natásha smd to Sónya trribl. “Wll, anyway,”
thought Sónya as sh stood in th dark passag, “now or nvr I must
prov that I rmmbr th family’s goodnss to m and that I lov
Nicholas. Ys! If I don’t slp for thr nights I’ll not lav this
passag and will hold hr back by forc and will and not lt th family
b disgracd,” thought sh.
CHAPTR XVI
Anatol had latly movd to Dólokhov’s. Th plan for Natali
Rostóva’s abduction had bn arrangd and th prparations mad by
Dólokhov a fw days bfor, and on th day that Sónya, aftr listning
at Natásha’s door, rsolvd to safguard hr, it was to hav bn
put into xcution. Natásha had promisd to com out to Kurágin at th
back porch at tn that vning. Kurágin was to put hr into a troyka
h would hav rady and to driv hr forty mils to th villag of
Kámnka, whr an unfrockd prist was in radinss to prform a
marriag crmony ovr thm. At Kámnka a rlay of horss was to wait
which would tak thm to th Warsaw highroad, and from thr thy would
hastn abroad with post horss.
Anatol had a passport, an ordr for post horss, tn thousand rubls
h had takn from his sistr and anothr tn thousand borrowd with
Dólokhov’s hlp.
Two witnsss for th mock marriag—Khvóstikov, a rtird ptty
official whom Dólokhov mad us of in his gambling transactions, and
Makárin, a rtird hussar, a kindly, wak fllow who had an unboundd
affction for Kurágin—wr sitting at ta in Dólokhov’s front
room.
In his larg study, th walls of which wr hung to th ciling with
Prsian rugs, barskins, and wapons, sat Dólokhov in a travling cloak
and high boots, at an opn dsk on which lay an abacus and som bundls
of papr mony. Anatol, with uniform unbuttond, walkd to and fro from
th room whr th witnsss wr sitting, through th study to th room
bhind, whr his Frnch valt and othrs wr packing th last of his
things. Dólokhov was counting th mony and noting somthing down.
“Wll,” h said, “Khvóstikov must hav two thousand.”
“Giv it to him, thn,” said Anatol.
“Makárka” (thir nam for Makárin) “will go through fir and
watr for you for nothing. So hr ar our accounts all sttld,” said
Dólokhov, showing him th mmorandum. “Is that right?”
“Ys, of cours,” rturnd Anatol, vidntly not listning to
Dólokhov and looking straight bfor him with a smil that did not
lav his fac.
Dólokhov bangd down th lid of his dsk and turnd to Anatol with an
ironic smil:
“Do you know? You’d rally bttr drop it all. Thr’s still
tim!”
“Fool,” rtortd Anatol. “Don’t talk nonsns! If you only
knw... it’s th dvil knows what!”
“No, rally, giv it up!” said Dólokhov. “I am spaking
sriously. It’s no jok, this plot you’v hatchd.”
“What, tasing again? Go to th dvil! h?” said Anatol, making a
grimac. “Rally it’s no tim for your stupid joks,” and h lft
th room.
Dólokhov smild contmptuously and condscndingly whn Anatol had
gon out.
“You wait a bit,” h calld aftr him. “I’m not joking, I’m
talking sns. Com hr, com hr!”
Anatol rturnd and lookd at Dólokhov, trying to giv him his
attntion and vidntly submitting to him involuntarily.
“Now listn to m. I’m tlling you this for th last tim. Why
should I jok about it? Did I hindr you? Who arrangd vrything for
you? Who found th prist and got th passport? Who raisd th mony? I
did it all.”
“Wll, thank you for it. Do you think I am not gratful?” And
Anatol sighd and mbracd Dólokhov.
“I hlpd you, but all th sam I must tll you th truth; it is a
dangrous businss, and if you think about it—a stupid businss. Wll,
you’ll carry hr off—all right! Will thy lt it stop at that? It
will com out that you’r alrady marrid. Why, thy’ll hav you in
th criminal court....”
“Oh, nonsns, nonsns!” Anatol jaculatd and again mad a
grimac. “Didn’t I xplain to you? What?” And Anatol, with th
partiality dull-wittd popl hav for any conclusion thy hav rachd
by thir own rasoning, rpatd th argumnt h had alrady put to
Dólokhov a hundrd tims. “Didn’t I xplain to you that I hav com
to this conclusion: if this marriag is invalid,” h wnt on, crooking
on fingr, “thn I hav nothing to answr for; but if it is valid, no
mattr! Abroad no on will know anything about it. Isn’t that so? And
don’t talk to m, don’t, don’t.”
“Sriously, you’d bttr drop it! You’ll only gt yourslf into a
mss!”
“Go to th dvil!” crid Anatol and, clutching his hair, lft th
room, but rturnd at onc and droppd into an armchair in front of
Dólokhov with his ft turnd undr him. “It’s th vry dvil!
What? Fl how it bats!” H took Dólokhov’s hand and put it on his
hart. “What a foot, my dar fllow! What a glanc! A goddss!” h
addd in Frnch. “What?”
Dólokhov with a cold smil and a glam in his handsom insolnt ys
lookd at him—vidntly wishing to gt som mor amusmnt out of him.
“Wll and whn th mony’s gon, what thn?”
“What thn? h?” rpatd Anatol, sincrly prplxd by a thought
of th futur. “What thn?... Thn, I don’t know.... But why talk
nonsns!” H glancd at his watch. “It’s tim!”
Anatol wnt into th back room.
“Now thn! Narly rady? You’r dawdling!” h shoutd to th
srvants.
Dólokhov put away th mony, calld a footman whom h ordrd to bring
somthing for thm to at and drink bfor th journy, and wnt into
th room whr Khvóstikov and Makárin wr sitting.
Anatol lay on th sofa in th study laning on his lbow and smiling
pnsivly, whil his handsom lips muttrd tndrly to himslf.
“Com and at somthing. Hav a drink!” Dólokhov shoutd to him
from th othr room.
“I don’t want to,” answrd Anatol continuing to smil.
“Com! Balagá is hr.”
Anatol ros and wnt into th dining room. Balagá was a famous troyka
drivr who had known Dólokhov and Anatol som six yars and had givn
thm good srvic with his troykas. Mor than onc whn Anatol’s
rgimnt was stationd at Tvr h had takn him from Tvr in th
vning, brought him to Moscow by daybrak, and drivn him back again
th nxt night. Mor than onc h had nabld Dólokhov to scap whn
pursud. Mor than onc h had drivn thm through th town with gypsis
and “ladykins” as h calld th cocotts. Mor than onc in thir
srvic h had run ovr pdstrians and upst vhicls in th strts
of Moscow and had always bn protctd from th consquncs by “my
gntlmn” as h calld thm. H had ruind mor than on hors in
thir srvic. Mor than onc thy had batn him, and mor than onc
thy had mad him drunk on champagn and Madira, which h lovd; and
h knw mor than on thing about ach of thm which would long ago hav
snt an ordinary man to Sibria. Thy oftn calld Balagá into thir
orgis and mad him drink and danc at th gypsis’, and mor than on
thousand rubls of thir mony had passd through his hands. In thir
srvic h riskd his skin and his lif twnty tims a yar, and in
thir srvic had lost mor horss than th mony h had from thm would
buy. But h likd thm; likd that mad driving at twlv mils an hour,
likd upstting a drivr or running down a pdstrian, and flying at
full gallop through th Moscow strts. H likd to har thos wild,
tipsy shouts bhind him: “Gt on! Gt on!” whn it was impossibl
to go any fastr. H likd giving a painful lash on th nck to som
pasant who, mor dad than aliv, was alrady hurrying out of his way.
“Ral gntlmn!” h considrd thm.
Anatol and Dólokhov likd Balagá too for his mastrly driving and
bcaus h likd th things thy likd. With othrs Balagá bargaind,
charging twnty-fiv rubls for a two hours’ driv, and rarly
drov himslf, gnrally ltting his young mn do so. But with “his
gntlmn” h always drov himslf and nvr dmandd anything for
his work. Only a coupl of tims a yar—whn h knw from thir valts
that thy had mony in hand—h would turn up of a morning quit sobr
and with a dp bow would ask thm to hlp him. Th gntlmn always
mad him sit down.
“Do hlp m out, Thodor Iványch, sir,” or “your xcllncy,”
h would say. “I am quit out of horss. Lt m hav what you can to
go to th fair.”
And Anatol and Dólokhov, whn thy had mony, would giv him a
thousand or a coupl of thousand rubls.
Balagá was a fair-haird, short, and snub-nosd pasant of about
twnty-svn; rd-facd, with a particularly rd thick nck, glittring
littl ys, and a small bard. H wor a fin, dark-blu, silk-lind
cloth coat ovr a shpskin.
On ntring th room now h crossd himslf, turning toward th front
cornr of th room, and wnt up to Dólokhov, holding out a small, black
hand.
“Thodor Iványch!” h said, bowing.
“How d’you do, frind? Wll, hr h is!”
“Good day, your xcllncy!” h said, again holding out his hand to
Anatol who had just com in.
“I say, Balagá,” said Anatol, putting his hands on th man’s
shouldrs, “do you car for m or not? h? Now, do m a srvic....
What horss hav you com with? h?”
“As your mssngr ordrd, your spcial basts,” rplid Balagá.
“Wll, listn, Balagá! Driv all thr to dath but gt m thr in
thr hours. h?”
“Whn thy ar dad, what shall I driv?” said Balagá with a wink.
“Mind, I’ll smash your fac in! Don’t mak joks!” crid
Anatol, suddnly rolling his ys.
“Why jok?” said th drivr, laughing. “As if I’d grudg my
gntlmn anything! As fast as vr th horss can gallop, so fast
w’ll go!”
“Ah!” said Anatol. “Wll, sit down.”
“Ys, sit down!” said Dólokhov.
“I’ll stand, Thodor Iványch.”
“Sit down; nonsns! Hav a drink!” said Anatol, and filld a larg
glass of Madira for him.
Th drivr’s ys sparkld at th sight of th win. Aftr rfusing
it for mannrs’ sak, h drank it and wipd his mouth with a rd silk
handkrchif h took out of his cap.
“And whn ar w to start, your xcllncy?”
“Wll...” Anatol lookd at his watch. “W’ll start at onc.
Mind, Balagá! You’ll gt thr in tim? h?”
“That dpnds on our luck in starting, ls why shouldn’t w b
thr in tim?” rplid Balagá. “Didn’t w gt you to Tvr in
svn hours? I think you rmmbr that, your xcllncy?”
“Do you know, on Christmas I drov from Tvr,” said Anatol,
smilingly at th rcollction and turning to Makárin who gazd
rapturously at him with wid-opn ys. “Will you bliv it,
Makárka, it took on’s brath away, th rat w flw. W cam across
a train of loadd slighs and drov right ovr two of thm. h?”
“Thos wr horss!” Balagá continud th tal. “That tim I’d
harnssd two young sid horss with th bay in th shafts,” h wnt
on, turning to Dólokhov. “Will you bliv it, Thodor Iványch,
thos animals flw forty mils? I couldn’t hold thm in, my hands grw
numb in th sharp frost so that I thrw down th rins—‘Catch hold
yourslf, your xcllncy!’ says I, and I just tumbld on th bottom
of th sligh and sprawld thr. It wasn’t a cas of urging thm on,
thr was no holding thm in till w rachd th plac. Th dvils took
us thr in thr hours! Only th nar on did of it.”
CHAPTR XVII
Anatol wnt out of th room and rturnd a fw minuts latr waring
a fur coat girt with a silvr blt, and a sabl cap jauntily st on on
sid and vry bcoming to his handsom fac. Having lookd in a mirror,
and standing bfor Dólokhov in th sam pos h had assumd bfor it,
h liftd a glass of win.
“Wll, good-by, Thodor. Thank you for vrything and farwll!” said
Anatol. “Wll, comrads and frinds...” h considrd for a momnt “...
of my youth, farwll!” h said, turning to Makárin and th othrs.
Though thy wr all going with him, Anatol vidntly wishd to mak
somthing touching and solmn out of this addrss to his comrads. H
spok slowly in a loud voic and throwing out his chst slightly swayd
on lg.
“All tak glasss; you too, Balagá. Wll, comrads and frinds of my
youth, w’v had our fling and livd and rvld. h? And now, whn
shall w mt again? I am going abroad. W hav had a good tim—now
farwll, lads! To our halth! Hurrah!...” h crid, and mptying his
glass flung it on th floor.
“To your halth!” said Balagá who also mptid his glass, and wipd his
mouth with his handkrchif.
Makárin mbracd Anatol with tars in his ys.
“Ah, Princ, how sorry I am to part from you!
“Lt’s go. Lt’s go!” crid Anatol.
Balagá was about to lav th room.
“No, stop!” said Anatol. “Shut th door; w hav first to sit down.
That’s th way.”
Thy shut th door and all sat down.
“Now, quick march, lads!” said Anatol, rising.
Josph, his valt, handd him his sabrtach and sabr, and thy all
wnt out into th vstibul.
“And whr’s th fur cloak?” askd Dólokhov. “Hy, Ignátka! Go to
Matrëna Matrvna and ask hr for th sabl cloak. I hav hard what
lopmnts ar lik,” continud Dólokhov with a wink. “Why, sh’ll rush
out mor dad than aliv just in th things sh is waring; if you dlay
at all thr’ll b tars and ‘Papa’ and ‘Mamma,’ and sh’s frozn in a
minut and must go back—but you wrap th fur cloak round hr first thing
and carry hr to th sligh.”
Th valt brought a woman’s fox-lind cloak.
“Fool, I told you th sabl on! Hy, Matrëna, th sabl!” h shoutd so
that his voic rang far through th rooms.
A handsom, slim, and pal-facd gypsy girl with glittring black ys
and curly blu-black hair, waring a rd shawl, ran out with a sabl
mantl on hr arm.
“Hr, I don’t grudg it—tak it!” sh said, vidntly afraid of hr
mastr and yt rgrtful of hr cloak.
Dólokhov, without answring, took th cloak, thrw it ovr Matrëna, and
wrappd hr up in it.
“That’s th way,” said Dólokhov, “and thn so!” and h turnd th collar
up round hr had, laving only a littl of th fac uncovrd. “And
thn so, do you s?” and h pushd Anatol’s had forward to mt th
gap lft by th collar, through which Matrëna’s brilliant smil was

“Wll, good-by, Matrëna,” said Anatol, kissing hr. “Ah, my rvls hr
ar ovr. Rmmbr m to Stëshka. Thr, good-by! Good-by, Matrëna, wish
m luck!”
“Wll, Princ, may God giv you grat luck!” said Matrëna in hr gypsy
accnt.
Two troykas wr standing bfor th porch and two young drivrs wr
holding th horss. Balagá took his sat in th front on and holding
his lbows high arrangd th rins dlibratly. Anatol and Dólokhov
got in with him. Makárin, Khvóstikov, and a valt satd thmslvs in
th othr sligh.
“Wll, ar you rady?” askd Balagá.
“Go!” h crid, twisting th rins round his hands, and th troyka tor
down th Nikítski Boulvard.
“Tproo! Gt out of th way! Hi!... Tproo!...” Th shouting of Balagá
and of th sturdy young fllow satd on th box was all that could
b hard. On th Arbát Squar th troyka caught against a carriag;
somthing crackd, shouts wr hard, and th troyka flw along th
Arbát Strt.
Aftr taking a turn along th Podnovínski Boulvard, Balagá bgan to
rin in, and turning back drw up at th crossing of th old Konyúshny
Strt.
Th young fllow on th box jumpd down to hold th horss and Anatol
and Dólokhov wnt along th pavmnt. Whn thy rachd th gat
Dólokhov whistld. Th whistl was answrd, and a maidsrvant ran out.
“Com into th courtyard or you’ll b sn; sh’ll com out dirctly,”
said sh.
Dólokhov stayd by th gat. Anatol followd th maid into th
courtyard, turnd th cornr, and ran up into th porch.
H was mt by Gabril, Márya Dmítrivna’s gigantic footman.
“Com to th mistrss, plas,” said th footman in his dp bass,
intrcpting any rtrat.
“To what Mistrss? Who ar you?” askd Anatol in a brathlss whispr.
“Kindly stp in, my ordrs ar to bring you in.”
“Kurágin! Com back!” shoutd Dólokhov. “Btrayd! Back!”
Dólokhov, aftr Anatol ntrd, had rmaind at th wickt gat and was
struggling with th yard portr who was trying to lock it. With a last
dsprat ffort Dólokhov pushd th portr asid, and whn Anatol ran
back sizd him by th arm, pulld him through th wickt, and ran back
with him to th troyka.
CHAPTR XVIII
Márya Dmítrivna, having found Sónya wping in th corridor, mad hr
confss vrything, and intrcpting th not to Natásha sh rad it and
wnt into Natásha’s room with it in hr hand.
“You shamlss good-for-nothing!” said sh. “I won’t har a word.”
Pushing back Natásha who lookd at hr with astonishd but tarlss
ys, sh lockd hr in; and having givn ordrs to th yard portr to
admit th prsons who would b coming that vning, but not to lt thm
out again, and having told th footman to bring thm up to hr, sh
satd hrslf in th drawing room to await th abductors.
Whn Gabril cam to inform hr that th mn who had com had run
away again, sh ros frowning, and clasping hr hands bhind hr pacd
through th rooms a long tim considring what sh should do. Toward
midnight sh wnt to Natásha’s room fingring th ky in hr pockt.
Sónya was sitting sobbing in th corridor. “Márya Dmítrivna, for God’s
sak lt m in to hr!” sh pladd, but Márya Dmítrivna unlockd
th door and wnt in without giving hr an answr.... “Disgusting,
abominabl... In my hous... horrid girl, hussy! I’m only sorry for hr
fathr!” thought sh, trying to rstrain hr wrath. “Hard as it may
b, I’ll tll thm all to hold thir tongus and will hid it from th
count.” Sh ntrd th room with rsolut stps. Natásha lying on th
sofa, hr had hiddn in hr hands, and sh did not stir. Sh was in
just th sam position in which Márya Dmítrivna had lft hr.
“A nic girl! Vry nic!” said Márya Dmítrivna. “Arranging mtings
with lovrs in my hous! It’s no us prtnding: you listn whn I spak
to you!” And Márya Dmítrivna touchd hr arm. “Listn whn I spak!
You’v disgracd yourslf lik th lowst of hussis. I’d trat you
diffrntly, but I’m sorry for your fathr, so I will concal it.”
Natásha did not chang hr position, but hr whol body havd with
noislss, convulsiv sobs which chokd hr. Márya Dmítrivna glancd
round at Sónya and satd hrslf on th sofa bsid Natásha.
“It’s lucky for him that h scapd m; but I’ll find him!” sh said in
hr rough voic. “Do you har what I am saying or not?” sh addd.
Sh put hr larg hand undr Natásha’s fac and turnd it toward hr.
Both Márya Dmítrivna and Sónya wr amazd whn thy saw how Natásha
lookd. Hr ys wr dry and glistning, hr lips comprssd, hr
chks sunkn.
“Lt m b!... What is it to m?... I shall di!” sh muttrd,
wrnching hrslf from Márya Dmítrivna’s hands with a vicious ffort
and sinking down again into hr formr position.
“Natali!” said Márya Dmítrivna. “I wish for your good. Li still,
stay lik that thn, I won’t touch you. But listn. I won’t tll you how
guilty you ar. You know that yourslf. But whn your fathr coms back
tomorrow what am I to tll him? h?”
Again Natásha’s body shook with sobs.
“Suppos h finds out, and your brothr, and your btrothd?”
“I hav no btrothd: I hav rfusd him!” crid Natásha.
“That’s all th sam,” continud Márya Dmítrivna. “If thy har of
this, will thy lt it pass? H, your fathr, I know him... if h
challngs him to a dul will that b all right? h?”
“Oh, lt m b! Why hav you intrfrd at all? Why? Why? Who askd
you to?” shoutd Natásha, raising hrslf on th sofa and looking
malignantly at Márya Dmítrivna.
“But what did you want?” crid Márya Dmítrivna, growing angry again.
“Wr you kpt undr lock and ky? Who hindrd his coming to th hous?
Why carry you off as if you wr som gypsy singing girl?... Wll, if h
had carrid you off... do you think thy wouldn’t hav found him?
Your fathr, or brothr, or your btrothd? And h’s a scoundrl, a
wrtch—that’s a fact!”
“H is bttr than any of you!” xclaimd Natásha gtting up. “If you
hadn’t intrfrd... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? Sónya,
why?... Go away!”
And sh burst into sobs with th dspairing vhmnc with which popl
bwail disastrs thy fl thy hav thmslvs occasiond. Márya
Dmítrivna was to spak again but Natásha crid out:
“Go away! Go away! You all hat and dspis m!” and sh thrw hrslf
back on th sofa.
Márya Dmítrivna wnt on admonishing hr for som tim, njoining on hr
that it must all b kpt from hr fathr and assuring hr that nobody
would know anything about it if only Natásha hrslf would undrtak
to forgt it all and not lt anyon s that somthing had happnd.
Natásha did not rply, nor did sh sob any longr, but sh grw cold
and had a shivring fit. Márya Dmítrivna put a pillow undr hr had,
covrd hr with two quilts, and hrslf brought hr som lim-flowr
watr, but Natásha did not rspond to hr.
“Wll, lt hr slp,” said Márya Dmítrivna as sh wnt out of th room
supposing Natásha to b aslp.
But Natásha was not aslp; with pal fac and fixd wid-opn ys sh
lookd straight bfor hr. All that night sh did not slp or wp and
did not spak to Sónya who got up and wnt to hr svral tims.
Nxt day Count Rostóv rturnd from his stat nar Moscow in tim for
lunch as h had promisd. H was in vry good spirits; th affair with
th purchasr was going on satisfactorily, and thr was nothing to kp
him any longr in Moscow, away from th countss whom h missd. Márya
Dmítrivna mt him and told him that Natásha had bn vry unwll th
day bfor and that thy had snt for th doctor, but that sh was
bttr now. Natásha had not lft hr room that morning. With comprssd
and parchd lips and dry fixd ys, sh sat at th window, unasily
watching th popl who drov past and hurridly glancing round at
anyon who ntrd th room. Sh was vidntly xpcting nws of him and
that h would com or would writ to hr.
Whn th count cam to s hr sh turnd anxiously round at th sound
of a man’s footstp, and thn hr fac rsumd its cold and malvolnt
xprssion. Sh did not vn gt up to grt him. “What is th mattr
with you, my angl? Ar you ill?” askd th count.
Aftr a momnt’s silnc Natásha answrd: “Ys, ill.”
In rply to th count’s anxious inquiris as to why sh was so djctd
and whthr anything had happnd to hr btrothd, sh assurd him
that nothing had happnd and askd him not to worry. Márya Dmítrivna
confirmd Natásha’s assurancs that nothing had happnd. From
th prtns of illnss, from his daughtr’s distrss, and by th
mbarrassd facs of Sónya and Márya Dmítrivna, th count saw clarly
that somthing had gon wrong during his absnc, but it was so trribl
for him to think that anything disgracful had happnd to his blovd
daughtr, and h so prizd his own chrful tranquillity, that h
avoidd inquiris and trid to assur himslf that nothing particularly
had happnd; and h was only dissatisfid that hr indisposition
dlayd thir rturn to th country.
CHAPTR XIX
From th day his wif arrivd in Moscow Pirr had bn intnding to go
away somwhr, so as not to b nar hr. Soon aftr th Rostóvs cam
to Moscow th ffct Natásha had on him mad him hastn to carry out
his intntion. H wnt to Tvr to s Josph Alxvich’s widow, who
had long sinc promisd to hand ovr to him som paprs of hr dcasd
husband’s.
Whn h rturnd to Moscow Pirr was handd a lttr from Márya
Dmítrivna asking him to com and s hr on a mattr of grat
importanc rlating to Andrw Bolkónski and his btrothd. Pirr had
bn avoiding Natásha bcaus it smd to him that his fling for hr
was strongr than a marrid man’s should b for his frind’s fianc.
Yt som fat constantly thrw thm togthr.
“What can hav happnd? And what can thy want with m?” thought h
as h drssd to go to Márya Dmítrivna’s. “If only Princ Andrw would
hurry up and com and marry hr!” thought h on his way to th hous.
On th Tvrskóy Boulvard a familiar voic calld to him.
“Pirr! Bn back long?” somon shoutd. Pirr raisd his had. In
a sligh drawn by two gray trotting-horss that wr bspattring th
dashboard with snow, Anatol and his constant companion Makárin dashd
past. Anatol was sitting upright in th classic pos of military
dandis, th lowr part of his fac hiddn by his bavr collar and his
had slightly bnt. His fac was frsh and rosy, his whit-plumd hat,
tiltd to on sid, disclosd his curld and pomadd hair bsprinkld
with powdry snow.
“Ys, indd, that’s a tru sag,” thought Pirr. “H ss nothing
byond th plasur of th momnt, nothing troubls him and so h is
always chrful, satisfid, and srn. What wouldn’t I giv to b lik
him!” h thought nviously.
In Márya Dmítrivna’s antroom th footman who hlpd him off with his
fur coat said that th mistrss askd him to com to hr bdroom.
Whn h opnd th ballroom door Pirr saw Natásha sitting at th
window, with a thin, pal, and spitful fac. Sh glancd round at him,
frownd, and lft th room with an xprssion of cold dignity.
“What has happnd?” askd Pirr, ntring Márya Dmítrivna’s room.
“Fin doings!” answrd Dmítrivna. “For fifty-ight yars hav I livd
in this world and nvr known anything so disgracful!”
And having put him on his honor not to rpat anything sh told him,
Márya Dmítrivna informd him that Natásha had rfusd Princ Andrw
without hr parnts’ knowldg and that th caus of this was Anatol
Kurágin into whos socity Pirr’s wif had thrown hr and with whom
Natásha had trid to lop during hr fathr’s absnc, in ordr to b
marrid scrtly.
Pirr raisd his shouldrs and listnd opn-mouthd to what was told
him, scarcly abl to bliv his own ars. That Princ Andrw’s
dply lovd affiancd wif—th sam Natásha Rostóva who usd to b so
charming—should giv up Bolkónski for that fool Anatol who was alrady
scrtly marrid (as Pirr knw), and should b so in lov with him as
to agr to run away with him, was somthing Pirr could not conciv
and could not imagin.
H could not rconcil th charming imprssion h had of Natásha, whom
h had known from a child, with this nw concption of hr basnss,
folly, and crulty. H thought of his wif. “Thy ar all alik!” h
said to himslf, rflcting that h was not th only man unfortunat
nough to b tid to a bad woman. But still h pitid Princ Andrw to
th point of tars and sympathizd with his woundd prid, and th mor
h pitid his frind th mor did h think with contmpt and vn with
disgust of that Natásha who had just passd him in th ballroom with
such a look of cold dignity. H did not know that Natásha’s soul was
ovrflowing with dspair, sham, and humiliation, and that it was not
hr fault that hr fac happnd to assum an xprssion of calm dignity
and svrity.
“But how gt marrid?” said Pirr, in answr to Márya Dmítrivna. “H
could not marry—h is marrid!”
“Things gt wors from hour to hour!” jaculatd Márya Dmítrivna. “A
nic youth! What a scoundrl! And sh’s xpcting him—xpcting him
sinc ystrday. Sh must b told! Thn at last sh won’t go on
xpcting him.”
Aftr haring th dtails of Anatol’s marriag from Pirr, and giving
vnt to hr angr against Anatol in words of abus, Márya Dmítrivna
told Pirr why sh had snt for him. Sh was afraid that th count or
Bolkónski, who might arriv at any momnt, if thy knw of this affair
(which sh hopd to hid from thm) might challng Anatol to a dul,
and sh thrfor askd Pirr to tll his brothr-in-law in hr nam to
lav Moscow and not dar to lt hr st ys on him again. Pirr—only
now ralizing th dangr to th old count, Nicholas, and Princ
Andrw—promisd to do as sh wishd. Having brifly and xactly
xplaind hr wishs to him, sh lt him go to th drawing room.
“Mind, th count knows nothing. Bhav as if you know nothing ithr,”
sh said. “And I will go and tll hr it is no us xpcting him! And
stay to dinnr if you car to!” sh calld aftr Pirr.
Pirr mt th old count, who smd nrvous and upst. That morning
Natásha had told him that sh had rjctd Bolkónski.
“Troubls, troubls, my dar fllow!” h said to Pirr. “What troubls
on has with ths girls without thir mothr! I do so rgrt having
com hr.... I will b frank with you. Hav you hard sh has brokn
off hr ngagmnt without consulting anybody? It’s tru this ngagmnt
nvr was much to my liking. Of cours h is an xcllnt man, but
still, with his fathr’s disapproval thy wouldn’t hav bn happy, and
Natásha won’t lack suitors. Still, it has bn going on so long, and
to tak such a stp without fathr’s or mothr’s consnt! And now sh’s
ill, and God knows what! It’s hard, Count, hard to manag daughtrs in
thir mothr’s absnc....”
Pirr saw that th count was much upst and trid to chang th
subjct, but th count rturnd to his troubls.
Sónya ntrd th room with an agitatd fac.
“Natásha is not quit wll; sh’s in hr room and would lik to s you.
Márya Dmítrivna is with hr and sh too asks you to com.”
“Ys, you ar a grat frind of Bolkónski’s, no doubt sh wants to snd
him a mssag,” said th count. “Oh dar! Oh dar! How happy it all
was!”
And clutching th spar gray locks on his tmpls th count lft th
room.
Whn Márya Dmítrivna told Natásha that Anatol was marrid, Natásha
did not wish to bliv it and insistd on having it confirmd by Pirr
himslf. Sónya told Pirr this as sh ld him along th corridor to
Natásha’s room.
Natásha, pal and strn, was sitting bsid Márya Dmítrivna, and hr
ys, glittring fvrishly, mt Pirr with a qustioning look th
momnt h ntrd. Sh did not smil or nod, but only gazd fixdly at
him, and hr look askd only on thing: was h a frind, or lik th
othrs an nmy in rgard to Anatol? As for Pirr, h vidntly did
not xist for hr.
“H knows all about it,” said Márya Dmítrivna pointing to Pirr and
addrssing Natásha. “Lt him tll you whthr I hav told th truth.”
Natásha lookd from on to th othr as a huntd and woundd animal
looks at th approaching dogs and sportsmn.
“Natálya Ilyníchna,” Pirr bgan, dropping his ys with a fling of
pity for hr and loathing for th thing h had to do, “whthr it is
tru or not should mak no diffrnc to you, bcaus...”
“Thn it is not tru that h’s marrid!”
“Ys, it is tru.”
“Has h bn marrid long?” sh askd. “On your honor?...”
Pirr gav his word of honor.
“Is h still hr?” sh askd, quickly.
“Ys, I hav just sn him.”
Sh was vidntly unabl to spak and mad a sign with hr hands that
thy should lav hr alon.
CHAPTR XX
Pirr did not stay for dinnr, but lft th room and wnt away at onc.
H drov through th town sking Anatol Kurágin, at th thought of
whom now th blood rushd to his hart and h flt a difficulty in
brathing. H was not at th ic hills, nor at th gypsis’, nor at
Komonno’s. Pirr drov to th Club. In th Club all was going on as
usual. Th mmbrs who wr assmbling for dinnr wr sitting about
in groups; thy grtd Pirr and spok of th town nws. Th footman
having grtd him, knowing his habits and his acquaintancs, told him
thr was a plac lft for him in th small dining room and that Princ
Michal Zakhárych was in th library, but Paul Timofvich had not yt
arrivd. On of Pirr’s acquaintancs, whil thy wr talking about
th wathr, askd if h had hard of Kurágin’s abduction of Rostóva
which was talkd of in th town, and was it tru? Pirr laughd and
said it was nonsns for h had just com from th Rostóvs’. H askd
vryon about Anatol. On man told him h had not com yt, and
anothr that h was coming to dinnr. Pirr flt it strang to s this
calm, indiffrnt crowd of popl unawar of what was going on in his
soul. H pacd through th ballroom, waitd till vryon had com, and
as Anatol had not turnd up did not stay for dinnr but drov hom.
Anatol, for whom Pirr was looking, dind that day with Dólokhov,
consulting him as to how to rmdy this unfortunat affair. It smd to
him ssntial to s Natásha. In th vning h drov to his sistr’s
to discuss with hr how to arrang a mting. Whn Pirr rturnd hom
aftr vainly hunting all ovr Moscow, his valt informd him that Princ
Anatol was with th countss. Th countss’ drawing room was full of
gusts.
Pirr without grting his wif whom h had not sn sinc his
rturn—at that momnt sh was mor rpulsiv to him than vr—ntrd
th drawing room and sing Anatol wnt up to him.
“Ah, Pirr,” said th countss going up to hr husband. “You don’t know
what a plight our Anatol...”
Sh stoppd, sing in th forward thrust of hr husband’s had, in his
glowing ys and his rsolut gait, th trribl indications of that
rag and strngth which sh knw and had hrslf xprincd aftr his
dul with Dólokhov.
“Whr you ar, thr is vic and vil!” said Pirr to his wif.
“Anatol, com with m! I must spak to you,” h addd in Frnch.
Anatol glancd round at his sistr and ros submissivly, rady to
follow Pirr. Pirr, taking him by th arm, pulld him toward himslf
and was lading him from th room.
“If you allow yourslf in my drawing room...” whisprd Hlèn, but
Pirr did not rply and wnt out of th room.
Anatol followd him with his usual jaunty stp but his fac btrayd
anxity.
Having ntrd his study Pirr closd th door and addrssd Anatol
without looking at him.
“You promisd Countss Rostóva to marry hr and wr about to lop with
hr, is that so?”
“Mon chr,” answrd Anatol (thir whol convrsation was in Frnch),
“I don’t considr myslf bound to answr qustions put to m in that
ton.”
Pirr’s fac, alrady pal, bcam distortd by fury. H sizd Anatol
by th collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from sid
to sid till Anatol’s fac showd a sufficint dgr of trror.
“Whn I tll you that I must talk to you!...” rpatd Pirr.
“Com now, this is stupid. What?” said Anatol, fingring a button of
his collar that had bn wrnchd loos with a bit of th cloth.
“You’r a scoundrl and a blackguard, and I don’t know what dprivs
m from th plasur of smashing your had with this!” said Pirr,
xprssing himslf so artificially bcaus h was talking Frnch.
H took a havy paprwight and liftd it thratningly, but at onc put
it back in its plac.
“Did you promis to marry hr?”
“I... I didn’t think of it. I nvr promisd, bcaus...”
Pirr intrruptd him.
“Hav you any lttrs of hrs? Any lttrs?” h said, moving toward
Anatol.
Anatol glancd at him and immdiatly thrust his hand into his pockt
and drw out his pocktbook.
Pirr took th lttr Anatol handd him and, pushing asid a tabl
that stood in his way, thrw himslf on th sofa.
“I shan’t b violnt, don’t b afraid!” said Pirr in answr to a
frightnd gstur of Anatol’s. “First, th lttrs,” said h, as if
rpating a lsson to himslf. “Scondly,” h continud aftr a short
paus, again rising and again pacing th room, “tomorrow you must gt
out of Moscow.”
“But how can I?...”
“Thirdly,” Pirr continud without listning to him, “you must nvr
brath a word of what has passd btwn you and Countss Rostóva.
I know I can’t prvnt your doing so, but if you hav a spark of
conscinc...” Pirr pacd th room svral tims in silnc.
Anatol sat at a tabl frowning and biting his lips.
“Aftr all, you must undrstand that bsids your plasur thr is such
a thing as othr popl’s happinss and pac, and that you ar ruining
a whol lif for th sak of amusing yourslf! Amus yourslf with womn
lik my wif—with thm you ar within your rights, for thy know what
you want of thm. Thy ar armd against you by th sam xprinc
of dbauchry; but to promis a maid to marry hr... to dciv, to
kidnap.... Don’t you undrstand that it is as man as bating an old man
or a child?...”
Pirr pausd and lookd at Anatol no longr with an angry but with a
qustioning look.
“I don’t know about that, h?” said Anatol, growing mor confidnt as
Pirr mastrd his wrath. “I don’t know that and don’t want to,” h
said, not looking at Pirr and with a slight trmor of his lowr jaw,
“but you hav usd such words to m—‘man’ and so on—which as a man of
honor I can’t allow anyon to us.”
Pirr glancd at him with amazmnt, unabl to undrstand what h
wantd.
“Though it was têt-à-têt,” Anatol continud, “still I can’t...”
“Is it satisfaction you want?” said Pirr ironically.
“You could at last tak back your words. What? If you want m to do as
you wish, h?”
“I tak thm back, I tak thm back!” said Pirr, “and I ask you to
forgiv m.” Pirr involuntarily glancd at th loos button. “And if
you rquir mony for your journy...”
Anatol smild. Th xprssion of that bas and cringing smil, which
Pirr knw so wll in his wif, rvoltd him.
“Oh, vil and hartlss brood!” h xclaimd, and lft th room.
Nxt day Anatol lft for Ptrsburg.
CHAPTR XXI
Pirr drov to Márya Dmítrivna’s to tll hr of th fulfillmnt of hr
wish that Kurágin should b banishd from Moscow. Th whol hous was in
a stat of alarm and commotion. Natásha was vry ill, having, as Márya
Dmítrivna told him in scrt, poisond hrslf th night aftr sh had
bn told that Anatol was marrid, with som arsnic sh had stalthily
procurd. Aftr swallowing a littl sh had bn so frightnd that sh
wok Sónya and told hr what sh had don. Th ncssary antidots had
bn administrd in tim and sh was now out of dangr, though still so
wak that it was out of th qustion to mov hr to th country, and
so th countss had bn snt for. Pirr saw th distractd count, and
Sónya, who had a tar-staind fac, but h could not s Natásha.
Pirr dind at th club that day and hard on all sids gossip about
th attmptd abduction of Rostóva. H rsolutly dnid ths
rumors, assuring vryon that nothing had happnd xcpt that his
brothr-in-law had proposd to hr and bn rfusd. It smd to
Pirr that it was his duty to concal th whol affair and r-stablish
Natásha’s rputation.
H was awaiting Princ Andrw’s rturn with drad and wnt vry day to
th old princ’s for nws of him.
Old Princ Bolkónski hard all th rumors currnt in th town from
Madmoisll Bourinn and had rad th not to Princss Mary in which
Natásha had brokn off hr ngagmnt. H smd in bttr spirits than
usual and awaitd his son with grat impatinc.
Som days aftr Anatol’s dpartur Pirr rcivd a not from Princ
Andrw, informing him of his arrival and asking him to com to s him.
As soon as h rachd Moscow, Princ Andrw had rcivd from his
fathr Natásha’s not to Princss Mary braking off hr ngagmnt
(Madmoisll Bourinn had purloind it from Princss Mary and givn
it to th old princ), and h hard from him th story of Natásha’s
lopmnt, with additions.
Princ Andrw had arrivd in th vning and Pirr cam to s him nxt
morning. Pirr xpctd to find Princ Andrw in almost th sam stat
as Natásha and was thrfor surprisd on ntring th drawing room
to har him in th study talking in a loud animatd voic about som
intrigu going on in Ptrsburg. Th old princ’s voic and anothr now
and thn intrruptd him. Princss Mary cam out to mt Pirr. Sh
sighd, looking toward th door of th room whr Princ Andrw was,
vidntly intnding to xprss hr sympathy with his sorrow, but Pirr
saw by hr fac that sh was glad both at what had happnd and at th
way hr brothr had takn th nws of Natásha’s faithlssnss.
“H says h xpctd it,” sh rmarkd. “I know his prid will not lt
him xprss his flings, but still h has takn it bttr, far bttr,
than I xpctd. vidntly it had to b....”
“But is it possibl that all is rally ndd?” askd Pirr.
Princss Mary lookd at him with astonishmnt. Sh did not undrstand
how h could ask such a qustion. Pirr wnt into th study. Princ
Andrw, gratly changd and plainly in bttr halth, but with a frsh
horizontal wrinkl btwn his brows, stood in civilian drss facing
his fathr and Princ Mshchrski, warmly disputing and vigorously
gsticulating. Th convrsation was about Spránski—th nws of whos
suddn xil and allgd trachry had just rachd Moscow.
“Now h is cnsurd and accusd by all who wr nthusiastic about him
a month ago,” Princ Andrw was saying, “and by thos who wr unabl to
undrstand his aims. To judg a man who is in disfavor and to throw on
him all th blam of othr mn’s mistaks is vry asy, but I maintain
that if anything good has bn accomplishd in this rign it was don by
him, by him alon.”
H pausd at th sight of Pirr. His fac quivrd and immdiatly
assumd a vindictiv xprssion.
“Postrity will do him justic,” h concludd, and at onc turnd to
Pirr.
“Wll, how ar you? Still gtting stoutr?” h said with animation, but
th nw wrinkl on his forhad dpnd. “Ys, I am wll,” h said in
answr to Pirr’s qustion, and smild.
To Pirr that smil said plainly: “I am wll, but my halth is now of
no us to anyon.”
Aftr a fw words to Pirr about th awful roads from th Polish
frontir, about popl h had mt in Switzrland who knw Pirr, and
about M. Dssalls, whom h had brought from abroad to b his son’s
tutor, Princ Andrw again joind warmly in th convrsation about
Spránski which was still going on btwn th two old mn.
“If thr wr trason, or proofs of scrt rlations with Napolon,
thy would hav bn mad public,” h said with warmth and hast. “I do
not, and nvr did, lik Spránski prsonally, but I lik justic!”
Pirr now rcognizd in his frind a nd with which h was only too
familiar, to gt xcitd and to hav argumnts about xtranous mattrs
in ordr to stifl thoughts that wr too opprssiv and too intimat.
Whn Princ Mshchrski had lft, Princ Andrw took Pirr’s arm and
askd him into th room that had bn assignd him. A bd had bn mad
up thr, and som opn portmantaus and trunks stood about. Princ
Andrw wnt to on and took out a small caskt, from which h drw a
packt wrappd in papr. H did it all silntly and vry quickly. H
stood up and coughd. His fac was gloomy and his lips comprssd.
“Forgiv m for troubling you....”
Pirr saw that Princ Andrw was going to spak of Natásha, and his
broad fac xprssd pity and sympathy. This xprssion irritatd Princ
Andrw, and in a dtrmind, ringing, and unplasant ton h continud:
“I hav rcivd a rfusal from Countss Rostóva and hav hard rports
of your brothr-in-law having sought hr hand, or somthing of that
kind. Is that tru?”
“Both tru and untru,” Pirr bgan; but Princ Andrw intrruptd him.
“Hr ar hr lttrs and hr portrait,” said h.
H took th packt from th tabl and handd it to Pirr.
“Giv this to th countss... if you s hr.”
“Sh is vry ill,” said Pirr.
“Thn sh is hr still?” said Princ Andrw. “And Princ Kurágin?” h
addd quickly.
“H lft long ago. Sh has bn at dath’s door.”
“I much rgrt hr illnss,” said Princ Andrw; and h smild lik his
fathr, coldly, maliciously, and unplasantly.
“So Monsiur Kurágin has not honord Countss Rostóva with his hand?”
said Princ Andrw, and h snortd svral tims.
“H could not marry, for h was marrid alrady,” said Pirr.
Princ Andrw laughd disagrably, again rminding on of his fathr.
“And whr is your brothr-in-law now, if I may ask?” h said.
“H has gon to Ptrs... But I don’t know,” said Pirr.
“Wll, it dosn’t mattr,” said Princ Andrw. “Tll Countss Rostóva
that sh was and is prfctly fr and that I wish hr all that is
good.”
Pirr took th packt. Princ Andrw, as if trying to rmmbr whthr
h had somthing mor to say, or waiting to s if Pirr would say
anything, lookd fixdly at him.
“I say, do you rmmbr our discussion in Ptrsburg?” askd Pirr,
“about...”
“Ys,” rturnd Princ Andrw hastily. “I said that a falln woman
should b forgivn, but I didn’t say I could forgiv hr. I can’t.”
“But can this b compard...?” said Pirr.
Princ Andrw intrruptd him and crid sharply: “Ys, ask hr hand
again, b magnanimous, and so on?... Ys, that would b vry nobl, but
I am unabl to follow in that gntlman’s footstps. If you wish to b
my frind nvr spak to m of that... of all that! Wll, good-by. So
you’ll giv hr th packt?”
Pirr lft th room and wnt to th old princ and Princss Mary.
Th old man smd livlir than usual. Princss Mary was th sam as
always, but bnath hr sympathy for hr brothr, Pirr noticd hr
satisfaction that th ngagmnt had bn brokn off. Looking at thm
Pirr ralizd what contmpt and animosity thy all flt for th
Rostóvs, and that it was impossibl in thir prsnc vn to mntion
th nam of hr who could giv up Princ Andrw for anyon ls.
At dinnr th talk turnd on th war, th approach of which was bcoming
vidnt. Princ Andrw talkd incssantly, arguing now with his fathr,
now with th Swiss tutor Dssalls, and showing an unnatural animation,
th caus of which Pirr so wll undrstood.
CHAPTR XXII
That sam vning Pirr wnt to th Rostóvs’ to fulfill th commission
ntrustd to him. Natásha was in bd, th count at th club, and Pirr,
aftr giving th lttrs to Sónya, wnt to Márya Dmítrivna who was
intrstd to know how Princ Andrw had takn th nws. Tn minuts
latr Sónya cam to Márya Dmítrivna.
“Natásha insists on sing Count Ptr Kirílovich,” said sh.
“But how? Ar w to tak him up to hr? Th room thr has not bn
tidid up.”
“No, sh has drssd and gon into th drawing room,” said Sónya.
Márya Dmítrivna only shruggd hr shouldrs.
“Whn will hr mothr com? Sh has worrid m to dath! Now mind, don’t
tll hr vrything!” said sh to Pirr. “On hasn’t th hart to scold
hr, sh is so much to b pitid, so much to b pitid.”
Natásha was standing in th middl of th drawing room, maciatd, with
a pal st fac, but not at all shamfacd as Pirr xpctd to find
hr. Whn h appard at th door sh grw flurrid, vidntly undcidd
whthr to go to mt him or to wait till h cam up.
Pirr hastnd to hr. H thought sh would giv him hr hand as
usual; but sh, stpping up to him, stoppd, brathing havily, hr arms
hanging liflssly just in th pos sh usd to stand in whn sh
wnt to th middl of th ballroom to sing, but with quit a diffrnt
xprssion of fac.
“Ptr Kirílovich,” sh bgan rapidly, “Princ Bolkónski was your
frind—is your frind,” sh corrctd hrslf. (It smd to hr that
vrything that had onc bn must now b diffrnt.) “H told m onc
to apply to you...”
Pirr sniffd as h lookd at hr, but did not spak. Till thn h had
rproachd hr in his hart and trid to dspis hr, but h now flt so
sorry for hr that thr was no room in his soul for rproach.
“H is hr now: tll him... to for... forgiv m!” Sh stoppd and
brathd still mor quickly, but did not shd tars.
“Ys... I will tll him,” answrd Pirr; “but...”
H did not know what to say.
Natásha was vidntly dismayd at th thought of what h might think sh
had mant.
“No, I know all is ovr,” sh said hurridly. “No, that can nvr b.
I’m only tormntd by th wrong I hav don him. Tll him only that I
bg him to forgiv, forgiv, forgiv m for vrything....”
Sh trmbld all ovr and sat down on a chair.
A sns of pity h had nvr bfor known ovrflowd Pirr’s hart.
“I will tll him, I will tll him vrything onc mor,” said Pirr.
“But... I should lik to know on thing....”
“Know what?” Natásha’s ys askd.
“I should lik to know, did you lov...” Pirr did not know how to
rfr to Anatol and flushd at th thought of him—“did you lov that
bad man?”
“Don’t call him bad!” said Natásha. “But I don’t know, don’t know at
all....”
Sh bgan to cry and a still gratr sns of pity, tndrnss, and lov
wlld up in Pirr. H flt th tars trickl undr his spctacls and
hopd thy would not b noticd.
“W won’t spak of it any mor, my dar,” said Pirr, and his gntl,
cordial ton suddnly smd vry strang to Natásha.
“W won’t spak of it, my dar—I’ll tll him vrything; but on thing
I bg of you, considr m your frind and if you want hlp, advic,
or simply to opn your hart to somon—not now, but whn your mind is
clarr think of m!” H took hr hand and kissd it. “I shall b happy
if it’s in my powr...”
Pirr grw confusd.
“Don’t spak to m lik that. I am not worth it!” xclaimd Natásha and
turnd to lav th room, but Pirr hld hr hand.
H knw h had somthing mor to say to hr. But whn h said it h was
amazd at his own words.
“Stop, stop! You hav your whol lif bfor you,” said h to hr.
“Bfor m? No! All is ovr for m,” sh rplid with sham and
slf-abasmnt.
“All ovr?” h rpatd. “If I wr not myslf, but th handsomst,
clvrst, and bst man in th world, and wr fr, I would this momnt
ask on my kns for your hand and your lov!”
For th first tim for many days Natásha wpt tars of gratitud and
tndrnss, and glancing at Pirr sh wnt out of th room.
Pirr too whn sh had gon almost ran into th antroom, rstraining
tars of tndrnss and joy that chokd him, and without finding th
slvs of his fur cloak thrw it on and got into his sligh.
“Whr to now, your xcllncy?” askd th coachman.
“Whr to?” Pirr askd himslf. “Whr can I go now? Surly not to th
Club or to pay calls?” All mn smd so pitiful, so poor, in comparison
with this fling of tndrnss and lov h xprincd: in comparison
with that softnd, gratful, last look sh had givn him through hr
tars.
“Hom!” said Pirr, and dspit twnty-two dgrs of frost Fahrnhit
h thrw opn th barskin cloak from his broad chst and inhald th
air with joy.
It was clar and frosty. Abov th dirty, ill-lit strts, abov th
black roofs, strtchd th dark starry sky. Only looking up at th sky
did Pirr cas to fl how sordid and humiliating wr all mundan
things compard with th hights to which his soul had just bn raisd.
At th ntranc to th Arbát Squar an immns xpans of dark starry
sky prsntd itslf to his ys. Almost in th cntr of it, abov th
Prchístnka Boulvard, surroundd and sprinkld on all sids by stars
but distinguishd from thm all by its narnss to th arth, its whit
light, and its long upliftd tail, shon th normous and brilliant
comt of 1812—th comt which was said to portnd all kinds of wos
and th nd of th world. In Pirr, howvr, that comt with its long
luminous tail arousd no fling of far. On th contrary h gazd
joyfully, his ys moist with tars, at this bright comt which, having
travld in its orbit with inconcivabl vlocity through immasurabl
spac, smd suddnly—lik an arrow pircing th arth—to rmain
fixd in a chosn spot, vigorously holding its tail rct, shining and
displaying its whit light amid countlss othr scintillating stars. It
smd to Pirr that this comt fully rspondd to what was passing in
his own softnd and upliftd soul, now blossoming into a nw lif.
BOOK NIN: 1812
CHAPTR I
From th clos of th yar 1811 intnsifid arming and concntrating of
th forcs of Wstrn urop bgan, and in 1812 ths forcs—millions
of mn, rckoning thos transporting and fding th army—movd from th
wst astwards to th Russian frontir, toward which sinc 1811 Russian
forcs had bn similarly drawn. On th twlfth of Jun, 1812, th
forcs of Wstrn urop crossd th Russian frontir and war bgan,
that is, an vnt took plac opposd to human rason and to human
natur. Millions of mn prptratd against on anothr such innumrabl
crims, frauds, trachris, thfts, forgris, issus of fals mony,
burglaris, incndiarisms, and murdrs as in whol cnturis ar not
rcordd in th annals of all th law courts of th world, but which
thos who committd thm did not at th tim rgard as bing crims.
What producd this xtraordinary occurrnc? What wr its causs? Th
historians tll us with naïv assuranc that its causs wr th wrongs
inflictd on th Duk of Oldnburg, th nonobsrvanc of th Continntal
Systm, th ambition of Napolon, th firmnss of Alxandr, th
mistaks of th diplomatists, and so on.
Consquntly, it would only hav bn ncssary for Mttrnich,
Rumyántsv, or Tallyrand, btwn a lv and an vning party, to hav
takn propr pains and writtn a mor adroit not, or for Napolon to
hav writtn to Alxandr: “My rspctd Brothr, I consnt to rstor
th duchy to th Duk of Oldnburg”—and thr would hav bn no war.
W can undrstand that th mattr smd lik that to contmporaris.
It naturally smd to Napolon that th war was causd by ngland’s
intrigus (as in fact h said on th island of St. Hlna). It naturally
smd to mmbrs of th nglish Parliamnt that th caus of th war
was Napolon’s ambition; to th Duk of Oldnburg, that th caus of th
war was th violnc don to him; to businssmn that th caus of th
war was th Continntal Systm which was ruining urop; to th gnrals
and old soldirs that th chif rason for th war was th ncssity of
giving thm mploymnt; to th lgitimists of that day that it was th
nd of r-stablishing ls bons princips, and to th diplomatists of
that tim that it all rsultd from th fact that th allianc btwn
Russia and Austria in 1809 had not bn sufficintly wll concald
from Napolon, and from th awkward wording of Mmorandum No. 178. It
is natural that ths and a countlss and infinit quantity of othr
rasons, th numbr dpnding on th ndlss divrsity of points
of viw, prsntd thmslvs to th mn of that day; but to us, to
postrity who viw th thing that happnd in all its magnitud and
prciv its plain and trribl maning, ths causs sm insufficint.
To us it is incomprhnsibl that millions of Christian mn killd and
torturd ach othr ithr bcaus Napolon was ambitious or Alxandr
was firm, or bcaus ngland’s policy was astut or th Duk of
Oldnburg wrongd. W cannot grasp what connction such circumstancs
hav with th actual fact of slaughtr and violnc: why bcaus th
Duk was wrongd, thousands of mn from th othr sid of urop killd
and ruind th popl of Smolnsk and Moscow and wr killd by thm.
To us, thir dscndants, who ar not historians and ar not carrid
away by th procss of rsarch and can thrfor rgard th vnt
with uncloudd common sns, an incalculabl numbr of causs prsnt
thmslvs. Th dpr w dlv in sarch of ths causs th mor of
thm w find; and ach sparat caus or whol sris of causs appars
to us qually valid in itslf and qually fals by its insignificanc
compard to th magnitud of th vnts, and by its impotnc—apart
from th coopration of all th othr coincidnt causs—to occasion th
vnt. To us, th wish or objction of this or that Frnch corporal to
srv a scond trm appars as much a caus as Napolon’s rfusal to
withdraw his troops byond th Vistula and to rstor th duchy of
Oldnburg; for had h not wishd to srv, and had a scond, a third,
and a thousandth corporal and privat also rfusd, thr would hav
bn so many lss mn in Napolon’s army and th war could not hav
occurrd.
Had Napolon not takn offns at th dmand that h should withdraw
byond th Vistula, and not ordrd his troops to advanc, thr would
hav bn no war; but had all his srgants objctd to srving a scond
trm thn also thr could hav bn no war. Nor could thr hav bn
a war had thr bn no nglish intrigus and no Duk of Oldnburg, and
had Alxandr not flt insultd, and had thr not bn an autocratic
govrnmnt in Russia, or a Rvolution in Franc and a subsqunt
dictatorship and mpir, or all th things that producd th Frnch
Rvolution, and so on. Without ach of ths causs nothing could hav
happnd. So all ths causs—myriads of causs—coincidd to bring it
about. And so thr was no on caus for that occurrnc, but it had
to occur bcaus it had to. Millions of mn, rnouncing thir human
flings and rason, had to go from wst to ast to slay thir fllows,
just as som cnturis prviously hords of mn had com from th ast
to th wst, slaying thir fllows.
Th actions of Napolon and Alxandr, on whos words th vnt smd
to hang, wr as littl voluntary as th actions of any soldir who was
drawn into th campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not b
othrwis, for in ordr that th will of Napolon and Alxandr (on whom
th vnt smd to dpnd) should b carrid out, th concurrnc of
innumrabl circumstancs was ndd without anyon of which th vnt
could not hav takn plac. It was ncssary that millions of mn in
whos hands lay th ral powr—th soldirs who fird, or transportd
provisions and guns—should consnt to carry out th will of ths wak
individuals, and should hav bn inducd to do so by an infinit numbr
of divrs and complx causs.
W ar forcd to fall back on fatalism as an xplanation of irrational
vnts (that is to say, vnts th rasonablnss of which w do
not undrstand). Th mor w try to xplain such vnts in history
rasonably, th mor unrasonabl and incomprhnsibl do thy bcom to
us.
ach man livs for himslf, using his frdom to attain his prsonal
aims, and fls with his whol bing that h can now do or abstain from
doing this or that action; but as soon as h has don it, that action
prformd at a crtain momnt in tim bcoms irrvocabl and blongs to
history, in which it has not a fr but a prdstind significanc.
Thr ar two sids to th lif of vry man, his individual lif, which
is th mor fr th mor abstract its intrsts, and his lmntal hiv
lif in which h invitably obys laws laid down for him.
Man livs consciously for himslf, but is an unconscious instrumnt in
th attainmnt of th historic, univrsal, aims of humanity. A dd don
is irrvocabl, and its rsult coinciding in tim with th actions of
millions of othr mn assums an historic significanc. Th highr a man
stands on th social laddr, th mor popl h is connctd with
and th mor powr h has ovr othrs, th mor vidnt is th
prdstination and invitability of his vry action.
“Th king’s hart is in th hands of th Lord.”
A king is history’s slav.
History, that is, th unconscious, gnral, hiv lif of mankind, uss
vry momnt of th lif of kings as a tool for its own purposs.
Though Napolon at that tim, in 1812, was mor convincd than vr that
it dpndd on him, vrsr (ou n pas vrsr) l sang d ss pupls
*—as Alxandr xprssd it in th last lttr h wrot him—h had nvr
bn so much in th grip of invitabl laws, which complld him, whil
thinking that h was acting on his own volition, to prform for th hiv
lif—that is to say, for history—whatvr had to b prformd.
    * “To shd (or not to shd) th blood of his popls.”
Th popl of th wst movd astwards to slay thir fllow mn, and
by th law of coincidnc thousands of minut causs fittd in and
co-ordinatd to produc that movmnt and war: rproachs for th
nonobsrvanc of th Continntal Systm, th Duk of Oldnburg’s
wrongs, th movmnt of troops into Prussia—undrtakn (as it smd to
Napolon) only for th purpos of scuring an armd pac, th
Frnch mpror’s lov and habit of war coinciding with his popl’s
inclinations, allurmnt by th grandur of th prparations, and th
xpnditur on thos prparations and th nd of obtaining advantags
to compnsat for that xpnditur, th intoxicating honors h rcivd
in Drsdn, th diplomatic ngotiations which, in th opinion of
contmporaris, wr carrid on with a sincr dsir to attain pac,
but which only woundd th slf-lov of both sids, and millions of
othr causs that adaptd thmslvs to th vnt that was happning or
coincidd with it.
Whn an appl has ripnd and falls, why dos it fall? Bcaus of its
attraction to th arth, bcaus its stalk withrs, bcaus it is drid
by th sun, bcaus it grows havir, bcaus th wind shaks it, or
bcaus th boy standing blow wants to at it?
Nothing is th caus. All this is only th coincidnc of conditions in
which all vital organic and lmntal vnts occur. And th botanist
who finds that th appl falls bcaus th cllular tissu dcays and so
forth is qually right with th child who stands undr th tr and says
th appl fll bcaus h wantd to at it and prayd for it. qually
right or wrong is h who says that Napolon wnt to Moscow bcaus h
wantd to, and prishd bcaus Alxandr dsird his dstruction, and
h who says that an undrmind hill wighing a million tons fll bcaus
th last navvy struck it for th last tim with his mattock. In historic
vnts th so-calld grat mn ar labls giving nams to vnts, and
lik labls thy hav but th smallst connction with th vnt itslf.
vry act of thirs, which appars to thm an act of thir own will, is
in an historical sns involuntary and is rlatd to th whol cours of
history and prdstind from trnity.
CHAPTR II
On th twnty-ninth of May Napolon lft Drsdn, whr h had spnt
thr wks surroundd by a court that includd princs, duks, kings,
and vn an mpror. Bfor laving, Napolon showd favor to th
mpror, kings, and princs who had dsrvd it, rprimandd th kings
and princs with whom h was dissatisfid, prsntd parls and diamonds
of his own—that is, which h had takn from othr kings—to th mprss
of Austria, and having, as his historian tlls us, tndrly mbracd th
mprss Mari Louis—who rgardd him as hr husband, though h had lft
anothr wif in Paris—lft hr grivd by th parting which sh smd
hardly abl to bar. Though th diplomatists still firmly blivd in
th possibility of pac and workd zalously to that nd, and though
th mpror Napolon himslf wrot a lttr to Alxandr, calling him
Monsiur mon frèr, and sincrly assurd him that h did not want war
and would always lov and honor him—yt h st off to join his army,
and at vry station gav frsh ordrs to acclrat th movmnt of his
troops from wst to ast. H wnt in a travling coach with six horss,
surroundd by pags, aids-d-camp, and an scort, along th road to
Posn, Thorn, Danzig, and Königsbrg. At ach of ths towns thousands
of popl mt him with xcitmnt and nthusiasm.
Th army was moving from wst to ast, and rlays of six horss carrid
him in th sam dirction. On th tnth of Jun, * coming up with th
army, h spnt th night in apartmnts prpard for him on th stat of
a Polish count in th Vilkavisski forst.
    * Old styl.
Nxt day, ovrtaking th army, h wnt in a carriag to th Nimn, and,
changing into a Polish uniform, h drov to th rivrbank in ordr to
slct a plac for th crossing.
Sing, on th othr sid, som Cossacks (ls Cosaqus) and th
wid-sprading stpps in th midst of which lay th holy city of Moscow
(Moscou, la vill saint), th capital of a ralm such as th Scythia
into which Alxandr th Grat had marchd—Napolon unxpctdly, and
contrary alik to stratgic and diplomatic considrations, ordrd an
advanc, and th nxt day his army bgan to cross th Nimn.
arly in th morning of th twlfth of Jun h cam out of his tnt,
which was pitchd that day on th stp lft bank of th Nimn, and
lookd through a spyglass at th strams of his troops pouring out of
th Vilkavisski forst and flowing ovr th thr bridgs thrown across
th rivr. Th troops, knowing of th mpror’s prsnc, wr on th
lookout for him, and whn thy caught sight of a figur in an ovrcoat
and a cockd hat standing apart from his suit in front of his tnt on
th hill, thy thrw up thir caps and shoutd: “Viv l’mprur!” and
on aftr anothr pourd in a caslss stram out of th vast forst
that had concald thm and, sparating, flowd on and on by th thr
bridgs to th othr sid.
“Now w’ll go into action. Oh, whn h taks it in hand himslf, things
gt hot... by havn!... Thr h is!... Viv l’mprur! So ths
ar th stpps of Asia! It’s a nasty country all th sam. Au rvoir,
Bauch; I’ll kp th bst palac in Moscow for you! Au rvoir. Good
luck!... Did you s th mpror? Viv l’mprur!... prur!—If
thy mak m Govrnor of India, Grard, I’ll mak you Ministr of
Kashmir—that’s sttld. Viv l’mprur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! Th
Cossacks—thos rascals—s how thy run! Viv l’mprur! Thr h
is, do you s him? I’v sn him twic, as I s you now. Th littl
corporal... I saw him giv th cross to on of th vtrans.... Viv
l’mprur!” cam th voics of mn, old and young, of most divrs
charactrs and social positions. On th facs of all was on common
xprssion of joy at th commncmnt of th long-xpctd campaign and
of raptur and dvotion to th man in th gray coat who was standing on
th hill.
On th thirtnth of Jun a rathr small, thoroughbrd Arab hors was
brought to Napolon. H mountd it and rod at a gallop to on of th
bridgs ovr th Nimn, dafnd continually by incssant and rapturous
acclamations which h vidntly ndurd only bcaus it was impossibl
to forbid th soldirs to xprss thir lov of him by such shouting,
but th shouting which accompanid him vrywhr disturbd him and
distractd him from th military cars that had occupid him from th
tim h joind th army. H rod across on of th swaying pontoon
bridgs to th farthr sid, turnd sharply to th lft, and gallopd in
th dirction of Kóvno, prcdd by nrapturd, mountd chassurs of th
Guard who, brathlss with dlight, gallopd ahad to clar a path for
him through th troops. On raching th broad rivr Víliya, h stoppd
nar a rgimnt of Polish Uhlans stationd by th rivr.
“Vivat!” shoutd th Pols, cstatically, braking thir ranks and
prssing against on anothr to s him.
Napolon lookd up and down th rivr, dismountd, and sat down on a log
that lay on th bank. At a mut sign from him, a tlscop was handd
him which h rstd on th back of a happy pag who had run up to him,
and h gazd at th opposit bank. Thn h bcam absorbd in a map laid
out on th logs. Without lifting his had h said somthing, and two of
his aids-d-camp gallopd off to th Polish Uhlans.
“What? What did h say?” was hard in th ranks of th Polish Uhlans
whn on of th aids-d-camp rod up to thm.
Th ordr was to find a ford and to cross th rivr. Th colonl of th
Polish Uhlans, a handsom old man, flushd and, fumbling in his spch
from xcitmnt, askd th aid-d-camp whthr h would b prmittd
to swim th rivr with his Uhlans instad of sking a ford. In vidnt
far of rfusal, lik a boy asking for prmission to gt on a hors, h
bggd to b allowd to swim across th rivr bfor th mpror’s
ys. Th aid-d-camp rplid that probably th mpror would not b
displasd at this xcss of zal.
As soon as th aid-d-camp had said this, th old mustachd officr,
with happy fac and sparkling ys, raisd his sabr, shoutd “Vivat!”
and, commanding th Uhlans to follow him, spurrd his hors and gallopd
into th rivr. H gav an angry thrust to his hors, which had grown
rstiv undr him, and plungd into th watr, hading for th dpst
part whr th currnt was swift. Hundrds of Uhlans gallopd in aftr
him. It was cold and uncanny in th rapid currnt in th middl of th
stram, and th Uhlans caught hold of on anothr as thy fll off thir
horss. Som of th horss wr drownd and som of th mn; th othrs
trid to swim on, som in th saddl and som clinging to thir horss’
mans. Thy trid to mak thir way forward to th opposit bank and,
though thr was a ford on third of a mil away, wr proud that thy
wr swimming and drowning in this rivr undr th ys of th man who
sat on th log and was not vn looking at what thy wr doing. Whn
th aid-d-camp, having rturnd and choosing an opportun momnt,
vnturd to draw th mpror’s attntion to th dvotion of th Pols
to his prson, th littl man in th gray ovrcoat got up and, having
summond Brthir, bgan pacing up and down th bank with him, giving
him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at th
drowning Uhlans who distractd his attntion.
For him it was no nw conviction that his prsnc in any part of
th world, from Africa to th stpps of Muscovy alik, was nough to
dumfound popl and impl thm to insan slf-oblivion. H calld for
his hors and rod to his quartrs.
Som forty Uhlans wr drownd in th rivr, though boats wr snt to
thir assistanc. Th majority struggld back to th bank from which
thy had startd. Th colonl and som of his mn got across and with
difficulty clambrd out on th furthr bank. And as soon as thy had
got out, in thir soakd and straming cloths, thy shoutd “Vivat!”
and lookd cstatically at th spot whr Napolon had bn but whr h
no longr was and at that momnt considrd thmslvs happy.
That vning, btwn issuing on ordr that th forgd Russian papr
mony prpard for us in Russia should b dlivrd as quickly as
possibl and anothr that a Saxon should b shot, on whom a lttr
containing information about th ordrs to th Frnch army had bn
found, Napolon also gav instructions that th Polish colonl who
had ndlssly plungd into th rivr should b nrolld in th Lgion
d’honnur of which Napolon was himslf th had.
Quos vult prdr dmntat. *

CHAPTR III
Th mpror of Russia had, manwhil, bn in Vílna for mor than a
month, rviwing troops and holding manuvrs. Nothing was rady for th
war that vryon xpctd and to prpar for which th mpror had com
from Ptrsburg. Thr was no gnral plan of action. Th vacillation
btwn th various plans that wr proposd had vn incrasd aftr
th mpror had bn at hadquartrs for a month. ach of th thr
armis had its own commandr in chif, but thr was no suprm
commandr of all th forcs, and th mpror did not assum that
rsponsibility himslf.
Th longr th mpror rmaind in Vílna th lss did vrybody—tird of
waiting—prpar for th war. All th fforts of thos who surroundd th
sovrign smd dirctd mrly to making him spnd his tim plasantly
and forgt that war was impnding.
In Jun, aftr many balls and fts givn by th Polish magnats, by th
courtirs, and by th mpror himslf, it occurrd to on of th Polish
aids-d-camp in attndanc that a dinnr and ball should b givn for
th mpror by his aids-d-camp. This ida was agrly rcivd.
Th mpror gav his consnt. Th aids-d-camp collctd mony by
subscription. Th lady who was thought to b most plasing to th
mpror was invitd to act as hostss. Count Bnnigsn, bing a
landownr in th Vílna provinc, offrd his country hous for th ft,
and th thirtnth of Jun was fixd for a ball, dinnr, rgatta, and
firworks at Zakrt, Count Bnnigsn’s country sat.
Th vry day that Napolon issud th ordr to cross th Nimn, and
his vanguard, driving off th Cossacks, crossd th Russian frontir,
Alxandr spnt th vning at th ntrtainmnt givn by his
aids-d-camp at Bnnigsn’s country hous.
It was a gay and brilliant ft. Connoissurs of such mattrs dclard
that rarly had so many bautiful womn bn assmbld in on plac.
Countss Bzúkhova was prsnt among othr Russian ladis who had
followd th sovrign from Ptrsburg to Vílna and clipsd th rfind
Polish ladis by hr massiv, so-calld Russian typ of bauty. Th
mpror noticd hr and honord hr with a danc.
Borís Drubtskóy, having lft his wif in Moscow and bing for th
prsnt n garçon (as h phrasd it), was also thr and, though not an
aid-d-camp, had subscribd a larg sum toward th xpnss. Borís
was now a rich man who had risn to high honors and no longr sought
patronag but stood on an qual footing with th highst of thos of his
own ag. H was mting Hlèn in Vílna aftr not having sn hr for
a long tim and did not rcall th past, but as Hlèn was njoying
th favors of a vry important prsonag and Borís had only rcntly
marrid, thy mt as good frinds of long standing.
At midnight dancing was still going on. Hlèn, not having a suitabl
partnr, hrslf offrd to danc th mazurka with Borís. Thy wr th
third coupl. Borís, coolly looking at Hlèn’s dazzling bar shouldrs
which mrgd from a dark, gold-mbroidrd, gauz gown, talkd to hr
of old acquaintancs and at th sam tim, unawar of it himslf and
unnoticd by othrs, nvr for an instant casd to obsrv th mpror
who was in th sam room. Th mpror was not dancing, h stood in th
doorway, stopping now on pair and now anothr with gracious words which
h alon knw how to uttr.
As th mazurka bgan, Borís saw that Adjutant Gnral Balashëv, on of
thos in closst attndanc on th mpror, wnt up to him and contrary
to court tiqutt stood nar him whil h was talking to a Polish
lady. Having finishd spaking to hr, th mpror lookd inquiringly
at Balashëv and, vidntly undrstanding that h only actd thus bcaus
thr wr important rasons for so doing, noddd slightly to th lady
and turnd to him. Hardly had Balashëv bgun to spak bfor a look of
amazmnt appard on th mpror’s fac. H took Balashëv by th arm
and crossd th room with him, unconsciously claring a path svn
yards wid as th popl on both sids mad way for him. Borís noticd
Arakchv’s xcitd fac whn th sovrign wnt out with Balashëv.
Arakchv lookd at th mpror from undr his brow and, sniffing with
his rd nos, stppd forward from th crowd as if xpcting th mpror
to addrss him. (Borís undrstood that Arakchv nvid Balashëv and
was displasd that vidntly important nws had rachd th mpror
othrwis than through himslf.)
But th mpror and Balashëv passd out into th illuminatd gardn
without noticing Arakchv who, holding his sword and glancing
wrathfully around, followd som twnty pacs bhind thm.
All th tim Borís was going through th figurs of th mazurka, h was
worrid by th qustion of what nws Balashëv had brought and how h
could find it out bfor othrs. In th figur in which h had to choos
two ladis, h whisprd to Hlèn that h mant to choos Countss
Potocka who, h thought, had gon out onto th vranda, and glidd ovr
th parqut to th door opning into th gardn, whr, sing Balashëv
and th mpror rturning to th vranda, h stood still. Thy wr
moving toward th door. Borís, fluttring as if h had not had tim to
withdraw, rspctfully prssd clos to th doorpost with bowd had.
Th mpror, with th agitation of on who has bn prsonally
affrontd, was finishing with ths words:
“To ntr Russia without dclaring war! I will not mak pac as long as
a singl armd nmy rmains in my country!” It smd to Borís that it
gav th mpror plasur to uttr ths words. H was satisfid with
th form in which h had xprssd his thoughts, but displasd that
Borís had ovrhard it.
“Lt no on know of it!” th mpror addd with a frown.
Borís undrstood that this was mant for him and, closing his ys,
slightly bowd his had. Th mpror r-ntrd th ballroom and
rmaind thr about anothr half-hour.
Borís was thus th first to larn th nws that th Frnch army had
crossd th Nimn and, thanks to this, was abl to show crtain
important prsonags that much that was concald from othrs was
usually known to him, and by this mans h ros highr in thir
stimation.
Th unxpctd nws of th Frnch having crossd th Nimn was
particularly startling aftr a month of unfulfilld xpctations, and at
a ball. On first rciving th nws, undr th influnc of indignation
and rsntmnt th mpror had found a phras that plasd him, fully
xprssd his flings, and has sinc bcom famous. On rturning hom
at two o’clock that night h snt for his scrtary, Shishkóv, and told
him to writ an ordr to th troops and a rscript to Fild Marshal
Princ Saltykóv, in which h insistd on th words bing insrtd that
h would not mak pac so long as a singl armd Frnchman rmaind on
Russian soil.
Nxt day th following lttr was snt to Napolon:
Monsiur mon frèr,
Ystrday I larnd that, dspit th loyalty with which I hav kpt
my ngagmnts with Your Majsty, your troops hav crossd th Russian
frontir, and I hav this momnt rcivd from Ptrsburg a not, in
which Count Lauriston informs m, as a rason for this aggrssion, that
Your Majsty has considrd yourslf to b in a stat of war with m
from th tim Princ Kurákin askd for his passports. Th rasons on
which th Duc d Bassano basd his rfusal to dlivr thm to him would
nvr hav ld m to suppos that that could srv as a prtxt for
aggrssion. In fact, th ambassador, as h himslf has dclard, was
nvr authorizd to mak that dmand, and as soon as I was informd of
it I lt him know how much I disapprovd of it and ordrd him to rmain
at his post. If Your Majsty dos not intnd to shd th blood of our
popls for such a misundrstanding, and consnts to withdraw your
troops from Russian trritory, I will rgard what has passd as not
having occurrd and an undrstanding btwn us will b possibl. In
th contrary cas, Your Majsty, I shall s myslf forcd to rpl an
attack that nothing on my part has provokd. It still dpnds on Your
Majsty to prsrv humanity from th calamity of anothr war.
I am, tc.,
(signd) Alxandr
CHAPTR IV
At two in th morning of th fourtnth of Jun, th mpror, having
snt for Balashëv and rad him his lttr to Napolon, ordrd him to
tak it and hand it prsonally to th Frnch mpror. Whn dispatching
Balashëv, th mpror rpatd to him th words that h would not mak
pac so long as a singl armd nmy rmaind on Russian soil and told
him to transmit thos words to Napolon. Alxandr did not insrt thm
in his lttr to Napolon, bcaus with his charactristic tact h flt
it would b injudicious to us thm at a momnt whn a last attmpt at
rconciliation was bing mad, but h dfinitly instructd Balashëv to
rpat thm prsonally to Napolon.
Having st off in th small hours of th fourtnth, accompanid by a
buglr and two Cossacks, Balashëv rachd th Frnch outposts at th
villag of Rykónty, on th Russian sid of th Nimn, by dawn. Thr h
was stoppd by Frnch cavalry sntinls.
A Frnch noncommissiond officr of hussars, in crimson uniform and a
shaggy cap, shoutd to th approaching Balashëv to halt. Balashëv did
not do so at onc, but continud to advanc along th road at a walking
pac.
Th noncommissiond officr frownd and, muttring words of abus,
advancd his hors’s chst against Balashëv, put his hand to his sabr,
and shoutd rudly at th Russian gnral, asking: was h daf that
h did not do as h was told? Balashëv mntiond who h was. Th
noncommissiond officr bgan talking with his comrads about rgimntal
mattrs without looking at th Russian gnral.
Aftr living at th sat of th highst authority and powr, aftr
convrsing with th mpror lss than thr hours bfor, and in gnral
bing accustomd to th rspct du to his rank in th srvic, Balashëv
found it vry strang hr on Russian soil to ncountr this hostil,
and still mor this disrspctful, application of brut forc to
himslf.
Th sun was only just apparing from bhind th clouds, th air was
frsh and dwy. A hrd of cattl was bing drivn along th road from
th villag, and ovr th filds th larks ros trilling, on aftr
anothr, lik bubbls rising in watr.
Balashëv lookd around him, awaiting th arrival of an officr from th
villag. Th Russian Cossacks and buglr and th Frnch hussars lookd
silntly at on anothr from tim to tim.
A Frnch colonl of hussars, who had vidntly just lft his bd, cam
riding from th villag on a handsom slk gray hors, accompanid
by two hussars. Th officr, th soldirs, and thir horss all lookd
smart and wll kpt.
It was that first priod of a campaign whn troops ar still in full
trim, almost lik that of pactim manuvrs, but with a shad of
martial swaggr in thir cloths, and a touch of th gaity and spirit
of ntrpris which always accompany th opning of a campaign.
Th Frnch colonl with difficulty rprssd a yawn, but was polit and
vidntly undrstood Balashëv’s importanc. H ld him past his soldirs
and bhind th outposts and told him that his wish to b prsntd to
th mpror would most likly b satisfid immdiatly, as th mpror’s
quartrs wr, h blivd, not far off.
Thy rod through th villag of Rykónty, past tthrd Frnch hussar
horss, past sntinls and mn who salutd thir colonl and stard with
curiosity at a Russian uniform, and cam out at th othr nd of th
villag. Th colonl said that th commandr of th division was a mil
and a quartr away and would rciv Balashëv and conduct him to his
dstination.
Th sun had by now risn and shon gaily on th bright vrdur.
Thy had hardly riddn up a hill, past a tavrn, bfor thy saw a group
of horsmn coming toward thm. In front of th group, on a black hors
with trappings that glittrd in th sun, rod a tall man with plums
in his hat and black hair curling down to his shouldrs. H wor a rd
mantl, and strtchd his long lgs forward in Frnch fashion. This man
rod toward Balashëv at a gallop, his plums flowing and his gms and
gold lac glittring in th bright Jun sunshin.
Balashëv was only two horss’ lngth from th qustrian with th
braclts, plums, ncklacs, and gold mbroidry, who was galloping
toward him with a thatrically solmn countnanc, whn Julnr, th
Frnch colonl, whisprd rspctfully: “Th King of Napls!” It was,
in fact, Murat, now calld “King of Napls.” Though it was quit
incomprhnsibl why h should b King of Napls, h was calld so,
and was himslf convincd that h was so, and thrfor assumd a mor
solmn and important air than formrly. H was so sur that h rally
was th King of Napls that whn, on th v of his dpartur from that
city, whil walking through th strts with his wif, som Italians
calld out to him: “Viva il r!” * h turnd to his wif with a pnsiv
smil and said: “Poor fllows, thy don’t know that I am laving thm
tomorrow!”
    * “Long liv th king.”
But though h firmly blivd himslf to b King of Napls and pitid
th grif flt by th subjcts h was abandoning, lattrly, aftr h had
bn ordrd to rturn to military srvic—and spcially sinc his last
intrviw with Napolon in Danzig, whn his august brothr-in-law had
told him: “I mad you King that you should rign in my way, but not in
yours!”—h had chrfully takn up his familiar businss, and—lik a
wll-fd but not ovrfat hors that fls himslf in harnss and grows
skittish btwn th shafts—h drssd up in cloths as varigatd and
xpnsiv as possibl, and gaily and contntdly gallopd along th
roads of Poland, without himslf knowing why or whithr.
On sing th Russian gnral h thrw back his had, with its long hair
curling to his shouldrs, in a majstically royal mannr, and lookd
inquiringly at th Frnch colonl. Th colonl rspctfully informd His
Majsty of Balashëv’s mission, whos nam h could not pronounc.
“D Bal-machèv!” said th King (ovrcoming by his assuranc th
difficulty that had prsntd itslf to th colonl). “Charmd to
mak your acquaintanc, Gnral!” h addd, with a gstur of kingly
condscnsion.
As soon as th King bgan to spak loud and fast his royal dignity
instantly forsook him, and without noticing it h passd into his
natural ton of good-naturd familiarity. H laid his hand on th
withrs of Balashëv’s hors and said:
“Wll, Gnral, it all looks lik war,” as if rgrtting a circumstanc
of which h was unabl to judg.
“Your Majsty,” rplid Balashëv, “my mastr, th mpror, dos not
dsir war and as Your Majsty ss...” said Balashëv, using th words
Your Majsty at vry opportunity, with th affctation unavoidabl in
frquntly addrssing on to whom th titl was still a novlty.
Murat’s fac bamd with stupid satisfaction as h listnd to “Monsiur
d Bal-machèv.” But royaut oblig! * and h flt it incumbnt on
him, as a king and an ally, to confr on stat affairs with Alxandr’s
nvoy. H dismountd, took Balashëv’s arm, and moving a fw stps away
from his suit, which waitd rspctfully, bgan to pac up and down
with him, trying to spak significantly. H rfrrd to th fact that
th mpror Napolon had rsntd th dmand that h should withdraw his
troops from Prussia, spcially whn that dmand bcam gnrally known
and th dignity of Franc was thrby offndd.
    * “Royalty has its obligations.”
Balashëv rplid that thr was “nothing offnsiv in th dmand,
bcaus...” but Murat intrruptd him.
“Thn you don’t considr th mpror Alxandr th aggrssor?” h askd
unxpctdly, with a kindly and foolish smil.
Balashëv told him why h considrd Napolon to b th originator of th
war.
“Oh, my dar gnral!” Murat again intrruptd him, “with all my hart I
wish th mprors may arrang th affair btwn thm, and that th war
bgun by no wish of min may finish as quickly as possibl!” said h,
in th ton of a srvant who wants to rmain good frinds with anothr
dspit a quarrl btwn thir mastrs.
And h wnt on to inquiris about th Grand Duk and th stat of his
halth, and to rminiscncs of th gay and amusing tims h had spnt
with him in Napls. Thn suddnly, as if rmmbring his royal dignity,
Murat solmnly drw himslf up, assumd th pos in which h had stood
at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:
“I won’t dtain you longr, Gnral. I wish succss to your mission,”
and with his mbroidrd rd mantl, his flowing fathrs, and his
glittring ornamnts, h rjoind his suit who wr rspctfully
awaiting him.
Balashëv rod on, supposing from Murat’s words that h would vry soon
b brought bfor Napolon himslf. But instad of that, at th nxt
villag th sntinls of Davout’s infantry corps dtaind him as
th pickts of th vanguard had don, and an adjutant of th corps
commandr, who was ftchd, conductd him into th villag to Marshal
Davout.
CHAPTR V
Davout was to Napolon what Arakchv was to Alxandr—though not a
coward lik Arakchv, h was as prcis, as crul, and as unabl to
xprss his dvotion to his monarch xcpt by crulty.
In th organism of stats such mn ar ncssary, as wolvs ar
ncssary in th organism of natur, and thy always xist, always
appar and hold thir own, howvr incongruous thir prsnc and thir
proximity to th had of th govrnmnt may b. This invitability alon
can xplain how th crul Arakchv, who tor out a grnadir’s mustach
with his own hands, whos wak nrvs rndrd him unabl to fac
dangr, and who was nithr an ducatd man nor a courtir, was abl to
maintain his powrful position with Alxandr, whos own charactr was
chivalrous, nobl, and gntl.
Balashëv found Davout satd on a barrl in th shd of a pasant’s hut,
writing—h was auditing accounts. Bttr quartrs could hav bn
found him, but Marshal Davout was on of thos mn who purposly put
thmslvs in most dprssing conditions to hav a justification for
bing gloomy. For th sam rason thy ar always hard at work and in a
hurry. “How can I think of th bright sid of lif whn, as you s, I
am sitting on a barrl and working in a dirty shd?” th xprssion of
his fac smd to say. Th chif plasur and ncssity of such mn,
whn thy ncountr anyon who shows animation, is to flaunt thir own
drary, prsistnt activity. Davout allowd himslf that plasur whn
Balashëv was brought in. H bcam still mor absorbd in his task whn
th Russian gnral ntrd, and aftr glancing ovr his spctacls at
Balashëv’s fac, which was animatd by th bauty of th morning and
by his talk with Murat, h did not ris or vn stir, but scowld still
mor and snrd malvolntly.
Whn h noticd in Balashëv’s fac th disagrabl imprssion this
rcption producd, Davout raisd his had and coldly askd what h
wantd.
Thinking h could hav bn rcivd in such a mannr only bcaus
Davout did not know that h was adjutant gnral to th mpror
Alxandr and vn his nvoy to Napolon, Balashëv hastnd to inform
him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his xpctation, Davout, aftr
haring him, bcam still surlir and rudr.
“Whr is your dispatch?” h inquird. “Giv it to m. I will snd it to
th mpror.”
Balashëv rplid that h had bn ordrd to hand it prsonally to th
mpror.
“Your mpror’s ordrs ar obyd in your army, but hr,” said Davout,
“you must do as you’r told.”
And, as if to mak th Russian gnral still mor conscious of his
dpndnc on brut forc, Davout snt an adjutant to call th officr
on duty.
Balashëv took out th packt containing th mpror’s lttr and laid it
on th tabl (mad of a door with its hings still hanging on it, laid
across two barrls). Davout took th packt and rad th inscription.
“You ar prfctly at librty to trat m with rspct or not,”
protstd Balashëv, “but prmit m to obsrv that I hav th honor to
b adjutant gnral to His Majsty....”
Davout glancd at him silntly and plainly drivd plasur from th
signs of agitation and confusion which appard on Balashëv’s fac.
“You will b tratd as is fitting,” said h and, putting th packt in
his pockt, lft th shd.
A minut latr th marshal’s adjutant, d Castrès, cam in and conductd
Balashëv to th quartrs assignd him.
That day h dind with th marshal, at th sam board on th barrls.
Nxt day Davout rod out arly and, aftr asking Balashëv to com to
him, prmptorily rqustd him to rmain thr, to mov on with th
baggag train should ordrs com for it to mov, and to talk to no on
xcpt Monsiur d Castrès.
Aftr four days of solitud, nnui, and consciousnss of his impotnc
and insignificanc—particularly acut by contrast with th sphr of
powr in which h had so latly movd—and aftr svral marchs with
th marshal’s baggag and th Frnch army, which occupid th
whol district, Balashëv was brought to Vílna—now occupid by th
Frnch—through th vry gat by which h had lft it four days
prviously.
Nxt day th imprial gntlman-in-waiting, th Comt d Turnn, cam
to Balashëv and informd him of th mpror Napolon’s wish to honor him
with an audinc.
Four days bfor, sntinls of th Probrazhnsk rgimnt had stood in
front of th hous to which Balashëv was conductd, and now two Frnch
grnadirs stood thr in blu uniforms unfastnd in front and with
shaggy caps on thir hads, and an scort of hussars and Uhlans and a
brilliant suit of aids-d-camp, pags, and gnrals, who wr waiting
for Napolon to com out, wr standing at th porch, round his saddl
hors and his Mamluk, Rustan. Napolon rcivd Balashëv in th vry
hous in Vílna from which Alxandr had dispatchd him on his mission.
CHAPTR VI
Though Balashëv was usd to imprial pomp, h was amazd at th luxury
and magnificnc of Napolon’s court.
Th Comt d Turnn showd him into a big rcption room whr many
gnrals, gntlmn-in-waiting, and Polish magnats—svral of whom
Balashëv had sn at th court of th mpror of Russia—wr waiting.
Duroc said that Napolon would rciv th Russian gnral bfor going
for his rid.
Aftr som minuts, th gntlman-in-waiting who was on duty cam into
th grat rcption room and, bowing politly, askd Balashëv to follow
him.
Balashëv wnt into a small rcption room, on door of which ld into a
study, th vry on from which th Russian mpror had dispatchd him
on his mission. H stood a minut or two, waiting. H hard hurrid
footstps byond th door, both halvs of it wr opnd rapidly; all
was silnt and thn from th study th sound was hard of othr stps,
firm and rsolut—thy wr thos of Napolon. H had just finishd
drssing for his rid, and wor a blu uniform, opning in front ovr
a whit waistcoat so long that it covrd his rotund stomach, whit
lathr brchs tightly fitting th fat thighs of his short lgs, and
Hssian boots. His short hair had vidntly just bn brushd, but on
lock hung down in th middl of his broad forhad. His plump whit nck
stood out sharply abov th black collar of his uniform, and h smlld
of au d Cologn. His full fac, rathr young-looking, with its
prominnt chin, wor a gracious and majstic xprssion of imprial
wlcom.
H ntrd briskly, with a jrk at vry stp and his had slightly
thrown back. His whol short corpulnt figur with broad thick
shouldrs, and chst and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that
imposing and statly apparanc on ss in mn of forty who liv in
comfort. It was vidnt, too, that h was in th bst of spirits that
day.
H noddd in answr to Balashëv’s low and rspctful bow, and coming up
to him at onc bgan spaking lik a man who valus vry momnt of his
tim and dos not condscnd to prpar what h has to say but is sur
h will always say th right thing and say it wll.
“Good day, Gnral!” said h. “I hav rcivd th lttr you brought
from th mpror Alxandr and am vry glad to s you.” H glancd with
his larg ys into Balashëv’s fac and immdiatly lookd past him.
It was plain that Balashëv’s prsonality did not intrst him at all.
vidntly only what took plac within his own mind intrstd him.
Nothing outsid himslf had any significanc for him, bcaus vrything
in th world, it smd to him, dpndd ntirly on his will.
“I do not, and did not, dsir war,” h continud, “but it has bn
forcd on m. vn now” (h mphasizd th word) “I am rady to rciv
any xplanations you can giv m.”
And h bgan clarly and concisly to xplain his rasons for
dissatisfaction with th Russian govrnmnt. Judging by th calmly
modrat and amicabl ton in which th Frnch mpror spok, Balashëv
was firmly prsuadd that h wishd for pac and intndd to ntr into
ngotiations.
Whn Napolon, having finishd spaking, lookd inquiringly at th
Russian nvoy, Balashëv bgan a spch h had prpard long bfor:
“Sir! Th mpror, my mastr...” but th sight of th mpror’s ys
bnt on him confusd him. “You ar flurrid—compos yourslf!” Napolon
smd to say, as with a scarcly prcptibl smil h lookd at
Balashëv’s uniform and sword.
Balashëv rcovrd himslf and bgan to spak. H said that th
mpror Alxandr did not considr Kurákin’s dmand for his passports a
sufficint caus for war; that Kurákin had actd on his own initiativ
and without his sovrign’s assnt, that th mpror Alxandr did not
dsir war, and had no rlations with ngland.
“Not yt!” intrposd Napolon, and, as if faring to giv vnt to his
flings, h frownd and noddd slightly as a sign that Balashëv might
procd.
Aftr saying all h had bn instructd to say, Balashëv addd that
th mpror Alxandr wishd for pac, but would not ntr into
ngotiations xcpt on condition that... Hr Balashëv hsitatd:
h rmmbrd th words th mpror Alxandr had not writtn in his
lttr, but had spcially insrtd in th rscript to Saltykóv and had
told Balashëv to rpat to Napolon. Balashëv rmmbrd ths words,
“So long as a singl armd fo rmains on Russian soil,” but som
complx fling rstraind him. H could not uttr thm, though h
wishd to do so. H grw confusd and said: “On condition that th
Frnch army rtirs byond th Nimn.”
Napolon noticd Balashëv’s mbarrassmnt whn uttring ths last
words; his fac twitchd and th calf of his lft lg bgan to quivr
rhythmically. Without moving from whr h stood h bgan spaking in
a loudr ton and mor hurridly than bfor. During th spch that
followd, Balashëv, who mor than onc lowrd his ys, involuntarily
noticd th quivring of Napolon’s lft lg which incrasd th mor
Napolon raisd his voic.
“I dsir pac, no lss than th mpror Alxandr,” h bgan. “Hav
I not for ightn months bn doing vrything to obtain it? I
hav waitd ightn months for xplanations. But in ordr to bgin
ngotiations, what is dmandd of m?” h said, frowning and making an
nrgtic gstur of inquiry with his small whit plump hand.
“Th withdrawal of your army byond th Nimn, sir,” rplid Balashëv.
“Th Nimn?” rpatd Napolon. “So now you want m to rtir byond
th Nimn—only th Nimn?” rpatd Napolon, looking straight at
Balashëv.
Th lattr bowd his had rspctfully.
Instad of th dmand of four months arlir to withdraw from Pomrania,
only a withdrawal byond th Nimn was now dmandd. Napolon turnd
quickly and bgan to pac th room.
“You say th dmand now is that I am to withdraw byond th Nimn
bfor commncing ngotiations, but in just th sam way two months ago
th dmand was that I should withdraw byond th Vistula and th Odr,
and yt you ar willing to ngotiat.”
H wnt in silnc from on cornr of th room to th othr and again
stoppd in front of Balashëv. Balashëv noticd that his lft lg was
quivring fastr than bfor and his fac smd ptrifid in its strn
xprssion. This quivring of his lft lg was a thing Napolon was
conscious of. “Th vibration of my lft calf is a grat sign with m,”
h rmarkd at a latr dat.
“Such dmands as to rtrat byond th Vistula and Odr may b mad to a
Princ of Badn, but not to m!” Napolon almost scramd, quit to his
own surpris. “If you gav m Ptrsburg and Moscow I could not accpt
such conditions. You say I hav bgun this war! But who first joind his
army? Th mpror Alxandr, not I! And you offr m ngotiations whn I
hav xpndd millions, whn you ar in allianc with ngland, and whn
your position is a bad on. You offr m ngotiations! But what is th
aim of your allianc with ngland? What has sh givn you?” h continud
hurridly, vidntly no longr trying to show th advantags of pac
and discuss its possibility, but only to prov his own rctitud and
powr and Alxandr’s rrors and duplicity.
Th commncmnt of his spch had obviously bn mad with th
intntion of dmonstrating th advantags of his position and showing
that h was nvrthlss willing to ngotiat. But h had bgun talking,
and th mor h talkd th lss could h control his words.
Th whol purport of his rmarks now was vidntly to xalt himslf and
insult Alxandr—just what h had last dsird at th commncmnt of
th intrviw.
“I har you hav mad pac with Turky?”
Balashëv bowd his had affirmativly.
“Pac has bn concludd...” h bgan.
But Napolon did not lt him spak. H vidntly wantd to do all th
talking himslf, and continud to talk with th sort of loqunc and
unrstraind irritability to which spoild popl ar so pron.
“Ys, I know you hav mad pac with th Turks without obtaining
Moldavia and Wallachia; I would hav givn your sovrign thos
provincs as I gav him Finland. Ys,” h wnt on, “I promisd and would
hav givn th mpror Alxandr Moldavia and Wallachia, and now h
won’t hav thos splndid provincs. Yt h might hav unitd thm to
his mpir and in a singl rign would hav xtndd Russia from th
Gulf of Bothnia to th mouths of th Danub. Cathrin th Grat could
not hav don mor,” said Napolon, growing mor and mor xcitd as h
pacd up and down th room, rpating to Balashëv almost th vry words
h had usd to Alxandr himslf at Tilsit. “All that, h would hav
owd to my frindship. Oh, what a splndid rign!” h rpatd svral
tims, thn pausd, drw from his pockt a gold snuffbox, liftd it to
his nos, and grdily sniffd at it.
“What a splndid rign th mpror Alxandr’s might hav bn!”
H lookd compassionatly at Balashëv, and as soon as th lattr trid
to mak som rjoindr hastily intrruptd him.
“What could h wish or look for that h would not hav obtaind
through my frindship?” dmandd Napolon, shrugging his shouldrs
in prplxity. “But no, h has prfrrd to surround himslf with
my nmis, and with whom? With Stins, Armfldts, Bnnigsns, and
Wintzingrods! Stin, a traitor xplld from his own country;
Armfldt, a rak and an intrigur; Wintzingrod, a fugitiv Frnch
subjct; Bnnigsn, rathr mor of a soldir than th othrs, but all
th sam an incomptnt who was unabl to do anything in 1807 and who
should awakn trribl mmoris in th mpror Alxandr’s mind....
Grantd that wr thy comptnt thy might b mad us of,” continud
Napolon—hardly abl to kp pac in words with th rush of thoughts
that incssantly sprang up, proving how right and strong h was (in his
prcption th two wr on and th sam)—“but thy ar not vn that!
Thy ar nithr fit for war nor pac! Barclay is said to b th
most capabl of thm all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first
movmnts. And what ar thy doing, all ths courtirs? Pful proposs,
Armfldt disputs, Bnnigsn considrs, and Barclay, calld on to act,
dos not know what to dcid on, and tim passs bringing no rsult.
Bagratión alon is a military man. H’s stupid, but h has xprinc,
a quick y, and rsolution.... And what rol is your young monarch
playing in that monstrous crowd? Thy compromis him and throw on him
th rsponsibility for all that happns. A sovrign should not b with
th army unlss h is a gnral!” said Napolon, vidntly uttring
ths words as a dirct challng to th mpror. H knw how Alxandr
dsird to b a military commandr.
“Th campaign bgan only a wk ago, and you havn’t vn bn abl to
dfnd Vílna. You ar cut in two and hav bn drivn out of th Polish
provincs. Your army is grumbling.”
“On th contrary, Your Majsty,” said Balashëv, hardly abl to rmmbr
what had bn said to him and following ths vrbal firworks with
difficulty, “th troops ar burning with agrnss...”
“I know vrything!” Napolon intrruptd him. “I know vrything. I
know th numbr of your battalions as xactly as I know my own. You hav
not two hundrd thousand mn, and I hav thr tims that numbr. I giv
you my word of honor,” said Napolon, forgtting that his word of honor
could carry no wight—“I giv you my word of honor that I hav fiv
hundrd and thirty thousand mn this sid of th Vistula. Th Turks will
b of no us to you; thy ar worth nothing and hav shown it by making
pac with you. As for th Swds—it is thir fat to b govrnd by
mad kings. Thir king was insan and thy changd him for
anothr—Brnadott, who promptly wnt mad—for no Swd would ally
himslf with Russia unlss h wr mad.”
Napolon grinnd maliciously and again raisd his snuffbox to his nos.
Balashëv knw how to rply to ach of Napolon’s rmarks, and would
hav don so; h continually mad th gstur of a man wishing to say
somthing, but Napolon always intrruptd him. To th allgd insanity
of th Swds, Balashëv wishd to rply that whn Russia is on hr sid
Swdn is practically an island: but Napolon gav an angry xclamation
to drown his voic. Napolon was in that stat of irritability in which
a man has to talk, talk, and talk, mrly to convinc himslf that h is
in th right. Balashëv bgan to fl uncomfortabl: as nvoy h fard
to dman his dignity and flt th ncssity of rplying; but, as a man,
h shrank bfor th transport of groundlss wrath that had vidntly
sizd Napolon. H knw that non of th words now uttrd by Napolon
had any significanc, and that Napolon himslf would b ashamd of thm
whn h cam to his snss. Balashëv stood with downcast ys, looking
at th movmnts of Napolon’s stout lgs and trying to avoid mting
his ys.
“But what do I car about your allis?” said Napolon. “I hav
allis—th Pols. Thr ar ighty thousand of thm and thy fight lik
lions. And thr will b two hundrd thousand of thm.”
And probably still mor prturbd by th fact that h had uttrd this
obvious falshood, and that Balashëv still stood silntly bfor him in
th sam attitud of submission to fat, Napolon abruptly turnd
round, drw clos to Balashëv’s fac, and, gsticulating rapidly and
nrgtically with his whit hands, almost shoutd:
“Know that if you stir up Prussia against m, I’ll wip it off th map
of urop!” h dclard, his fac pal and distortd by angr, and h
struck on of his small hands nrgtically with th othr. “Ys, I
will throw you back byond th Dvína and byond th Dnipr, and will
r-rct against you that barrir which it was criminal and blind of
urop to allow to b dstroyd. Ys, that is what will happn to you.
That is what you hav gaind by alinating m!” And h walkd silntly
svral tims up and down th room, his fat shouldrs twitching.
H put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pockt, took it out again, liftd
it svral tims to his nos, and stoppd in front of Balashëv. H
pausd, lookd ironically straight into Balashëv’s ys, and said in a
quit voic:
“And yt what a splndid rign your mastr might hav had!”
Balashëv, fling it incumbnt on him to rply, said that from th
Russian sid things did not appar in so gloomy a light. Napolon was
silnt, still looking drisivly at him and vidntly not listning to
him. Balashëv said that in Russia th bst rsults wr xpctd from
th war. Napolon noddd condscndingly, as if to say, “I know it’s
your duty to say that, but you don’t bliv it yourslf. I hav
convincd you.”
Whn Balashëv had ndd, Napolon again took out his snuffbox, sniffd
at it, and stampd his foot twic on th floor as a signal. Th door
opnd, a gntlman-in-waiting, bnding rspctfully, handd th mpror
his hat and glovs; anothr brought him a pockt handkrchif. Napolon,
without giving thm a glanc, turnd to Balashëv:
“Assur th mpror Alxandr from m,” said h, taking his hat, “that
I am as dvotd to him as bfor: I know him thoroughly and vry highly
stm his lofty qualitis. I will dtain you no longr, Gnral; you
shall rciv my lttr to th mpror.”
And Napolon wnt quickly to th door. vryon in th rcption room
rushd forward and dscndd th staircas.
CHAPTR VII
Aftr all that Napolon had said to him—thos bursts of angr and th
last dryly spokn words: “I will dtain you no longr, Gnral; you
shall rciv my lttr,” Balashëv flt convincd that Napolon would
not wish to s him, and would vn avoid anothr mting with him—an
insultd nvoy—spcially as h had witnssd his unsmly angr. But,
to his surpris, Balashëv rcivd, through Duroc, an invitation to din
with th mpror that day.
Bssièrs, Caulaincourt, and Brthir wr prsnt at that dinnr.
Napolon mt Balashëv chrfully and amiably. H not only showd no sign
of constraint or slf-rproach on account of his outburst that morning,
but, on th contrary, trid to rassur Balashëv. It was vidnt that
h had long bn convincd that it was impossibl for him to mak a
mistak, and that in his prcption whatvr h did was right, not
bcaus it harmonizd with any ida of right and wrong, but bcaus h
did it.
Th mpror was in vry good spirits aftr his rid through Vílna, whr
crowds of popl had rapturously grtd and followd him. From all
th windows of th strts through which h rod, rugs, flags, and his
monogram wr displayd, and th Polish ladis, wlcoming him, wavd
thir handkrchifs to him.
At dinnr, having placd Balashëv bsid him, Napolon not only tratd
him amiably but bhavd as if Balashëv wr on of his own courtirs,
on of thos who sympathizd with his plans and ought to rjoic at
his succss. In th cours of convrsation h mntiond Moscow and
qustiond Balashëv about th Russian capital, not mrly as an
intrstd travlr asks about a nw city h intnds to visit, but as
if convincd that Balashëv, as a Russian, must b flattrd by his
curiosity.
“How many inhabitants ar thr in Moscow? How many houss? Is it tru
that Moscow is calld ‘Holy Moscow’? How many churchs ar thr in
Moscow?” h askd.
And rciving th rply that thr wr mor than two hundrd churchs,
h rmarkd:
“Why such a quantity of churchs?”
“Th Russians ar vry dvout,” rplid Balashëv.
“But a larg numbr of monastris and churchs is always a sign of th
backwardnss of a popl,” said Napolon, turning to Caulaincourt for
apprciation of this rmark.
Balashëv rspctfully vnturd to disagr with th Frnch mpror.
“vry country has its own charactr,” said h.
“But nowhr in urop is thr anything lik that,” said Napolon.
“I bg your Majsty’s pardon,” rturnd Balashëv, “bsids Russia thr
is Spain, whr thr ar also many churchs and monastris.”
This rply of Balashëv’s, which hintd at th rcnt dfats of th
Frnch in Spain, was much apprciatd whn h rlatd it at Alxandr’s
court, but it was not much apprciatd at Napolon’s dinnr, whr it
passd unnoticd.
Th unintrstd and prplxd facs of th marshals showd that thy
wr puzzld as to what Balashëv’s ton suggstd. “If thr is a point
w don’t s it, or it is not at all witty,” thir xprssions smd
to say. So littl was his rjoindr apprciatd that Napolon did not
notic it at all and naïvly askd Balashëv through what towns th
dirct road from thr to Moscow passd. Balashëv, who was on th alrt
all through th dinnr, rplid that just as “all roads lad to Rom,”
so all roads lad to Moscow: thr wr many roads, and “among thm th
road through Poltáva, which Charls XII chos.” Balashëv involuntarily
flushd with plasur at th aptitud of this rply, but hardly had
h uttrd th word Poltáva bfor Caulaincourt bgan spaking of th
badnss of th road from Ptrsburg to Moscow and of his Ptrsburg
rminiscncs.
Aftr dinnr thy wnt to drink coff in Napolon’s study, which four
days prviously had bn that of th mpror Alxandr. Napolon sat
down, toying with his Sèvrs coff cup, and motiond Balashëv to a
chair bsid him.
Napolon was in that wll-known aftr-dinnr mood which, mor than
any rasond caus, maks a man contntd with himslf and disposd to
considr vryon his frind. It smd to him that h was surroundd
by mn who adord him: and h flt convincd that, aftr his dinnr,
Balashëv too was his frind and worshipr. Napolon turnd to him with a
plasant, though slightly ironic, smil.
“Thy tll m this is th room th mpror Alxandr occupid? Strang,
isn’t it, Gnral?” h said, vidntly not doubting that this rmark
would b agrabl to his harr sinc it wnt to prov his, Napolon’s,
supriority to Alxandr.
Balashëv mad no rply and bowd his had in silnc.
“Ys. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingrod and Stin wr
dlibrating,” continud Napolon with th sam drisiv and
slf-confidnt smil. “What I can’t undrstand,” h wnt on, “is that
th mpror Alxandr has surroundd himslf with my prsonal nmis.
That I do not... undrstand. Has h not thought that I may do th sam?”
and h turnd inquiringly to Balashëv, and vidntly this thought turnd
him back on to th track of his morning’s angr, which was still frsh
in him.
“And lt him know that I will do so!” said Napolon, rising and pushing
his cup away with his hand. “I’ll driv all his Württmbrg, Badn, and
Wimar rlations out of Grmany.... Ys. I’ll driv thm out. Lt him
prpar an asylum for thm in Russia!”
Balashëv bowd his had with an air indicating that h would lik to
mak his bow and lav, and only listnd bcaus h could not hlp
haring what was said to him. Napolon did not notic this xprssion;
h tratd Balashëv not as an nvoy from his nmy, but as a man
now fully dvotd to him and who must rjoic at his formr mastr’s
humiliation.
“And why has th mpror Alxandr takn command of th armis? What is
th good of that? War is my profssion, but his businss is to rign
and not to command armis! Why has h takn on himslf such a
rsponsibility?”
Again Napolon brought out his snuffbox, pacd svral tims up and down
th room in silnc, and thn, suddnly and unxpctdly, wnt up to
Balashëv and with a slight smil, as confidntly, quickly, and simply
as if h wr doing somthing not mrly important but plasing to
Balashëv, h raisd his hand to th forty-yar-old Russian gnral’s
fac and, taking him by th ar, pulld it gntly, smiling with his lips
only.
To hav on’s ar pulld by th mpror was considrd th gratst
honor and mark of favor at th Frnch court.
“Wll, adorr and courtir of th mpror Alxandr, why don’t you say
anything?” said h, as if it was ridiculous, in his prsnc, to b th
adorr and courtir of anyon but himslf, Napolon. “Ar th horss
rady for th gnral?” h addd, with a slight inclination of his had
in rply to Balashëv’s bow. “Lt him hav min, h has a long way to
go!”
Th lttr takn by Balashëv was th last Napolon snt to Alxandr.
vry dtail of th intrviw was communicatd to th Russian monarch,
and th war bgan....
CHAPTR VIII
Aftr his intrviw with Pirr in Moscow, Princ Andrw wnt to
Ptrsburg, on businss as h told his family, but rally to mt
Anatol Kurágin whom h flt it ncssary to ncountr. On raching
Ptrsburg h inquird for Kurágin but th lattr had alrady lft th
city. Pirr had warnd his brothr-in-law that Princ Andrw was on
his track. Anatol Kurágin promptly obtaind an appointmnt from
th Ministr of War and wnt to join th army in Moldavia. Whil in
Ptrsburg Princ Andrw mt Kutúzov, his formr commandr who was
always wll disposd toward him, and Kutúzov suggstd that h should
accompany him to th army in Moldavia, to which th old gnral had
bn appointd commandr in chif. So Princ Andrw, having rcivd an
appointmnt on th hadquartrs staff, lft for Turky.
Princ Andrw did not think it propr to writ and challng Kurágin.
H thought that if h challngd him without som frsh caus it might
compromis th young Countss Rostóva and so h wantd to mt Kurágin
prsonally in ordr to find a frsh prtxt for a dul. But h again
faild to mt Kurágin in Turky, for soon aftr Princ Andrw arrivd,
th lattr rturnd to Russia. In a nw country, amid nw conditions,
Princ Andrw found lif asir to bar. Aftr his btrothd had brokn
faith with him—which h flt th mor acutly th mor h trid to
concal its ffcts—th surroundings in which h had bn happy bcam
trying to him, and th frdom and indpndnc h had onc prizd
so highly wr still mor so. Not only could h no longr think th
thoughts that had first com to him as h lay gazing at th sky on th
fild of Austrlitz and had latr nlargd upon with Pirr, and which
had filld his solitud at Boguchárovo and thn in Switzrland and Rom,
but h vn dradd to rcall thm and th bright and boundlss horizons
thy had rvald. H was now concrnd only with th narst practical
mattrs unrlatd to his past intrsts, and h sizd on ths th mor
agrly th mor thos past intrsts wr closd to him. It was as if
that lofty, infinit canopy of havn that had onc towrd abov him
had suddnly turnd into a low, solid vault that wighd him down, in
which all was clar, but nothing trnal or mystrious.
Of th activitis that prsntd thmslvs to him, army srvic was th
simplst and most familiar. As a gnral on duty on Kutúzov’s staff,
h applid himslf to businss with zal and prsvranc and surprisd
Kutúzov by his willingnss and accuracy in work. Not having found
Kurágin in Turky, Princ Andrw did not think it ncssary to rush back
to Russia aftr him, but all th sam h knw that howvr long it might
b bfor h mt Kurágin, dspit his contmpt for him and dspit all
th proofs h dducd to convinc himslf that it was not worth stooping
to a conflict with him—h knw that whn h did mt him h would not
b abl to rsist calling him out, any mor than a ravnous man can hlp
snatching at food. And th consciousnss that th insult was not yt
avngd, that his rancor was still unspnt, wighd on his hart and
poisond th artificial tranquillity which h managd to obtain in
Turky by mans of rstlss, plodding, and rathr vainglorious and
ambitious activity.
In th yar 1812, whn nws of th war with Napolon rachd
Bucharst—whr Kutúzov had bn living for two months, passing his
days and nights with a Wallachian woman—Princ Andrw askd Kutúzov
to transfr him to th Wstrn Army. Kutúzov, who was alrady wary of
Bolkónski’s activity which smd to rproach his own idlnss, vry
radily lt him go and gav him a mission to Barclay d Tolly.
Bfor joining th Wstrn Army which was thn, in May, ncampd at
Drissa, Princ Andrw visitd Bald Hills which was dirctly on his way,
bing only two mils off th Smolnsk highroad. During th last thr
yars thr had bn so many changs in his lif, h had thought, flt,
and sn so much (having travld both in th ast and th wst), that
on raching Bald Hills it struck him as strang and unxpctd to find
th way of lif thr unchangd and still th sam in vry dtail.
H ntrd through th gats with thir ston pillars and drov up
th avnu lading to th hous as if h wr ntring an nchantd,
slping castl. Th sam old statlinss, th sam clanlinss, th
sam stillnss rignd thr, and insid thr was th sam furnitur,
th sam walls, sounds, and smll, and th sam timid facs, only
somwhat oldr. Princss Mary was still th sam timid, plain maidn
gtting on in yars, uslssly and joylssly passing th bst yars of
hr lif in far and constant suffring. Madmoisll Bourinn was
th sam coquttish, slf-satisfid girl, njoying vry momnt of hr
xistnc and full of joyous hops for th futur. Sh had mrly bcom
mor slf-confidnt, Princ Andrw thought. Dssalls, th tutor h had
brought from Switzrland, was waring a coat of Russian cut and
talking brokn Russian to th srvants, but was still th sam narrowly
intllignt, conscintious, and pdantic prcptor. Th old princ
had changd in apparanc only by th loss of a tooth, which lft a
noticabl gap on on sid of his mouth; in charactr h was th sam as
vr, only showing still mor irritability and skpticism as to what was
happning in th world. Littl Nicholas alon had changd. H had grown,
bcom rosir, had curly dark hair, and, whn mrry and laughing, quit
unconsciously liftd th uppr lip of his prtty littl mouth just
as th littl princss usd to do. H alon did not oby th law of
immutability in th nchantd, slping castl. But though xtrnally
all rmaind as of old, th innr rlations of all ths popl had
changd sinc Princ Andrw had sn thm last. Th houshold was
dividd into two alin and hostil camps, who changd thir habits for
his sak and only mt bcaus h was thr. To th on camp blongd
th old princ, Madmoisll Bourinn, and th architct; to th othr
Princss Mary, Dssalls, littl Nicholas, and all th old nurss and
maids.
During his stay at Bald Hills all th family dind togthr, but thy
wr ill at as and Princ Andrw flt that h was a visitor for whos
sak an xcption was bing mad and that his prsnc mad thm all
fl awkward. Involuntarily fling this at dinnr on th first day, h
was taciturn, and th old princ noticing this also bcam morosly dumb
and rtird to his apartmnts dirctly aftr dinnr. In th vning,
whn Princ Andrw wnt to him and, trying to rous him, bgan to
tll him of th young Count Kámnsky’s campaign, th old princ
bgan unxpctdly to talk about Princss Mary, blaming hr for hr
suprstitions and hr dislik of Madmoisll Bourinn, who, h said,
was th only prson rally attachd to him.
Th old princ said that if h was ill it was only bcaus of Princss
Mary: that sh purposly worrid and irritatd him, and that by
indulgnc and silly talk sh was spoiling littl Princ Nicholas. Th
old princ knw vry wll that h tormntd his daughtr and that hr
lif was vry hard, but h also knw that h could not hlp tormnting
hr and that sh dsrvd it. “Why dos Princ Andrw, who ss this,
say nothing to m about his sistr? Dos h think m a scoundrl, or an
old fool who, without any rason, kps his own daughtr at a distanc
and attachs this Frnchwoman to himslf? H dosn’t undrstand, so I
must xplain it, and h must har m out,” thought th old princ.
And h bgan xplaining why h could not put up with his daughtr’s
unrasonabl charactr.
“If you ask m,” said Princ Andrw, without looking up (h was
cnsuring his fathr for th first tim in his lif), “I did not wish to
spak about it, but as you ask m I will giv you my frank opinion. If
thr is any misundrstanding and discord btwn you and Mary, I can’t
blam hr for it at all. I know how sh lovs and rspcts you. Sinc
you ask m,” continud Princ Andrw, bcoming irritabl—as h was
always liabl to do of lat—“I can only say that if thr ar any
misundrstandings thy ar causd by that worthlss woman, who is not
fit to b my sistr’s companion.”
Th old man at first stard fixdly at his son, and an unnatural smil
disclosd th frsh gap btwn his tth to which Princ Andrw could
not gt accustomd.
“What companion, my dar boy? h? You’v alrady bn talking it ovr!
h?”
“Fathr, I did not want to judg,” said Princ Andrw, in a hard and
bittr ton, “but you challngd m, and I hav said, and always shall
say, that Mary is not to blam, but thos to blam—th on to blam—is
that Frnchwoman.”
“Ah, h has passd judgmnt... passd judgmnt!” said th old man in a
low voic and, as it smd to Princ Andrw, with som mbarrassmnt,
but thn h suddnly jumpd up and crid: “B off, b off! Lt not a
trac of you rmain hr!...”
Princ Andrw wishd to lav at onc, but Princss Mary prsuadd him
to stay anothr day. That day h did not s his fathr, who did not
lav his room and admittd no on but Madmoisll Bourinn and
Tíkhon, but askd svral tims whthr his son had gon. Nxt day,
bfor laving, Princ Andrw wnt to his son’s rooms. Th boy,
curly-hadd lik his mothr and glowing with halth, sat on his kn,
and Princ Andrw bgan tlling him th story of Blubard, but fll
into a rvri without finishing th story. H thought not of this
prtty child, his son whom h hld on his kn, but of himslf. H
sought in himslf ithr rmors for having angrd his fathr or rgrt
at laving hom for th first tim in his lif on bad trms with him,
and was horrifid to find nithr. What mant still mor to him was that
h sought and did not find in himslf th formr tndrnss for his son
which h had hopd to rawakn by carssing th boy and taking him on
his kn.
“Wll, go on!” said his son.
Princ Andrw, without rplying, put him down from his kn and wnt out
of th room.
As soon as Princ Andrw had givn up his daily occupations, and
spcially on rturning to th old conditions of lif amid which h had
bn happy, warinss of lif ovrcam him with its formr intnsity,
and h hastnd to scap from ths mmoris and to find som work as
soon as possibl.
“So you’v dcidd to go, Andrw?” askd his sistr.
“Thank God that I can,” rplid Princ Andrw. “I am vry sorry you
can’t.”
“Why do you say that?” rplid Princss Mary. “Why do you say that,
whn you ar going to this trribl war, and h is so old? Madmoisll
Bourinn says h has bn asking about you....”
As soon as sh bgan to spak of that, hr lips trmbld and hr tars
bgan to fall. Princ Andrw turnd away and bgan pacing th room.
“Ah, my God! my God! Whn on thinks who and what—what trash—can caus
popl misry!” h said with a malignity that alarmd Princss Mary.
Sh undrstood that whn spaking of “trash” h rfrrd not only to
Madmoisll Bourinn, th caus of hr misry, but also to th man who
had ruind his own happinss.
“Andrw! On thing I bg, I ntrat of you!” sh said, touching his
lbow and looking at him with ys that shon through hr tars. “I
undrstand you” (sh lookd down). “Don’t imagin that sorrow is th
work of mn. Mn ar His tools.” Sh lookd a littl abov Princ
Andrw’s had with th confidnt, accustomd look with which on looks
at th plac whr a familiar portrait hangs. “Sorrow is snt by Him,
not by mn. Mn ar His instrumnts, thy ar not to blam. If you think
somon has wrongd you, forgt it and forgiv! W hav no right to
punish. And thn you will know th happinss of forgiving.”
“If I wr a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman’s virtu. But
a man should not and cannot forgiv and forgt,” h rplid, and though
till that momnt h had not bn thinking of Kurágin, all his unxpndd
angr suddnly swlld up in his hart.
“If Mary is alrady prsuading m to forgiv, it mans that I ought long
ago to hav punishd him,” h thought. And giving hr no furthr rply,
h bgan thinking of th glad vindictiv momnt whn h would mt
Kurágin who h knw was now in th army.
Princss Mary bggd him to stay on day mor, saying that sh knw how
unhappy hr fathr would b if Andrw lft without bing rconcild to
him, but Princ Andrw rplid that h would probably soon b back again
from th army and would crtainly writ to his fathr, but that th
longr h stayd now th mor mbittrd thir diffrncs would bcom.
“Good-by, Andrw! Rmmbr that misfortuns com from God, and mn ar
nvr to blam,” wr th last words h hard from his sistr whn h
took lav of hr.
“Thn it must b so!” thought Princ Andrw as h drov out of th
avnu from th hous at Bald Hills. “Sh, poor innocnt cratur, is
lft to b victimizd by an old man who has outlivd his wits. Th old
man fls h is guilty, but cannot chang himslf. My boy is growing up
and rjoics in lif, in which lik vrybody ls h will dciv or b
dcivd. And I am off to th army. Why? I myslf don’t know. I want
to mt that man whom I dspis, so as to giv him a chanc to kill and
laugh at m!”
Ths conditions of lif had bn th sam bfor, but thn thy wr
all connctd, whil now thy had all tumbld to pics. Only snslss
things, lacking cohrnc, prsntd thmslvs on aftr anothr to
Princ Andrw’s mind.
CHAPTR IX
Princ Andrw rachd th gnral hadquartrs of th army at th nd of
Jun. Th first army, with which was th mpror, occupid th fortifid
camp at Drissa; th scond army was rtrating, trying to ffct a
junction with th first on from which it was said to b cut off by
larg Frnch forcs. vryon was dissatisfid with th gnral cours
of affairs in th Russian army, but no on anticipatd any dangr of
invasion of th Russian provincs, and no on thought th war would
xtnd farthr than th wstrn, th Polish, provincs.
Princ Andrw found Barclay d Tolly, to whom h had bn assignd, on
th bank of th Drissa. As thr was not a singl town or larg
villag in th vicinity of th camp, th immns numbr of gnrals and
courtirs accompanying th army wr living in th bst houss of th
villags on both sids of th rivr, ovr a radius of six mils. Barclay
d Tolly was quartrd narly thr mils from th mpror. H rcivd
Bolkónski stiffly and coldly and told him in his forign accnt that h
would mntion him to th mpror for a dcision as to his mploymnt,
but askd him manwhil to rmain on his staff. Anatol Kurágin, whom
Princ Andrw had hopd to find with th army, was not thr. H had
gon to Ptrsburg, but Princ Andrw was glad to har this. His mind
was occupid by th intrsts of th cntr that was conducting
a gigantic war, and h was glad to b fr for a whil from th
distraction causd by th thought of Kurágin. During th first four
days, whil no dutis wr rquird of him, Princ Andrw rod round th
whol fortifid camp and, by th aid of his own knowldg and by
talks with xprts, trid to form a dfinit opinion about it. But th
qustion whthr th camp was advantagous or disadvantagous rmaind
for him undcidd. Alrady from his military xprinc and what h had
sn in th Austrian campaign, h had com to th conclusion that in
war th most dply considrd plans hav no significanc and that all
dpnds on th way unxpctd movmnts of th nmy—that cannot b
forsn—ar mt, and on how and by whom th whol mattr is handld.
To clar up this last point for himslf, Princ Andrw, utilizing his
position and acquaintancs, trid to fathom th charactr of th control
of th army and of th mn and partis ngagd in it, and h dducd for
himslf th following of th stat of affairs.
Whil th mpror had still bn at Vílna, th forcs had bn dividd
into thr armis. First, th army undr Barclay d Tolly, scondly, th
army undr Bagratión, and thirdly, th on commandd by Tormásov. Th
mpror was with th first army, but not as commandr in chif. In th
ordrs issud it was statd, not that th mpror would tak command,
but only that h would b with th army. Th mpror, morovr, had
with him not a commandr in chif’s staff but th imprial hadquartrs
staff. In attndanc on him was th had of th imprial staff,
Quartrmastr Gnral Princ Volkónski, as wll as gnrals, imprial
aids-d-camp, diplomatic officials, and a larg numbr of forignrs,
but not th army staff. Bsids ths, thr wr in attndanc on th
mpror without any dfinit appointmnts: Arakchv, th x-Ministr
of War; Count Bnnigsn, th snior gnral in rank; th Grand Duk
Tsarvich Constantin Pávlovich; Count Rumyántsv, th Chancllor;
Stin, a formr Prussian ministr; Armfldt, a Swdish gnral; Pful,
th chif author of th plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant gnral
and Sardinian migr; Wolzogn—and many othrs. Though ths mn had no
military appointmnt in th army, thir position gav thm influnc,
and oftn a corps commandr, or vn th commandr in chif, did not
know in what capacity h was qustiond by Bnnigsn, th Grand Duk,
Arakchv, or Princ Volkónski, or was givn this or that advic and did
not know whthr a crtain ordr rcivd in th form of advic manatd
from th man who gav it or from th mpror and whthr it had to b
xcutd or not. But this was only th xtrnal condition; th ssntial
significanc of th prsnc of th mpror and of all ths popl,
from a courtir’s point of viw (and in an mpror’s vicinity all bcam
courtirs), was clar to vryon. It was this: th mpror did not
assum th titl of commandr in chif, but disposd of all th armis;
th mn around him wr his assistants. Arakchv was a faithful
custodian to nforc ordr and actd as th sovrign’s bodyguard.
Bnnigsn was a landlord in th Vílna provinc who appard to b doing
th honors of th district, but was in rality a good gnral, usful
as an advisr and rady at hand to rplac Barclay. Th Grand Duk
was thr bcaus it suitd him to b. Th x-Ministr Stin was thr
bcaus his advic was usful and th mpror Alxandr hld him in high
stm prsonally. Armfldt virulntly hatd Napolon and was a gnral
full of slf-confidnc, a quality that always influncd Alxandr.
Paulucci was thr bcaus h was bold and dcidd in spch. Th
adjutants gnral wr thr bcaus thy always accompanid th
mpror, and lastly and chifly Pful was thr bcaus h had drawn up
th plan of campaign against Napolon and, having inducd Alxandr to
bliv in th fficacy of that plan, was dircting th whol businss
of th war. With Pful was Wolzogn, who xprssd Pful’s thoughts in
a mor comprhnsibl way than Pful himslf (who was a harsh, bookish
thorist, slf-confidnt to th point of dspising vryon ls) was
abl to do.
Bsids ths Russians and forignrs who propoundd nw and unxpctd
idas vry day—spcially th forignrs, who did so with a boldnss
charactristic of popl mployd in a country not thir own—thr wr
many scondary prsonags accompanying th army bcaus thir principals
wr thr.
Among th opinions and voics in this immns, rstlss, brilliant,
and proud sphr, Princ Andrw noticd th following sharply dfind
subdivisions of tndncis and partis:
Th first party consistd of Pful and his adhrnts—military thorists
who blivd in a scinc of war with immutabl laws—laws of obliqu
movmnts, outflankings, and so forth. Pful and his adhrnts dmandd
a rtirmnt into th dpths of th country in accordanc with prcis
laws dfind by a psudo-thory of war, and thy saw only barbarism,
ignoranc, or vil intntion in vry dviation from that thory. To
this party blongd th forign nobls, Wolzogn, Wintzingrod, and
othrs, chifly Grmans.
Th scond party was dirctly opposd to th first; on xtrm, as
always happns, was mt by rprsntativs of th othr. Th mmbrs of
this party wr thos who had dmandd an advanc from Vílna into Poland
and frdom from all prarrangd plans. Bsids bing advocats of bold
action, this sction also rprsntd nationalism, which mad thm still
mor on-sidd in th disput. Thy wr Russians: Bagratión, rmólov
(who was bginning to com to th front), and othrs. At that tim a
famous jok of rmólov’s was bing circulatd, that as a grat favor h
had ptitiond th mpror to mak him a Grman. Th mn of that party,
rmmbring Suvórov, said that what on had to do was not to rason,
or stick pins into maps, but to fight, bat th nmy, kp him out of
Russia, and not lt th army gt discouragd.
To th third party—in which th mpror had most confidnc—blongd th
courtirs who trid to arrang compromiss btwn th othr two. Th
mmbrs of this party, chifly civilians and to whom Arakchv blongd,
thought and said what mn who hav no convictions but wish to sm to
hav som gnrally say. Thy said that undoubtdly war, particularly
against such a gnius as Bonapart (thy calld him Bonapart now),
nds most dply dvisd plans and profound scintific knowldg and
in that rspct Pful was a gnius, but at th sam tim it had to b
acknowldgd that th thorists ar oftn on-sidd, and thrfor on
should not trust thm absolutly, but should also listn to what Pful’s
opponnts and practical mn of xprinc in warfar had to say, and
thn choos a middl cours. Thy insistd on th rtntion of th camp
at Drissa, according to Pful’s plan, but on changing th movmnts of
th othr armis. Though, by this cours, nithr on aim nor th othr
could b attaind, yt it smd bst to th adhrnts of this third
party.
Of a fourth opinion th most conspicuous rprsntativ was th
Tsarvich, who could not forgt his disillusionmnt at Austrlitz, whr
h had riddn out at th had of th Guards, in his casqu and cavalry
uniform as to a rviw, xpcting to crush th Frnch gallantly; but
unxpctdly finding himslf in th front lin had narrowly scapd amid
th gnral confusion. Th mn of this party had both th quality
and th dfct of franknss in thir opinions. Thy fard Napolon,
rcognizd his strngth and thir own waknss, and frankly said so.
Thy said: “Nothing but sorrow, sham, and ruin will com of all this!
W hav abandond Vílna and Vítbsk and shall abandon Drissa. Th only
rasonabl thing lft to do is to conclud pac as soon as possibl,
bfor w ar turnd out of Ptrsburg.”
This viw was vry gnral in th uppr army circls and found support
also in Ptrsburg and from th chancllor, Rumyántsv, who, for othr
rasons of stat, was in favor of pac.
Th fifth party consistd of thos who wr adhrnts of Barclay d
Tolly, not so much as a man but as ministr of war and commandr in
chif. “B h what h may” (thy always bgan lik that), “h is an
honst, practical man and w hav nobody bttr. Giv him ral powr,
for war cannot b conductd succssfully without unity of command, and
h will show what h can do, as h did in Finland. If our army is wll
organizd and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffring
any dfats, w ow this ntirly to Barclay. If Barclay is now to
b suprsdd by Bnnigsn all will b lost, for Bnnigsn showd his
incapacity alrady in 1807.”
Th sixth party, th Bnnigsnits, said, on th contrary, that at any
rat thr was no on mor activ and xprincd than Bnnigsn: “and
twist about as you may, you will hav to com to Bnnigsn vntually.
Lt th othrs mak mistaks now!” said thy, arguing that our
rtirmnt to Drissa was a most shamful rvrs and an unbrokn sris
of blundrs. “Th mor mistaks that ar mad th bttr. It will at any
rat b undrstood all th soonr that things cannot go on lik this.
What is wantd is not som Barclay or othr, but a man lik Bnnigsn,
who mad his mark in 1807, and to whom Napolon himslf did justic—a
man whos authority would b willingly rcognizd, and Bnnigsn is th
only such man.”
Th svnth party consistd of th sort of popl who ar always to
b found, spcially around young sovrigns, and of whom thr wr
particularly many round Alxandr—gnrals and imprial aids-d-camp
passionatly dvotd to th mpror, not mrly as a monarch but as a
man, adoring him sincrly and disintrstdly, as Rostóv had don
in 1805, and who saw in him not only all th virtus but all human
capabilitis as wll. Ths mn, though nchantd with th sovrign
for rfusing th command of th army, yt blamd him for such xcssiv
modsty, and only dsird and insistd that thir adord sovrign
should abandon his diffidnc and opnly announc that h would plac
himslf at th had of th army, gathr round him a commandr in chif’s
staff, and, consulting xprincd thorticians and practical mn whr
ncssary, would himslf lad th troops, whos spirits would thrby b
raisd to th highst pitch.
Th ighth and largst group, which in its normous numbrs was to th
othrs as ninty-nin to on, consistd of mn who dsird nithr
pac nor war, nithr an advanc nor a dfnsiv camp at th Drissa
or anywhr ls, nithr Barclay nor th mpror, nithr Pful nor
Bnnigsn, but only th on most ssntial thing—as much advantag
and plasur for thmslvs as possibl. In th troubld watrs of
conflicting and intrscting intrigus that ddid about th mpror’s
hadquartrs, it was possibl to succd in many ways unthinkabl at
othr tims. A man who simply wishd to rtain his lucrativ post would
today agr with Pful, tomorrow with his opponnt, and th day aftr,
mrly to avoid rsponsibility or to plas th mpror, would dclar
that h had no opinion at all on th mattr. Anothr who wishd to
gain som advantag would attract th mpror’s attntion by loudly
advocating th vry thing th mpror had hintd at th day bfor,
and would disput and shout at th council, bating his brast and
challnging thos who did not agr with him to duls, thrby proving
that h was prpard to sacrific himslf for th common good. A third,
in th absnc of opponnts, btwn two councils would simply solicit
a spcial gratuity for his faithful srvics, wll knowing that at that
momnt popl would b too busy to rfus him. A fourth whil smingly
ovrwhlmd with work would oftn com accidntally undr th mpror’s
y. A fifth, to achiv his long-chrishd aim of dining with th
mpror, would stubbornly insist on th corrctnss or falsity of som
nwly mrging opinion and for this objct would produc argumnts mor
or lss forcibl and corrct.
All th mn of this party wr fishing for rubls, dcorations, and
promotions, and in this pursuit watchd only th wathrcock of imprial
favor, and dirctly thy noticd it turning in any dirction, this whol
dron population of th army bgan blowing hard that way, so that it
was all th hardr for th mpror to turn it lswhr. Amid th
uncrtaintis of th position, with th mnac of srious dangr giving
a pculiarly thratning charactr to vrything, amid this vortx of
intrigu, gotism, conflict of viws and flings, and th divrsity
of rac among ths popl—this ighth and largst party of thos
proccupid with prsonal intrsts impartd grat confusion and
obscurity to th common task. Whatvr qustion aros, a swarm of ths
drons, without having finishd thir buzzing on a prvious thm, flw
ovr to th nw on and by thir hum drownd and obscurd th voics of
thos who wr disputing honstly.
From among all ths partis, just at th tim Princ Andrw rachd
th army, anothr, a ninth party, was bing formd and was bginning
to rais its voic. This was th party of th ldrs, rasonabl mn
xprincd and capabl in stat affairs, who, without sharing any of
thos conflicting opinions, wr abl to tak a dtachd viw of what
was going on at th staff at hadquartrs and to considr mans of
scap from this muddl, indcision, intricacy, and waknss.
Th mn of this party said and thought that what was wrong rsultd
chifly from th mpror’s prsnc in th army with his military court
and from th consqunt prsnc thr of an indfinit, conditional,
and unstady fluctuation of rlations, which is in plac at court but
harmful in an army; that a sovrign should rign but not command th
army, and that th only way out of th position would b for th mpror
and his court to lav th army; that th mr prsnc of th mpror
paralyzd th action of fifty thousand mn rquird to scur his
prsonal safty, and that th worst commandr in chif, if indpndnt,
would b bttr than th vry bst on trammld by th prsnc and
authority of th monarch.
Just at th tim Princ Andrw was living unoccupid at Drissa,
Shishkóv, th Scrtary of Stat and on of th chif rprsntativs of
this party, wrot a lttr to th mpror which Arakchv and Balashëv
agrd to sign. In this lttr, availing himslf of prmission givn him
by th mpror to discuss th gnral cours of affairs, h rspctfully
suggstd—on th pla that it was ncssary for th sovrign to arous
a warlik spirit in th popl of th capital—that th mpror should
lav th army.
That arousing of th popl by thir sovrign and his call to thm to
dfnd thir country—th vry incitmnt which was th chif caus of
Russia’s triumph in so far as it was producd by th Tsar’s prsonal
prsnc in Moscow—was suggstd to th mpror, and accptd by him, as
a prtxt for quitting th army.
CHAPTR X
This lttr had not yt bn prsntd to th mpror whn Barclay, on
day at dinnr, informd Bolkónski that th sovrign wishd to s him
prsonally, to qustion him about Turky, and that Princ Andrw was to
prsnt himslf at Bnnigsn’s quartrs at six that vning.
Nws was rcivd at th mpror’s quartrs that vry day of a frsh
movmnt by Napolon which might ndangr th army—nws subsquntly
found to b fals. And that morning Colonl Michaud had riddn round th
Drissa fortifications with th mpror and had pointd out to him that
this fortifid camp constructd by Pful, and till thn considrd
a chf-d’ouvr of tactical scinc which would nsur Napolon’s
dstruction, was an absurdity, thratning th dstruction of th
Russian army.
Princ Andrw arrivd at Bnnigsn’s quartrs—a country gntlman’s
hous of modrat siz, situatd on th vry banks of th rivr. Nithr
Bnnigsn nor th mpror was thr, but Chrnýshv, th mpror’s
aid-d-camp, rcivd Bolkónski and informd him that th mpror,
accompanid by Gnral Bnnigsn and Marquis Paulucci, had gon a scond
tim that day to inspct th fortifications of th Drissa camp, of th
suitability of which srious doubts wr bginning to b flt.
Chrnýshv was sitting at a window in th first room with a Frnch novl
in his hand. This room had probably bn a music room; thr was still
an organ in it on which som rugs wr pild, and in on cornr stood
th folding bdstad of Bnnigsn’s adjutant. This adjutant was also
thr and sat dozing on th rolld-up bdding, vidntly xhaustd by
work or by fasting. Two doors ld from th room, on straight on into
what had bn th drawing room, and anothr, on th right, to th study.
Through th first door cam th sound of voics convrsing in Grman
and occasionally in Frnch. In that drawing room wr gathrd, by
th mpror’s wish, not a military council (th mpror prfrrd
indfinitnss), but crtain prsons whos opinions h wishd to know in
viw of th impnding difficultis. It was not a council of war, but,
as it wr, a council to lucidat crtain qustions for th mpror
prsonally. To this smicouncil had bn invitd th Swdish Gnral
Armfldt, Adjutant Gnral Wolzogn, Wintzingrod (whom Napolon had
rfrrd to as a rngad Frnch subjct), Michaud, Toll, Count Stin
who was not a military man at all, and Pful himslf, who, as Princ
Andrw had hard, was th mainspring of th whol affair. Princ Andrw
had an opportunity of gtting a good look at him, for Pful arrivd soon
aftr himslf and, in passing through to th drawing room, stoppd a
minut to spak to Chrnýshv.
At first sight, Pful, in his ill-mad uniform of a Russian gnral,
which fittd him badly lik a fancy costum, smd familiar to Princ
Andrw, though h saw him now for th first tim. Thr was about
him somthing of Wyrothr, Mack, and Schmidt, and many othr Grman
thorist-gnrals whom Princ Andrw had sn in 1805, but h was mor
typical than any of thm. Princ Andrw had nvr yt sn a Grman
thorist in whom all th charactristics of thos othrs wr unitd to
such an xtnt.
Pful was short and vry thin but broad-bond, of coars, robust build,
broad in th hips, and with prominnt shouldr blads. His fac was
much wrinkld and his ys dp st. His hair had vidntly bn hastily
brushd smooth in front of th tmpls, but stuck up bhind in quaint
littl tufts. H ntrd th room, looking rstlssly and angrily
around, as if afraid of vrything in that larg apartmnt. Awkwardly
holding up his sword, h addrssd Chrnýshv and askd in Grman whr
th mpror was. On could s that h wishd to pass through th rooms
as quickly as possibl, finish with th bows and grtings, and sit down
to businss in front of a map, whr h would fl at hom. H noddd
hurridly in rply to Chrnýshv, and smild ironically on haring that
th sovrign was inspcting th fortifications that h, Pful, had
plannd in accord with his thory. H muttrd somthing to himslf
abruptly and in a bass voic, as slf-assurd Grmans do—it might
hav bn “stupid fllow”... or “th whol affair will b ruind,” or
“somthing absurd will com of it.”... Princ Andrw did not catch
what h said and would hav passd on, but Chrnýshv introducd him to
Pful, rmarking that Princ Andrw was just back from Turky whr th
war had trminatd so fortunatly. Pful barly glancd—not so much at
Princ Andrw as past him—and said, with a laugh: “That must hav bn a
fin tactical war”; and, laughing contmptuously, wnt on into th room
from which th sound of voics was hard.
Pful, always inclind to b irritably sarcastic, was particularly
disturbd that day, vidntly by th fact that thy had dard to inspct
and criticiz his camp in his absnc. From this short intrviw with
Pful, Princ Andrw, thanks to his Austrlitz xprincs, was abl to
form a clar concption of th man. Pful was on of thos hoplssly
and immutably slf-confidnt mn, slf-confidnt to th point of
martyrdom as only Grmans ar, bcaus only Grmans ar slf-confidnt
on th basis of an abstract notion—scinc, that is, th supposd
knowldg of absolut truth. A Frnchman is slf-assurd bcaus h
rgards himslf prsonally, both in mind and body, as irrsistibly
attractiv to mn and womn. An nglishman is slf-assurd, as bing a
citizn of th bst-organizd stat in th world, and thrfor as an
nglishman always knows what h should do and knows that all h dos as
an nglishman is undoubtdly corrct. An Italian is slf-assurd bcaus
h is xcitabl and asily forgts himslf and othr popl. A Russian
is slf-assurd just bcaus h knows nothing and dos not want to know
anything, sinc h dos not bliv that anything can b known. Th
Grman’s slf-assuranc is worst of all, strongr and mor
rpulsiv than any othr, bcaus h imagins that h knows th
truth—scinc—which h himslf has invntd but which is for him th
absolut truth.
Pful was vidntly of that sort. H had a scinc—th thory of obliqu
movmnts dducd by him from th history of Frdrick th Grat’s wars,
and all h cam across in th history of mor rcnt warfar smd to
him absurd and barbarous—monstrous collisions in which so many blundrs
wr committd by both sids that ths wars could not b calld wars,
thy did not accord with th thory, and thrfor could not srv as
matrial for scinc.
In 1806 Pful had bn on of thos rsponsibl, for th plan of
campaign that ndd in Jna and Aurstädt, but h did not s th last
proof of th fallibility of his thory in th disastrs of that war. On
th contrary, th dviations mad from his thory wr, in his opinion,
th sol caus of th whol disastr, and with charactristically
glful sarcasm h would rmark, “Thr, I said th whol affair would
go to th dvil!” Pful was on of thos thorticians who so lov
thir thory that thy los sight of th thory’s objct—its practical
application. His lov of thory mad him hat vrything practical, and
h would not listn to it. H was vn plasd by failurs, for failurs
rsulting from dviations in practic from th thory only provd to him
th accuracy of his thory.
H said a fw words to Princ Andrw and Chrnýshv about th prsnt
war, with th air of a man who knows bforhand that all will go wrong,
and who is not displasd that it should b so. Th unbrushd tufts
of hair sticking up bhind and th hastily brushd hair on his tmpls
xprssd this most loquntly.
H passd into th nxt room, and th dp, qurulous sounds of his
voic wr at onc hard from thr.
CHAPTR XI
Princ Andrw’s ys wr still following Pful out of th room whn
Count Bnnigsn ntrd hurridly, and nodding to Bolkónski, but not
pausing, wnt into th study, giving instructions to his adjutant as h
wnt. Th mpror was following him, and Bnnigsn had hastnd on
to mak som prparations and to b rady to rciv th sovrign.
Chrnýshv and Princ Andrw wnt out into th porch, whr th mpror,
who lookd fatigud, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to
him with particular warmth and th mpror, with his had bnt to th
lft, was listning with a dissatisfid air. Th mpror movd forward
vidntly wishing to nd th convrsation, but th flushd and xcitd
Italian, oblivious of dcorum, followd him and continud to spak.
“And as for th man who advisd forming this camp—th Drissa camp,” said
Paulucci, as th mpror mountd th stps and noticing Princ Andrw
scannd his unfamiliar fac, “as to that prson, sir...” continud
Paulucci, dspratly, apparntly unabl to rstrain himslf, “th man
who advisd th Drissa camp—I s no altrnativ but th lunatic asylum
or th gallows!”
Without hding th nd of th Italian’s rmarks, and as though
not haring thm, th mpror, rcognizing Bolkónski, addrssd him
graciously.
“I am vry glad to s you! Go in thr whr thy ar mting, and wait
for m.”
Th mpror wnt into th study. H was followd by Princ Ptr
Mikháylovich Volkónski and Baron Stin, and th door closd bhind thm.
Princ Andrw, taking advantag of th mpror’s prmission, accompanid
Paulucci, whom h had known in Turky, into th drawing room whr th
council was assmbld.
Princ Ptr Mikháylovich Volkónski occupid th position, as it wr,
of chif of th mpror’s staff. H cam out of th study into th
drawing room with som maps which h sprad on a tabl, and put
qustions on which h wishd to har th opinion of th gntlmn
prsnt. What had happnd was that nws (which aftrwards provd to b
fals) had bn rcivd during th night of a movmnt by th Frnch to
outflank th Drissa camp.
Th first to spak was Gnral Armfldt who, to mt th difficulty that
prsntd itslf, unxpctdly proposd a prfctly nw position
away from th Ptrsburg and Moscow roads. Th rason for this was
inxplicabl (unlss h wishd to show that h, too, could hav an
opinion), but h urgd that at this point th army should unit and
thr await th nmy. It was plain that Armfldt had thought out that
plan long ago and now xpoundd it not so much to answr th qustions
put—which, in fact, his plan did not answr—as to avail himslf of th
opportunity to air it. It was on of th millions of proposals, on as
good as anothr, that could b mad as long as it was quit unknown
what charactr th war would tak. Som disputd his argumnts, othrs
dfndd thm. Young Count Toll objctd to th Swdish gnral’s viws
mor warmly than anyon ls, and in th cours of th disput drw from
his sid pockt a wll-filld notbook, which h askd prmission to
rad to thm. In ths voluminous nots Toll suggstd anothr schm,
totally diffrnt from Armfldt’s or Pful’s plan of campaign. In answr
to Toll, Paulucci suggstd an advanc and an attack, which, h urgd,
could alon xtricat us from th prsnt uncrtainty and from th trap
(as h calld th Drissa camp) in which w wr situatd.
During all ths discussions Pful and his intrprtr, Wolzogn
(his “bridg” in court rlations), wr silnt. Pful only snortd
contmptuously and turnd away, to show that h would nvr dman
himslf by rplying to such nonsns as h was now haring. So whn
Princ Volkónski, who was in th chair, calld on him to giv his
opinion, h mrly said:
“Why ask m? Gnral Armfldt has proposd a splndid position with an
xposd rar, or why not this Italian gntlman’s attack—vry fin, or
a rtrat, also good! Why ask m?” said h. “Why, you yourslvs know
vrything bttr than I do.”
But whn Volkónski said, with a frown, that it was in th mpror’s nam
that h askd his opinion, Pful ros and, suddnly growing animatd,
bgan to spak:
“vrything has bn spoild, vrything muddld, vrybody thought thy
knw bttr than I did, and now you com to m! How mnd mattrs? Thr
is nothing to mnd! Th principls laid down by m must b strictly
adhrd to,” said h, drumming on th tabl with his bony fingrs. “What
is th difficulty? Nonsns, childishnss!”
H wnt up to th map and spaking rapidly bgan proving that no
vntuality could altr th fficincy of th Drissa camp, that
vrything had bn forsn, and that if th nmy wr rally going to
outflank it, th nmy would invitably b dstroyd.
Paulucci, who did not know Grman, bgan qustioning him in Frnch.
Wolzogn cam to th assistanc of his chif, who spok Frnch badly,
and bgan translating for him, hardly abl to kp pac with Pful, who
was rapidly dmonstrating that not only all that had happnd, but all
that could happn, had bn forsn in his schm, and that if thr
wr now any difficultis th whol fault lay in th fact that his plan
had not bn prcisly xcutd. H kpt laughing sarcastically, h
dmonstratd, and at last contmptuously casd to dmonstrat, lik
a mathmatician who cass to prov in various ways th accuracy of
a problm that has alrady bn provd. Wolzogn took his plac and
continud to xplain his viws in Frnch, vry now and thn turning to
Pful and saying, “Is it not so, your xcllncy?” But Pful, lik a man
hatd in a fight who striks thos on his own sid, shoutd angrily at
his own supportr, Wolzogn:
“Wll, of cours, what mor is thr to xplain?”
Paulucci and Michaud both attackd Wolzogn simultanously in Frnch.
Armfldt addrssd Pful in Grman. Toll xplaind to Volkónski in
Russian. Princ Andrw listnd and obsrvd in silnc.
Of all ths mn Princ Andrw sympathizd most with Pful, angry,
dtrmind, and absurdly slf-confidnt as h was. Of all thos prsnt,
vidntly h alon was not sking anything for himslf, nursd no
hatrd against anyon, and only dsird that th plan, formd on a
thory arrivd at by yars of toil, should b carrid out. H was
ridiculous, and unplasantly sarcastic, but yt h inspird involuntary
rspct by his boundlss dvotion to an ida. Bsids this, th rmarks
of all xcpt Pful had on common trait that had not bn noticabl
at th council of war in 1805: thr was now a panic far of Napolon’s
gnius, which, though concald, was noticabl in vry rjoindr.
vrything was assumd to b possibl for Napolon, thy xpctd him
from vry sid, and invokd his trribl nam to shattr ach othr’s
proposals. Pful alon smd to considr Napolon a barbarian lik
vryon ls who opposd his thory. But bsids this fling of
rspct, Pful vokd pity in Princ Andrw. From th ton in which
th courtirs addrssd him and th way Paulucci had allowd himslf to
spak of him to th mpror, but abov all from a crtain dspration
in Pful’s own xprssions, it was clar that th othrs knw, and Pful
himslf flt, that his fall was at hand. And dspit his slf-confidnc
and grumpy Grman sarcasm h was pitiabl, with his hair smoothly
brushd on th tmpls and sticking up in tufts bhind. Though h
concald th fact undr a show of irritation and contmpt, h was
vidntly in dspair that th sol rmaining chanc of vrifying his
thory by a hug xprimnt and proving its soundnss to th whol world
was slipping away from him.
Th discussions continud a long tim, and th longr thy lastd
th mor hatd bcam th disputs, culminating in shouts and
prsonalitis, and th lss was it possibl to arriv at any gnral
conclusion from all that had bn said. Princ Andrw, listning to this
polyglot talk and to ths surmiss, plans, rfutations, and shouts,
flt nothing but amazmnt at what thy wr saying. A thought that had
long sinc and oftn occurrd to him during his military activitis—th
ida that thr is not and cannot b any scinc of war, and that
thrfor thr can b no such thing as a military gnius—now appard
to him an obvious truth. “What thory and scinc is possibl about a
mattr th conditions and circumstancs of which ar unknown and cannot
b dfind, spcially whn th strngth of th acting forcs cannot b
ascrtaind? No on was or is abl to fors in what condition our or
th nmy’s armis will b in a day’s tim, and no on can gaug th
forc of this or that dtachmnt. Somtims—whn thr is not a coward
at th front to shout, ‘W ar cut off!’ and start running, but a brav
and jolly lad who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’—a dtachmnt of fiv thousand
is worth thirty thousand, as at Schön Grabrn, whil at tims fifty
thousand run from ight thousand, as at Austrlitz. What scinc can
thr b in a mattr in which, as in all practical mattrs, nothing
can b dfind and vrything dpnds on innumrabl conditions, th
significanc of which is dtrmind at a particular momnt which arrivs
no on knows whn? Armfldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci
says w hav got th Frnch army btwn two firs; Michaud says that
th worthlssnss of th Drissa camp lis in having th rivr bhind it,
and Pful says that is what constituts its strngth; Toll proposs
on plan, Armfldt anothr, and thy ar all good and all bad, and th
advantags of any suggstions can b sn only at th momnt of trial.
And why do thy all spak of a ‘military gnius’? Is a man a gnius who
can ordr brad to b brought up at th right tim and say who is to go
to th right and who to th lft? It is only bcaus military mn ar
invstd with pomp and powr and crowds of sychophants flattr powr,
attributing to it qualitis of gnius it dos not possss. Th bst
gnrals I hav known wr, on th contrary, stupid or absnt-mindd
mn. Bagratión was th bst, Napolon himslf admittd that. And of
Bonapart himslf! I rmmbr his limitd, slf-satisfid fac on th
fild of Austrlitz. Not only dos a good army commandr not nd any
spcial qualitis, on th contrary h nds th absnc of th highst
and bst human attributs—lov, potry, tndrnss, and philosophic
inquiring doubt. H should b limitd, firmly convincd that what h
is doing is vry important (othrwis h will not hav sufficint
patinc), and only thn will h b a brav ladr. God forbid that h
should b human, should lov, or pity, or think of what is just
and unjust. It is undrstandabl that a thory of thir ‘gnius’ was
invntd for thm long ago bcaus thy hav powr! Th succss of a
military action dpnds not on thm, but on th man in th ranks who
shouts, ‘W ar lost!’ or who shouts, ‘Hurrah!’ And only in th ranks
can on srv with assuranc of bing usful.”
So thought Princ Andrw as h listnd to th talking, and h rousd
himslf only whn Paulucci calld him and vryon was laving.
At th rviw nxt day th mpror askd Princ Andrw whr h would
lik to srv, and Princ Andrw lost his standing in court circls
forvr by not asking to rmain attachd to th sovrign’s prson, but
for prmission to srv in th army.
CHAPTR XII
Bfor th bginning of th campaign, Rostóv had rcivd a lttr from
his parnts in which thy told him brifly of Natásha’s illnss and th
braking off of hr ngagmnt to Princ Andrw (which thy xplaind by
Natásha’s having rjctd him) and again askd Nicholas to rtir from
th army and rturn hom. On rciving this lttr, Nicholas did not
vn mak any attmpt to gt lav of absnc or to rtir from th
army, but wrot to his parnts that h was sorry Natásha was ill and hr
ngagmnt brokn off, and that h would do all h could to mt thir
wishs. To Sónya h wrot sparatly.
“Adord frind of my soul!” h wrot. “Nothing but honor could kp
m from rturning to th country. But now, at th commncmnt of th
campaign, I should fl dishonord, not only in my comrads’ ys but
in my own, if I prfrrd my own happinss to my lov and duty to th
Fathrland. But this shall b our last sparation. Bliv m, dirctly
th war is ovr, if I am still aliv and still lovd by you, I will
throw up vrything and fly to you, to prss you forvr to my ardnt
brast.”
It was, in fact, only th commncmnt of th campaign that prvntd
Rostóv from rturning hom as h had promisd and marrying Sónya. Th
autumn in Otrádno with th hunting, and th wintr with th Christmas
holidays and Sónya’s lov, had opnd out to him a vista of tranquil
rural joys and pac such as h had nvr known bfor, and which now
allurd him. “A splndid wif, childrn, a good pack of hounds, a
dozn lashs of smart borzois, agricultur, nighbors, srvic by
lction...” thought h. But now th campaign was bginning, and h had
to rmain with his rgimnt. And sinc it had to b so, Nicholas Rostóv,
as was natural to him, flt contntd with th lif h ld in th
rgimnt and was abl to find plasur in that lif.
On his rturn from his furlough Nicholas, having bn joyfully wlcomd
by his comrads, was snt to obtain rmounts and brought back from th
Ukrain xcllnt horss which plasd him and arnd him commndation
from his commandrs. During his absnc h had bn promotd captain,
and whn th rgimnt was put on war footing with an incras in
numbrs, h was again allottd his old squadron.
Th campaign bgan, th rgimnt was movd into Poland on doubl pay,
nw officrs arrivd, nw mn and horss, and abov all vrybody was
infctd with th mrrily xcitd mood that gos with th commncmnt
of a war, and Rostóv, conscious of his advantagous position in th
rgimnt, dvotd himslf ntirly to th plasurs and intrsts of
military srvic, though h knw that soonr or latr h would hav to
rlinquish thm.
Th troops rtird from Vílna for various complicatd rasons of stat,
political and stratgic. ach stp of th rtrat was accompanid by
a complicatd intrplay of intrsts, argumnts, and passions at
hadquartrs. For th Pávlograd hussars, howvr, th whol of this
rtrat during th finst priod of summr and with sufficint supplis
was a vry simpl and agrabl businss.
It was only at hadquartrs that thr was dprssion, unasinss, and
intriguing; in th body of th army thy did not ask thmslvs whr
thy wr going or why. If thy rgrttd having to rtrat, it was only
bcaus thy had to lav billts thy had grown accustomd to, or som
prtty young Polish lady. If th thought that things lookd bad chancd
to ntr anyon’s had, h trid to b as chrful as bfits a good
soldir and not to think of th gnral trnd of affairs, but only of
th task narst to hand. First thy campd gaily bfor Vílna, making
acquaintanc with th Polish landownrs, prparing for rviws and bing
rviwd by th mpror and othr high commandrs. Thn cam an ordr
to rtrat to Svntsyáni and dstroy any provisions thy could not carry
away with thm. Svntsyáni was rmmbrd by th hussars only as th
drunkn camp, a nam th whol army gav to thir ncampmnt thr,
and bcaus many complaints wr mad against th troops, who, taking
advantag of th ordr to collct provisions, took also horss,
carriags, and carpts from th Polish propritors. Rostóv rmmbrd
Svntsyáni, bcaus on th first day of thir arrival at that small town
h changd his srgant major and was unabl to manag all th drunkn
mn of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriatd fiv barrls
of old br. From Svntsyáni thy rtird farthr and farthr to Drissa,
and thnc again byond Drissa, drawing nar to th frontir of Russia
propr.
On th thirtnth of July th Pávlograds took part in a srious action
for th first tim.
On th twlfth of July, on th v of that action, thr was a havy
storm of rain and hail. In gnral, th summr of 1812 was rmarkabl
for its storms.
Th two Pávlograd squadrons wr bivouacking on a fild of ry, which
was alrady in ar but had bn compltly troddn down by cattl and
horss. Th rain was dscnding in torrnts, and Rostóv, with a young
officr namd Ilyín, his protg, was sitting in a hastily constructd
shltr. An officr of thir rgimnt, with long mustachs xtnding
onto his chks, who aftr riding to th staff had bn ovrtakn by th
rain, ntrd Rostóv’s shltr.
“I hav com from th staff, Count. Hav you hard of Ravski’s
xploit?”
And th officr gav thm dtails of th Saltánov battl, which h had
hard at th staff.
Rostóv, smoking his pip and turning his had about as th watr
trickld down his nck, listnd inattntivly, with an occasional
glanc at Ilyín, who was prssing clos to him. This officr, a lad
of sixtn who had rcntly joind th rgimnt, was now in th sam
rlation to Nicholas that Nicholas had bn to Dnísov svn yars
bfor. Ilyín trid to imitat Rostóv in vrything and adord him as a
girl might hav don.
Zdrzhinski, th officr with th long mustach, spok grandiloquntly of
th Saltánov dam bing “a Russian Thrmopyla,” and of how a dd worthy
of antiquity had bn prformd by Gnral Ravski. H rcountd how
Ravski had ld his two sons onto th dam undr trrific fir and had
chargd with thm bsid him. Rostóv hard th story and not only said
nothing to ncourag Zdrzhinski’s nthusiasm but, on th contrary,
lookd lik a man ashamd of what h was haring, though with no
intntion of contradicting it. Sinc th campaigns of Austrlitz and
of 1807 Rostóv knw by xprinc that mn always li whn dscribing
military xploits, as h himslf had don whn rcounting thm; bsids
that, h had xprinc nough to know that nothing happns in war at
all as w can imagin or rlat it. And so h did not lik Zdrzhinski’s
tal, nor did h lik Zdrzhinski himslf who, with his mustachs
xtnding ovr his chks, bnt low ovr th fac of his harr, as was
his habit, and crowdd Rostóv in th narrow shanty. Rostóv lookd at him
in silnc. “In th first plac, thr must hav bn such a confusion
and crowding on th dam that was bing attackd that if Ravski did lad
his sons thr, it could hav had no ffct xcpt prhaps on som dozn
mn narst to him,” thought h, “th rst could not hav sn how or
with whom Ravski cam onto th dam. And vn thos who did s it
would not hav bn much stimulatd by it, for what had thy to do with
Ravski’s tndr patrnal flings whn thir own skins wr in dangr?
And bsids, th fat of th Fathrland did not dpnd on whthr
thy took th Saltánov dam or not, as w ar told was th cas at
Thrmopyla. So why should h hav mad such a sacrific? And why xpos
his own childrn in th battl? I would not hav takn my brothr Ptya
thr, or vn Ilyín, who’s a strangr to m but a nic lad, but would
hav trid to put thm somwhr undr covr,” Nicholas continud
to think, as h listnd to Zdrzhinski. But h did not xprss his
thoughts, for in such mattrs, too, h had gaind xprinc. H knw
that this tal rdoundd to th glory of our arms and so on had to
prtnd not to doubt it. And h actd accordingly.
“I can’t stand this any mor,” said Ilyín, noticing that Rostóv did not
rlish Zdrzhinski’s convrsation. “My stockings and shirt... and th
watr is running on my sat! I’ll go and look for shltr. Th rain
sms lss havy.”
Ilyín wnt out and Zdrzhinski rod away.
Fiv minuts latr Ilyín, splashing through th mud, cam running back
to th shanty.
“Hurrah! Rostóv, com quick! I’v found it! About two hundrd yards away
thr’s a tavrn whr ours hav alrady gathrd. W can at last gt
dry thr, and Mary Hndríkhovna’s thr.”
Mary Hndríkhovna was th wif of th rgimntal doctor, a prtty young
Grman woman h had marrid in Poland. Th doctor, whthr from lack
of mans or bcaus h did not lik to part from his young wif in
th arly days of thir marriag, took hr about with him whrvr th
hussar rgimnt wnt and his jalousy had bcom a standing jok among
th hussar officrs.
Rostóv thrw his cloak ovr his shouldrs, shoutd to Lavrúshka to
follow with th things, and—now slipping in th mud, now splashing right
through it—st off with Ilyín in th lssning rain and th darknss
that was occasionally rnt by distant lightning.
“Rostóv, whr ar you?”
“Hr. What lightning!” thy calld to on anothr.
CHAPTR XIII
In th tavrn, bfor which stood th doctor’s covrd cart, thr wr
alrady som fiv officrs. Mary Hndríkhovna, a plump littl blond
Grman, in a drssing jackt and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bnch
in th front cornr. Hr husband, th doctor, lay aslp bhind hr.
Rostóv and Ilyín, on ntring th room, wr wlcomd with mrry shouts
and laughtr.
“Dar m, how jolly w ar!” said Rostóv laughing.
“And why do you stand thr gaping?”
“What swlls thy ar! Why, th watr strams from thm! Don’t mak our
drawing room so wt.”
“Don’t mss Mary Hndríkhovna’s drss!” crid othr voics.
Rostóv and Ilyín hastnd to find a cornr whr thy could chang into
dry cloths without offnding Mary Hndríkhovna’s modsty. Thy wr
going into a tiny rcss bhind a partition to chang, but found it
compltly filld by thr officrs who sat playing cards by th light
of a solitary candl on an mpty box, and ths officrs would on no
account yild thir position. Mary Hndríkhovna obligd thm with th
loan of a ptticoat to b usd as a curtain, and bhind that scrn
Rostóv and Ilyín, hlpd by Lavrúshka who had brought thir kits,
changd thir wt things for dry ons.
A fir was mad up in th dilapidatd brick stov. A board was found,
fixd on two saddls and covrd with a horscloth, a small samovar was
producd and a cllart and half a bottl of rum, and having askd Mary
Hndríkhovna to prsid, thy all crowdd round hr. On offrd hr a
clan handkrchif to wip hr charming hands, anothr sprad a jackt
undr hr littl ft to kp thm from th damp, anothr hung his coat
ovr th window to kp out th draft, and yt anothr wavd th flis
off hr husband’s fac, lst h should wak up.
“Lav him alon,” said Mary Hndríkhovna, smiling timidly and happily.
“H is slping wll as it is, aftr a slplss night.”
“Oh, no, Mary Hndríkhovna,” rplid th officr, “on must look aftr
th doctor. Prhaps h’ll tak pity on m somday, whn it coms to
cutting off a lg or an arm for m.”
Thr wr only thr tumblrs, th watr was so muddy that on could
not mak out whthr th ta was strong or wak, and th samovar hld
only six tumblrs of watr, but this mad it all th plasantr to
tak turns in ordr of sniority to rciv on’s tumblr from Mary
Hndríkhovna’s plump littl hands with thir short and not ovrclan
nails. All th officrs appard to b, and rally wr, in lov with
hr that vning. vn thos playing cards bhind th partition soon
lft thir gam and cam ovr to th samovar, yilding to th gnral
mood of courting Mary Hndríkhovna. Sh, sing hrslf surroundd by
such brilliant and polit young mn, bamd with satisfaction, try as
sh might to hid it, and prturbd as sh vidntly was ach tim hr
husband movd in his slp bhind hr.
Thr was only on spoon, sugar was mor plntiful than anything
ls, but it took too long to dissolv, so it was dcidd that Mary
Hndríkhovna should stir th sugar for vryon in turn. Rostóv rcivd
his tumblr, and adding som rum to it askd Mary Hndríkhovna to stir
it.
“But you tak it without sugar?” sh said, smiling all th tim, as if
vrything sh said and vrything th othrs said was vry amusing and
had a doubl maning.
“It is not th sugar I want, but only that your littl hand should stir
my ta.”
Mary Hndríkhovna assntd and bgan looking for th spoon which somon
manwhil had pouncd on.
“Us your fingr, Mary Hndríkhovna, it will b still nicr,” said
Rostóv.
“Too hot!” sh rplid, blushing with plasur.
Ilyín put a fw drops of rum into th buckt of watr and brought it to
Mary Hndríkhovna, asking hr to stir it with hr fingr.
“This is my cup,” said h. “Only dip your fingr in it and I’ll drink it
all up.”
Whn thy had mptid th samovar, Rostóv took a pack of cards and
proposd that thy should play “Kings” with Mary Hndríkhovna. Thy drw
lots to sttl who should mak up hr st. At Rostóv’s suggstion it
was agrd that whovr bcam “King” should hav th right to kiss Mary
Hndríkhovna’s hand, and that th “Booby” should go to rfill and rhat
th samovar for th doctor whn th lattr awok.
“Wll, but supposing Mary Hndríkhovna is ‘King’?” askd Ilyín.
“As it is, sh is Qun, and hr word is law!”
Thy had hardly bgun to play bfor th doctor’s dishvld had
suddnly appard from bhind Mary Hndríkhovna. H had bn awak for
som tim, listning to what was bing said, and vidntly found nothing
ntrtaining or amusing in what was going on. His fac was sad and
dprssd. Without grting th officrs, h scratchd himslf and askd
to b allowd to pass as thy wr blocking th way. As soon as h
had lft th room all th officrs burst into loud laughtr and Mary
Hndríkhovna blushd till hr ys filld with tars and thrby bcam
still mor attractiv to thm. Rturning from th yard, th doctor
told his wif (who had casd to smil so happily, and lookd at him in
alarm, awaiting hr sntnc) that th rain had casd and thy must go
to slp in thir covrd cart, or vrything in it would b stoln.
“But I’ll snd an ordrly.... Two of thm!” said Rostóv. “What an ida,
doctor!”
“I’ll stand guard on it myslf!” said Ilyín.
“No, gntlmn, you hav had your slp, but I hav not slpt for two
nights,” rplid th doctor, and h sat down morosly bsid his wif,
waiting for th gam to nd.
Sing his gloomy fac as h frownd at his wif, th officrs grw
still mrrir, and som of thm could not rfrain from laughtr, for
which thy hurridly sought plausibl prtxts. Whn h had gon, taking
his wif with him, and had sttld down with hr in thir covrd cart,
th officrs lay down in th tavrn, covring thmslvs with thir
wt cloaks, but thy did not slp for a long tim; now thy xchangd
rmarks, rcalling th doctor’s unasinss and his wif’s dlight, now
thy ran out into th porch and rportd what was taking plac in th
covrd trap. Svral tims Rostóv, covring his had, trid to go
to slp, but som rmark would arous him and convrsation would b
rsumd, to th accompanimnt of unrasoning, mrry, childlik laughtr.
CHAPTR XIV
It was narly thr o’clock but no on was yt aslp, whn th
quartrmastr appard with an ordr to mov on to th littl town
of Ostróvna. Still laughing and talking, th officrs bgan hurridly
gtting rady and again boild som muddy watr in th samovar. But
Rostóv wnt off to his squadron without waiting for ta. Day was
braking, th rain had casd, and th clouds wr disprsing. It flt
damp and cold, spcially in cloths that wr still moist. As thy lft
th tavrn in th twilight of th dawn, Rostóv and Ilyín both glancd
undr th wt and glistning lathr hood of th doctor’s cart, from
undr th apron of which his ft wr sticking out, and in th middl
of which his wif’s nightcap was visibl and hr slpy brathing
audibl.
“Sh rally is a dar littl thing,” said Rostóv to Ilyín, who was
following him.
“A charming woman!” said Ilyín, with all th gravity of a boy of
sixtn.
Half an hour latr th squadron was lind up on th road. Th command
was hard to “mount” and th soldirs crossd thmslvs and mountd.
Rostóv riding in front gav th ordr “Forward!” and th hussars, with
clanking sabrs and subdud talk, thir horss’ hoofs splashing in th
mud, dfild in fours and movd along th broad road plantd with birch
trs on ach sid, following th infantry and a battry that had gon
on in front.
Tattrd, blu-purpl clouds, rddning in th ast, wr scudding
bfor th wind. It was growing lightr and lightr. That curly grass
which always grows by country roadsids bcam clarly visibl, still
wt with th night’s rain; th drooping branchs of th birchs, also
wt, swayd in th wind and flung down bright drops of watr to on
sid. Th soldirs’ facs wr mor and mor clarly visibl. Rostóv,
always closly followd by Ilyín, rod along th sid of th road
btwn two rows of birch trs.
Whn campaigning, Rostóv allowd himslf th indulgnc of riding not
a rgimntal but a Cossack hors. A judg of horss and a sportsman,
h had latly procurd himslf a larg, fin, mttlsom, Donts hors,
dun-colord, with light man and tail, and whn h rod it no on could
outgallop him. To rid this hors was a plasur to him, and h thought
of th hors, of th morning, of th doctor’s wif, but not onc of th
impnding dangr.
Formrly, whn going into action, Rostóv had flt afraid; now h had
not th last fling of far. H was farlss, not bcaus h had grown
usd to bing undr fir (on cannot grow usd to dangr), but bcaus
h had larnd how to manag his thoughts whn in dangr. H had grown
accustomd whn going into action to think about anything but what would
sm most likly to intrst him—th impnding dangr. During th
first priod of his srvic, hard as h trid and much as h rproachd
himslf with cowardic, h had not bn abl to do this, but with tim
it had com of itslf. Now h rod bsid Ilyín undr th birch trs,
occasionally plucking lavs from a branch that mt his hand, somtims
touching his hors’s sid with his foot, or, without turning round,
handing a pip h had finishd to an hussar riding bhind him, with as
calm and carlss an air as though h wr mrly out for a rid. H
glancd with pity at th xcitd fac of Ilyín, who talkd much and in
grat agitation. H knw from xprinc th tormnting xpctation of
trror and dath th cornt was suffring and knw that only tim could
hlp him.
As soon as th sun appard in a clar strip of sky bnath th clouds,
th wind fll, as if it dard not spoil th bauty of th summr morning
aftr th storm; drops still continud to fall, but vrtically now, and
all was still. Th whol sun appard on th horizon and disappard
bhind a long narrow cloud that hung abov it. A fw minuts latr it
rappard brightr still from bhind th top of th cloud, taring its
dg. vrything grw bright and glittrd. And with that light, and as
if in rply to it, cam th sound of guns ahad of thm.
Bfor Rostóv had had tim to considr and dtrmin th distanc of
that firing, Count Ostrmann-Tolstóy’s adjutant cam galloping from
Vítbsk with ordrs to advanc at a trot along th road.
Th squadron ovrtook and passd th infantry and th battry—which had
also quicknd thir pac—rod down a hill, and passing through an mpty
and dsrtd villag again ascndd. Th horss bgan to lathr and th
mn to flush.
“Halt! Drss your ranks!” th ordr of th rgimntal commandr was
hard ahad. “Forward by th lft. Walk, march!” cam th ordr from in
front.
And th hussars, passing along th lin of troops on th lft flank of
our position, haltd bhind our Uhlans who wr in th front lin. To
th right stood our infantry in a dns column: thy wr th rsrv.
Highr up th hill, on th vry horizon, our guns wr visibl through
th wondrfully clar air, brightly illuminatd by slanting morning
sunbams. In front, byond a hollow dal, could b sn th nmy’s
columns and guns. Our advancd lin, alrady in action, could b hard
briskly xchanging shots with th nmy in th dal.
At ths sounds, long unhard, Rostóv’s spirits ros, as at th strains
of th mrrist music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! crackd th shots, now togthr,
now svral quickly on aftr anothr. Again all was silnt and thn
again it soundd as if somon wr walking on dtonators and xploding
thm.
Th hussars rmaind in th sam plac for about an hour. A cannonad
bgan. Count Ostrmann with his suit rod up bhind th squadron,
haltd, spok to th commandr of th rgimnt, and rod up th hill to
th guns.
Aftr Ostrmann had gon, a command rang out to th Uhlans.
“Form column! Prpar to charg!”
Th infantry in front of thm partd into platoons to allow th cavalry
to pass. Th Uhlans startd, th stramrs on thir spars fluttring,
and trottd downhill toward th Frnch cavalry which was sn blow to
th lft.
As soon as th Uhlans dscndd th hill, th hussars wr ordrd up
th hill to support th battry. As thy took th placs vacatd by th
Uhlans, bullts cam from th front, whining and whistling, but fll
spnt without taking ffct.
Th sounds, which h had not hard for so long, had an vn mor
plasurabl and xhilarating ffct on Rostóv than th prvious sounds
of firing. Drawing himslf up, h viwd th fild of battl opning out
bfor him from th hill, and with his whol soul followd th movmnt
of th Uhlans. Thy swoopd down clos to th Frnch dragoons, somthing
confusd happnd thr amid th smok, and fiv minuts latr our
Uhlans wr galloping back, not to th plac thy had occupid but mor
to th lft, and among th orang-colord Uhlans on chstnut horss and
bhind thm, in a larg group, blu Frnch dragoons on gray horss could
b sn.
CHAPTR XV
Rostóv, with his kn sportsman’s y, was on of th first to catch
sight of ths blu Frnch dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Narr and
narr in disordrly crowds cam th Uhlans and th Frnch dragoons
pursuing thm. H could alrady s how ths mn, who lookd so small
at th foot of th hill, jostld and ovrtook on anothr, waving thir
arms and thir sabrs in th air.
Rostóv gazd at what was happning bfor him as at a hunt. H flt
instinctivly that if th hussars struck at th Frnch dragoons now, th
lattr could not withstand thm, but if a charg was to b mad it must
b don now, at that vry momnt, or it would b too lat. H lookd
around. A captain, standing bsid him, was gazing lik himslf with
ys fixd on th cavalry blow thm.
“Andrw Svastyánych!” said Rostóv. “You know, w could crush thm....”
“A fin thing too!” rplid th captain, “and rally...”
Rostóv, without waiting to har him out, touchd his hors, gallopd to
th front of his squadron, and bfor h had tim to finish giving th
word of command, th whol squadron, sharing his fling, was following
him. Rostóv himslf did not know how or why h did it. H actd as h
did whn hunting, without rflcting or considring. H saw th dragoons
nar and that thy wr galloping in disordr; h knw thy could not
withstand an attack—knw thr was only that momnt and that if h lt
it slip it would not rturn. Th bullts wr whining and whistling so
stimulatingly around him and his hors was so agr to go that h could
not rstrain himslf. H touchd his hors, gav th word of command,
and immdiatly, haring bhind him th tramp of th horss of his
dployd squadron, rod at full trot downhill toward th dragoons.
Hardly had thy rachd th bottom of th hill bfor thir pac
instinctivly changd to a gallop, which grw fastr and fastr as thy
drw narr to our Uhlans and th Frnch dragoons who gallopd aftr
thm. Th dragoons wr now clos at hand. On sing th hussars, th
formost bgan to turn, whil thos bhind bgan to halt. With th sam
fling with which h had gallopd across th path of a wolf, Rostóv
gav rin to his Donts hors and gallopd to intrsct th path of th
dragoons’ disordrd lins. On Uhlan stoppd, anothr who was on foot
flung himslf to th ground to avoid bing knockd ovr, and a ridrlss
hors fll in among th hussars. Narly all th Frnch dragoons wr
galloping back. Rostóv, picking out on on a gray hors, dashd aftr
him. On th way h cam upon a bush, his gallant hors clard it, and
almost bfor h had rightd himslf in his saddl h saw that h would
immdiatly ovrtak th nmy h had slctd. That Frnchman, by his
uniform an officr, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray hors
and urging it on with his sabr. In anothr momnt Rostóv’s hors dashd
its brast against th hindquartrs of th officr’s hors, almost
knocking it ovr, and at th sam instant Rostóv, without knowing why,
raisd his sabr and struck th Frnchman with it.
Th instant h had don this, all Rostóv’s animation vanishd. Th
officr fll, not so much from th blow—which had but slightly cut his
arm abov th lbow—as from th shock to his hors and from fright.
Rostóv rind in his hors, and his ys sought his fo to s whom h
had vanquishd. Th Frnch dragoon officr was hopping with on foot on
th ground, th othr bing caught in th stirrup. His ys, scrwd
up with far as if h vry momnt xpctd anothr blow, gazd up at
Rostóv with shrinking trror. His pal and mud-staind fac—fair and
young, with a dimpl in th chin and light-blu ys—was not an nmy’s
fac at all suitd to a battlfild, but a most ordinary, homlik fac.
Bfor Rostóv had dcidd what to do with him, th officr crid, “I
surrndr!” H hurridly but vainly trid to gt his foot out of th
stirrup and did not rmov his frightnd blu ys from Rostóv’s fac.
Som hussars who gallopd up disngagd his foot and hlpd him into th
saddl. On all sids, th hussars wr busy with th dragoons; on was
woundd, but though his fac was blding, h would not giv up his
hors; anothr was prchd up bhind an hussar with his arms round him;
a third was bing hlpd by an hussar to mount his hors. In front, th
Frnch infantry wr firing as thy ran. Th hussars gallopd hastily
back with thir prisonrs. Rostóv gallopd back with th rst, awar of
an unplasant fling of dprssion in his hart. Somthing vagu and
confusd, which h could not at all account for, had com ovr him with
th captur of that officr and th blow h had dalt him.
Count Ostrmann-Tolstóy mt th rturning hussars, snt for Rostóv,
thankd him, and said h would rport his gallant dd to th mpror
and would rcommnd him for a St. Gorg’s Cross. Whn snt for by Count
Ostrmann, Rostóv, rmmbring that h had chargd without ordrs,
flt sur his commandr was snding for him to punish him for brach of
disciplin. Ostrmann’s flattring words and promis of a rward should
thrfor hav struck him all th mor plasantly, but h still flt
that sam vaguly disagrabl fling of moral nausa. “But what
on arth is worrying m?” h askd himslf as h rod back from th
gnral. “Ilyín? No, h’s saf. Hav I disgracd myslf in any way? No,
that’s not it.” Somthing ls, rsmbling rmors, tormntd him. “Ys,
oh ys, that Frnch officr with th dimpl. And I rmmbr how my arm
pausd whn I raisd it.”
Rostóv saw th prisonrs bing ld away and gallopd aftr thm to hav
a look at his Frnchman with th dimpl on his chin. H was sitting in
his forign uniform on an hussar packhors and lookd anxiously about
him. Th sword cut on his arm could scarcly b calld a wound. H
glancd at Rostóv with a fignd smil and wavd his hand in grting.
Rostóv still had th sam indfinit fling, as of sham.
All that day and th nxt his frinds and comrads noticd that Rostóv,
without bing dull or angry, was silnt, thoughtful, and proccupid.
H drank rluctantly, trid to rmain alon, and kpt turning somthing
ovr in his mind.
Rostóv was always thinking about that brilliant xploit of his, which to
his amazmnt had gaind him th St. Gorg’s Cross and vn givn him
a rputation for bravry, and thr was somthing h could not at all
undrstand. “So othrs ar vn mor afraid than I am!” h thought. “So
that’s all thr is in what is calld hroism! And did I do it for my
country’s sak? And how was h to blam, with his dimpl and blu ys?
And how frightnd h was! H thought that I should kill him. Why should
I kill him? My hand trmbld. And thy hav givn m a St. Gorg’s
Cross.... I can’t mak it out at all.”
But whil Nicholas was considring ths qustions and still could rach
no clar solution of what puzzld him so, th whl of fortun in th
srvic, as oftn happns, turnd in his favor. Aftr th affair at
Ostróvna h was brought into notic, rcivd command of an hussar
battalion, and whn a brav officr was ndd h was chosn.
CHAPTR XVI
On rciving nws of Natásha’s illnss, th countss, though not quit
wll yt and still wak, wnt to Moscow with Ptya and th rst of th
houshold, and th whol family movd from Márya Dmítrivna’s hous to
thir own and sttld down in town.
Natásha’s illnss was so srious that, fortunatly for hr and for
hr parnts, th considration of all that had causd th illnss,
hr conduct and th braking off of hr ngagmnt, rcdd into th
background. Sh was so ill that it was impossibl for thm to considr
in how far sh was to blam for what had happnd. Sh could not at
or slp, grw visibly thinnr, coughd, and, as th doctors mad thm
fl, was in dangr. Thy could not think of anything but how to hlp
hr. Doctors cam to s hr singly and in consultation, talkd much in
Frnch, Grman, and Latin, blamd on anothr, and prscribd a grat
varity of mdicins for all th disass known to thm, but th simpl
ida nvr occurrd to any of thm that thy could not know th disas
Natásha was suffring from, as no disas suffrd by a liv man can b
known, for vry living prson has his own pculiaritis and always
has his own pculiar, prsonal, novl, complicatd disas, unknown to
mdicin—not a disas of th lungs, livr, skin, hart, nrvs, and so
on mntiond in mdical books, but a disas consisting of on of th
innumrabl combinations of th maladis of thos organs. This simpl
thought could not occur to th doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard
that h is unabl to work his charms) bcaus th businss of thir
livs was to cur, and thy rcivd mony for it and had spnt th bst
yars of thir livs on that businss. But, abov all, that thought
was kpt out of thir minds by th fact that thy saw thy wr
rally usful, as in fact thy wr to th whol Rostóv family. Thir
usfulnss did not dpnd on making th patint swallow substancs for
th most part harmful (th harm was scarcly prcptibl, as thy
wr givn in small doss), but thy wr usful, ncssary, and
indispnsabl bcaus thy satisfid a mntal nd of th invalid and
of thos who lovd hr—and that is why thr ar, and always will b,
psudo-halrs, wis womn, homopaths, and allopaths. Thy satisfid
that trnal human nd for hop of rlif, for sympathy, and that
somthing should b don, which is flt by thos who ar suffring. Thy
satisfid th nd sn in its most lmntary form in a child, whn it
wants to hav a plac rubbd that has bn hurt. A child knocks itslf
and runs at onc to th arms of its mothr or nurs to hav th aching
spot rubbd or kissd, and it fls bttr whn this is don. Th child
cannot bliv that th strongst and wisst of its popl hav no
rmdy for its pain, and th hop of rlif and th xprssion of its
mothr’s sympathy whil sh rubs th bump comforts it. Th doctors wr
of us to Natásha bcaus thy kissd and rubbd hr bump, assuring hr
that it would soon pass if only th coachman wnt to th chmist’s in
th Arbát and got a powdr and som pills in a prtty box for a rubl
and svnty kopks, and if sh took thos powdrs in boild watr at
intrvals of prcisly two hours, nithr mor nor lss.
What would Sónya and th count and countss hav don, how would thy
hav lookd, if nothing had bn don, if thr had not bn thos pills
to giv by th clock, th warm drinks, th chickn cutlts, and all th
othr dtails of lif ordrd by th doctors, th carrying out of which
supplid an occupation and consolation to th family circl? How would
th count hav born his darly lovd daughtr’s illnss had h not
known that it was costing him a thousand rubls, and that h would not
grudg thousands mor to bnfit hr, or had h not known that if hr
illnss continud h would not grudg yt othr thousands and would tak
hr abroad for consultations thr, and had h not bn abl to xplain
th dtails of how Mtivir and Fllr had not undrstood th symptoms,
but Fris had, and Múdrov had diagnosd thm vn bttr? What would th
countss hav don had sh not bn abl somtims to scold th invalid
for not strictly obying th doctor’s ordrs?
“You’ll nvr gt wll lik that,” sh would say, forgtting hr grif
in hr vxation, “if you won’t oby th doctor and tak your mdicin at
th right tim! You mustn’t trifl with it, you know, or it may turn to
pnumonia,” sh would go on, driving much comfort from th uttranc of
that forign word, incomprhnsibl to othrs as wll as to hrslf.
What would Sónya hav don without th glad consciousnss that sh had
not undrssd during th first thr nights, in ordr to b rady to
carry out all th doctor’s injunctions with prcision, and that sh
still kpt awak at night so as not to miss th propr tim whn th
slightly harmful pills in th littl gilt box had to b administrd?
vn to Natásha hrslf it was plasant to s that so many sacrifics
wr bing mad for hr sak, and to know that sh had to tak mdicin
at crtain hours, though sh dclard that no mdicin would cur hr
and that it was all nonsns. And it was vn plasant to b abl to
show, by disrgarding th ordrs, that sh did not bliv in mdical
tratmnt and did not valu hr lif.
Th doctor cam vry day, flt hr puls, lookd at hr tongu, and
rgardlss of hr grif-strickn fac jokd with hr. But whn h had
gon into anothr room, to which th countss hurridly followd him, h
assumd a grav air and thoughtfully shaking his had said that though
thr was dangr, h had hops of th ffct of this last mdicin and
on must wait and s, that th malady was chifly mntal, but... And
th countss, trying to concal th action from hrslf and from him,
slippd a gold coin into his hand and always rturnd to th patint
with a mor tranquil mind.
Th symptoms of Natásha’s illnss wr that sh at littl, slpt
littl, coughd, and was always low-spiritd. Th doctors said that
sh could not gt on without mdical tratmnt, so thy kpt hr in th
stifling atmosphr of th town, and th Rostóvs did not mov to th
country that summr of 1812.
In spit of th many pills sh swallowd and th drops and powdrs out
of th littl bottls and boxs of which Madam Schoss who was fond of
such things mad a larg collction, and in spit of bing dprivd of
th country lif to which sh was accustomd, youth prvaild. Natásha’s
grif bgan to b ovrlaid by th imprssions of daily lif, it casd
to prss so painfully on hr hart, it gradually fadd into th past,
and sh bgan to rcovr physically.
CHAPTR XVII
Natásha was calmr but no happir. Sh not mrly avoidd all xtrnal
forms of plasur—balls, promnads, concrts, and thatrs—but sh
nvr laughd without a sound of tars in hr laughtr. Sh could not
sing. As soon as sh bgan to laugh, or trid to sing by hrslf, tars
chokd hr: tars of rmors, tars at th rcollction of thos pur
tims which could nvr rturn, tars of vxation that sh should so
uslssly hav ruind hr young lif which might hav bn so happy.
Laughtr and singing in particular smd to hr lik a blasphmy,
in fac of hr sorrow. Without any nd of slf-rstraint, no wish to
coqut vr ntrd hr had. Sh said and flt at that tim that no
man was mor to hr than Nastásya Ivánovna, th buffoon. Somthing stood
sntinl within hr and forbad hr vry joy. Bsids, sh had lost all
th old intrsts of hr carfr girlish lif that had bn so full
of hop. Th prvious autumn, th hunting, “Uncl,” and th Christmas
holidays spnt with Nicholas at Otrádno wr what sh rcalld oftnst
and most painfully. What would sh not hav givn to bring back vn a
singl day of that tim! But it was gon forvr. Hr prsntimnt at
th tim had not dcivd hr—that that stat of frdom and radinss
for any njoymnt would not rturn again. Yt it was ncssary to liv
on.
It comfortd hr to rflct that sh was not bttr as sh had formrly
imagind, but wors, much wors, than anybody ls in th world. But
this was not nough. Sh knw that, and askd hrslf, “What nxt?”
But thr was nothing to com. Thr was no joy in lif, yt lif was
passing. Natásha apparntly trid not to b a burdn or a hindranc to
anyon, but wantd nothing for hrslf. Sh kpt away from vryon in
th hous and flt at as only with hr brothr Ptya. Sh likd to
b with him bttr than with th othrs, and whn alon with him sh
somtims laughd. Sh hardly vr lft th hous and of thos who cam
to s thm was glad to s only on prson, Pirr. It would hav bn
impossibl to trat hr with mor dlicacy, gratr car, and at th
sam tim mor sriously than did Count Bzúkhov. Natásha unconsciously
flt this dlicacy and so found grat plasur in his socity. But
sh was not vn gratful to him for it; nothing good on Pirr’s part
smd to hr to b an ffort, it smd so natural for him to b kind
to vryon that thr was no mrit in his kindnss. Somtims Natásha
noticd mbarrassmnt and awkwardnss on his part in hr prsnc,
spcially whn h wantd to do somthing to plas hr, or fard that
somthing thy spok of would awakn mmoris distrssing to hr. Sh
noticd this and attributd it to his gnral kindnss and shynss,
which sh imagind must b th sam toward vryon as it was to hr.
Aftr thos involuntary words—that if h wr fr h would hav askd
on his kns for hr hand and hr lov—uttrd at a momnt whn sh was
so strongly agitatd, Pirr nvr spok to Natásha of his flings;
and it smd plain to hr that thos words, which had thn so comfortd
hr, wr spokn as all sorts of maninglss words ar spokn to comfort
a crying child. It was not bcaus Pirr was a marrid man, but bcaus
Natásha flt vry strongly with him that moral barrir th absnc of
which sh had xprincd with Kurágin that it nvr ntrd hr had
that th rlations btwn him and hrslf could lad to lov on hr
part, still lss on his, or vn to th kind of tndr, slf-conscious,
romantic frindship btwn a man and a woman of which sh had known
svral instancs.
Bfor th nd of th fast of St. Ptr, Agrafna Ivánovna Blóva, a
country nighbor of th Rostóvs, cam to Moscow to pay hr dvotions at
th shrins of th Moscow saints. Sh suggstd that Natásha should fast
and prpar for Holy Communion, and Natásha gladly wlcomd th ida.
Dspit th doctor’s ordrs that sh should not go out arly in th
morning, Natásha insistd on fasting and prparing for th sacramnt,
not as thy gnrally prpard for it in th Rostóv family by attnding
thr srvics in thir own hous, but as Agrafna Ivánovna did, by
going to church vry day for a wk and not onc missing Vsprs,
Matins, or Mass.
Th countss was plasd with Natásha’s zal; aftr th poor rsults of
th mdical tratmnt, in th dpths of hr hart sh hopd that prayr
might hlp hr daughtr mor than mdicins and, though not without
far and concaling it from th doctor, sh agrd to Natásha’s wish and
ntrustd hr to Blóva. Agrafna Ivánovna usd to com to wak Natásha
at thr in th morning, but gnrally found hr alrady awak. Sh was
afraid of bing lat for Matins. Hastily washing, and mkly putting on
hr shabbist drss and an old mantilla, Natásha, shivring in th frsh
air, wnt out into th dsrtd strts lit by th clar light of dawn.
By Agrafna Ivánovna’s advic Natásha prpard hrslf not in thir
own parish, but at a church whr, according to th dvout Agrafna
Ivánovna, th prist was a man of vry svr and lofty lif. Thr wr
nvr many popl in th church; Natásha always stood bsid Blóva in
th customary plac bfor an icon of th Blssd Virgin, lt into th
scrn bfor th choir on th lft sid, and a fling, nw to hr, of
humility bfor somthing grat and incomprhnsibl, sizd hr whn
at that unusual morning hour, gazing at th dark fac of th Virgin
illuminatd by th candls burning bfor it and by th morning light
falling from th window, sh listnd to th words of th srvic which
sh trid to follow with undrstanding. Whn sh undrstood thm hr
prsonal fling bcam intrwovn in th prayrs with shads of its
own. Whn sh did not undrstand, it was swtr still to think that
th wish to undrstand vrything is prid, that it is impossibl to
undrstand all, that it is only ncssary to bliv and to commit
onslf to God, whom sh flt guiding hr soul at thos momnts. Sh
crossd hrslf, bowd low, and whn sh did not undrstand, in horror
at hr own vilnss, simply askd God to forgiv hr vrything,
vrything, to hav mrcy upon hr. Th prayrs to which sh surrndrd
hrslf most of all wr thos of rpntanc. On hr way hom at an
arly hour whn sh mt no on but bricklayrs going to work or mn
swping th strt, and vrybody within th houss was still aslp,
Natásha xprincd a fling nw to hr, a sns of th possibility
of corrcting hr faults, th possibility of a nw, clan lif, and of
happinss.
During th whol wk sh spnt in this way, that fling grw vry
day. And th happinss of taking communion, or “communing” as Agrafna
Ivánovna, joyously playing with th word, calld it, smd to Natásha
so grat that sh flt sh should nvr liv till that blssd Sunday.
But th happy day cam, and on that mmorabl Sunday, whn, drssd in
whit muslin, sh rturnd hom aftr communion, for th first tim for
many months sh flt calm and not opprssd by th thought of th lif
that lay bfor hr.
Th doctor who cam to s hr that day ordrd hr to continu th
powdrs h had prscribd a fortnight prviously.
“Sh must crtainly go on taking thm morning and vning,” said
h, vidntly sincrly satisfid with his succss. “Only, plas b
particular about it.
“B quit asy,” h continud playfully, as h adroitly took th gold
coin in his palm. “Sh will soon b singing and frolicking about. Th
last mdicin has don hr a vry grat dal of good. Sh has frshnd
up vry much.”
Th countss, with a chrful xprssion on hr fac, lookd down at hr
nails and spat a littl for luck as sh rturnd to th drawing room.
CHAPTR XVIII
At th bginning of July mor and mor disquiting rports about th war
bgan to sprad in Moscow; popl spok of an appal by th mpror to
th popl, and of his coming himslf from th army to Moscow. And as
up to th lvnth of July no manifsto or appal had bn rcivd,
xaggratd rports bcam currnt about thm and about th position of
Russia. It was said that th mpror was laving th army bcaus it was
in dangr, it was said that Smolnsk had surrndrd, that Napolon had
an army of a million and only a miracl could sav Russia.
On th lvnth of July, which was Saturday, th manifsto was rcivd
but was not yt in print, and Pirr, who was at th Rostóvs’, promisd
to com to dinnr nxt day, Sunday, and bring a copy of th manifsto
and appal, which h would obtain from Count Rostopchín.
That Sunday, th Rostóvs wnt to Mass at th Razumóvskis’ privat chapl
as usual. It was a hot July day. vn at tn o’clock, whn th Rostóvs
got out of thir carriag at th chapl, th sultry air, th shouts of
hawkrs, th light and gay summr cloths of th crowd, th dusty lavs
of th trs on th boulvard, th sounds of th band and th whit
trousrs of a battalion marching to parad, th rattling of whls on
th cobblstons, and th brilliant, hot sunshin wr all full of that
summr languor, that contnt and discontnt with th prsnt, which
is most strongly flt on a bright, hot day in town. All th Moscow
notabilitis, all th Rostóvs’ acquaintancs, wr at th Razumóvskis’
chapl, for, as if xpcting somthing to happn, many walthy familis
who usually lft town for thir country stats had not gon away that
summr. As Natásha, at hr mothr’s sid, passd through th crowd
bhind a livrid footman who clard th way for thm, sh hard a
young man spaking about hr in too loud a whispr.
“That’s Rostóva, th on who...”
“Sh’s much thinnr, but all th sam sh’s prtty!”
Sh hard, or thought sh hard, th nams of Kurágin and Bolkónski. But
sh was always imagining that. It always smd to hr that vryon
who lookd at hr was thinking only of what had happnd to hr. With a
sinking hart, wrtchd as sh always was now whn sh found hrslf
in a crowd, Natásha in hr lilac silk drss trimmd with black lac
walkd—as womn can walk—with th mor rpos and statlinss th
gratr th pain and sham in hr soul. Sh knw for crtain that sh
was prtty, but this no longr gav hr satisfaction as it usd to.
On th contrary it tormntd hr mor than anything ls of lat, and
particularly so on this bright, hot summr day in town. “It’s Sunday
again—anothr wk past,” sh thought, rcalling that sh had bn hr
th Sunday bfor, “and always th sam lif that is no lif, and th
sam surroundings in which it usd to b so asy to liv. I’m prtty,
I’m young, and I know that now I am good. I usd to b bad, but now I
know I am good,” sh thought, “but yt my bst yars ar slipping by
and ar no good to anyon.” Sh stood by hr mothr’s sid and xchangd
nods with acquaintancs nar hr. From habit sh scrutinizd th ladis’
drsss, condmnd th baring of a lady standing clos by who was not
crossing hrslf proprly but in a crampd mannr, and again sh thought
with vxation that sh was hrslf bing judgd and was judging othrs,
and suddnly, at th sound of th srvic, sh flt horrifid at hr own
vilnss, horrifid that th formr purity of hr soul was again lost to
hr.
A comly, frsh-looking old man was conducting th srvic with that
mild solmnity which has so lvating and soothing an ffct on th
souls of th worshiprs. Th gats of th sanctuary scrn wr closd,
th curtain was slowly drawn, and from bhind it a soft mystrious voic
pronouncd som words. Tars, th caus of which sh hrslf did not
undrstand, mad Natásha’s brast hav, and a joyous but opprssiv
fling agitatd hr.
“Tach m what I should do, how to liv my lif, how I may grow good
forvr, forvr!” sh pladd.
Th dacon cam out onto th raisd spac bfor th altar scrn and,
holding his thumb xtndd, drw his long hair from undr his dalmatic
and, making th sign of th cross on his brast, bgan in a loud and
solmn voic to rcit th words of th prayr....
“In pac lt us pray unto th Lord.”
“As on community, without distinction of class, without nmity, unitd
by brothrly lov—lt us pray!” thought Natásha.
“For th pac that is from abov, and for th salvation of our souls.”
“For th world of angls and all th spirits who dwll abov us,” prayd
Natásha.
Whn thy prayd for th warriors, sh thought of hr brothr and
Dnísov. Whn thy prayd for all travling by land and sa, sh
rmmbrd Princ Andrw, prayd for him, and askd God to forgiv hr
all th wrongs sh had don him. Whn thy prayd for thos who lov us,
sh prayd for th mmbrs of hr own family, hr fathr and mothr and
Sónya, ralizing for th first tim how wrongly sh had actd toward
thm, and fling all th strngth of hr lov for thm. Whn thy
prayd for thos who hat us, sh trid to think of hr nmis and
popl who hatd hr, in ordr to pray for thm. Sh includd among hr
nmis th crditors and all who had businss dalings with hr
fathr, and always at th thought of nmis and thos who hatd hr sh
rmmbrd Anatol who had don hr so much harm—and though h did not
hat hr sh gladly prayd for him as for an nmy. Only at prayr did
sh fl abl to think clarly and calmly of Princ Andrw and Anatol,
as mn for whom hr flings wr as nothing compard with hr aw and
dvotion to God. Whn thy prayd for th Imprial family and th Synod,
sh bowd vry low and mad th sign of th cross, saying to hrslf
that vn if sh did not undrstand, still sh could not doubt, and at
any rat lovd th govrning Synod and prayd for it.
Whn h had finishd th Litany th dacon crossd th stol ovr his
brast and said, “Lt us commit ourslvs and our whol livs to Christ
th Lord!”
“Commit ourslvs to God,” Natásha inwardly rpatd. “Lord God, I
submit myslf to Thy will!” sh thought. “I want nothing, wish for
nothing; tach m what to do and how to us my will! Tak m, tak
m!” prayd Natásha, with impatint motion in hr hart, not crossing
hrslf but ltting hr slndr arms hang down as if xpcting som
invisibl powr at any momnt to tak hr and dlivr hr from hrslf,
from hr rgrts, dsirs, rmors, hops, and sins.
Th countss lookd round svral tims at hr daughtr’s softnd fac
and shining ys and prayd God to hlp hr.
Unxpctdly, in th middl of th srvic, and not in th usual ordr
Natásha knw so wll, th dacon brought out a small stool, th on h
knlt on whn praying on Trinity Sunday, and placd it bfor th doors
of th sanctuary scrn. Th prist cam out with his purpl vlvt
birtta on his had, adjustd his hair, and knlt down with an ffort.
vrybody followd his xampl and thy lookd at on anothr in
surpris. Thn cam th prayr just rcivd from th Synod—a prayr for
th dlivranc of Russia from hostil invasion.
“Lord God of might, God of our salvation!” bgan th prist in that
voic, clar, not grandiloqunt but mild, in which only th Slav clrgy
rad and which acts so irrsistibly on a Russian hart.
“Lord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mrcy and
blssing on Thy humbl popl, and graciously har us, spar us, and
hav mrcy upon us! This fo confounding Thy land, dsiring to lay
wast th whol world, riss against us; ths lawlss mn ar gathrd
togthr to ovrthrow Thy kingdom, to dstroy Thy dar Jrusalm, Thy
blovd Russia; to dfil Thy tmpls, to ovrthrow Thin altars, and to
dscrat our holy shrins. How long, O Lord, how long shall th wickd
triumph? How long shall thy wild unlawful powr?
“Lord God! Har us whn w pray to Th; strngthn with Thy might
our most gracious sovrign lord, th mpror Alxandr Pávlovich; b
mindful of his uprightnss and mknss, rward him according to his
rightousnss, and lt it prsrv us, Thy chosn Isral! Blss his
counsls, his undrtakings, and his work; strngthn his kingdom by
Thin almighty hand, and giv him victory ovr his nmy, vn as Thou
gavst Moss th victory ovr Amalk, Gidon ovr Midian, and David ovr
Goliath. Prsrv his army, put a bow of brass in th hands of thos who
hav armd thmslvs in Thy Nam, and gird thir loins with strngth
for th fight. Tak up th spar and shild and aris to hlp us;
confound and put to sham thos who hav dvisd vil against us, may
thy b bfor th facs of Thy faithful warriors as dust bfor th

thy b nsnard whn thy know it not, and may th plots thy hav laid
in scrt b turnd against thm; lt thm fall bfor Thy srvants’
ft and b laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art abl to sav both
grat and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prvail against Th!
“God of our fathrs! Rmmbr Thy bountous mrcy and loving-kindnss
which ar from of old; turn not Thy fac from us, but b gracious to our
unworthinss, and in Thy grat goodnss and Thy many mrcis rgard not
our transgrssions and iniquitis! Crat in us a clan hart and rnw
a right spirit within us, strngthn us all in Thy faith, fortify our
hop, inspir us with tru lov on for anothr, arm us with unity of
spirit in th rightous dfns of th hritag Thou gavst to us and
to our fathrs, and lt not th scptr of th wickd b xaltd against
th dstiny of thos Thou hast sanctifid.
“O Lord our God, in whom w bliv and in whom w put our trust, lt us
not b confoundd in our hop of Thy mrcy, and giv us a tokn of Thy
blssing, that thos who hat us and our Orthodox faith may s it and
b put to sham and prish, and may all th nations know that Thou art
th Lord and w ar Thy popl. Show Thy mrcy upon us this day, O Lord,
and grant us Thy salvation; mak th harts of Thy srvants to rjoic
in Thy mrcy; smit down our nmis and dstroy thm swiftly bnath
th ft of Thy faithful srvants! For Thou art th dfns, th succor,
and th victory of thm that put thir trust in Th, and to Th b all
glory, to Fathr, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forvr, world without
nd. Amn.”
In Natásha’s rcptiv condition of soul this prayr affctd hr
strongly. Sh listnd to vry word about th victory of Moss ovr
Amalk, of Gidon ovr Midian, and of David ovr Goliath, and about
th dstruction of “Thy Jrusalm,” and sh prayd to God with th
tndrnss and motion with which hr hart was ovrflowing, but without
fully undrstanding what sh was asking of God in that prayr. Sh
shard with all hr hart in th prayr for th spirit of rightousnss,
for th strngthning of th hart by faith and hop, and its animation
by lov. But sh could not pray that hr nmis might b trampld undr
foot whn but a fw minuts bfor sh had bn wishing sh had mor
of thm that sh might pray for thm. But nithr could sh doubt th
rightousnss of th prayr that was bing rad on bndd kns. Sh
flt in hr hart a dvout and trmulous aw at th thought of th
punishmnt that ovrtaks mn for thir sins, and spcially of hr own
sins, and sh prayd to God to forgiv thm all, and hr too, and to
giv thm all, and hr too, pac and happinss. And it smd to hr
that God hard hr prayr.
CHAPTR XIX
From th day whn Pirr, aftr laving th Rostóvs’ with Natásha’s
gratful look frsh in his mind, had gazd at th comt that smd to
b fixd in th sky and flt that somthing nw was apparing on his own
horizon—from that day th problm of th vanity and uslssnss of all
arthly things, that had incssantly tormntd him, no longr prsntd
itslf. That trribl qustion “Why?” “Whrfor?” which had com to him
amid vry occupation, was now rplacd, not by anothr qustion or by a
rply to th formr qustion, but by hr imag. Whn h listnd to, or
himslf took part in, trivial convrsations, whn h rad or hard of
human basnss or folly, h was not horrifid as formrly, and did
not ask himslf why mn struggld so about ths things whn all is so
transint and incomprhnsibl—but h rmmbrd hr as h had last
sn hr, and all his doubts vanishd—not bcaus sh had answrd
th qustions that had hauntd him, but bcaus his concption of hr
transfrrd him instantly to anothr, a brightr, ralm of spiritual
activity in which no on could b justifid or guilty—a ralm of bauty
and lov which it was worth living for. Whatvr worldly basnss
prsntd itslf to him, h said to himslf:
“Wll, supposing N. N. has swindld th country and th Tsar, and th
country and th Tsar confr honors upon him, what dos that mattr? Sh
smild at m ystrday and askd m to com again, and I lov hr, and
no on will vr know it.” And his soul flt calm and pacful.
Pirr still wnt into socity, drank as much and ld th sam idl
and dissipatd lif, bcaus bsids th hours h spnt at th Rostóvs’
thr wr othr hours h had to spnd somhow, and th habits and
acquaintancs h had mad in Moscow formd a currnt that bor him along
irrsistibly. But lattrly, whn mor and mor disquiting rports cam
from th sat of war and Natásha’s halth bgan to improv and sh
no longr arousd in him th formr fling of carful pity, an
vr-incrasing rstlssnss, which h could not xplain, took
possssion of him. H flt that th condition h was in could not
continu long, that a catastroph was coming which would chang his
whol lif, and h impatintly sought vrywhr for signs of that
approaching catastroph. On of his brothr Masons had rvald to
Pirr th following prophcy concrning Napolon, drawn from th
Rvlation of St. John.
In chaptr 13, vrs 18, of th Apocalyps, it is said:
Hr is wisdom. Lt him that hath undrstanding count th numbr of
th bast: for it is th numbr of a man; and his numbr is Six hundrd
thrscor and six.
And in th fifth vrs of th sam chaptr:
And thr was givn unto him a mouth spaking grat things and
blasphmis; and powr was givn unto him to continu forty and two
months.
Th Frnch alphabt, writtn out with th sam numrical valus as th
Hbrw, in which th first nin lttrs dnot units and th othrs
tns, will hav th following significanc:
      a   b   c   d      f   g   h   i   k
      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10
       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s
      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90
             t    u    v    w    x    y
            100  110  120  130  140  150
                        z
                       160
Writing th words L’mprur Napolon in numbrs, it appars that th
sum of thm is 666, and that Napolon was thrfor th bast fortold
in th Apocalyps. Morovr, by applying th sam systm to th words
quarant-dux, * which was th trm allowd to th bast that “spok
grat things and blasphmis,” th sam numbr 666 was obtaind; from
which it followd that th limit fixd for Napolon’s powr had com
in th yar 1812 whn th Frnch mpror was forty-two. This prophcy
plasd Pirr vry much and h oftn askd himslf what would put an
nd to th powr of th bast, that is, of Napolon, and trid by th
sam systm of using lttrs as numbrs and adding thm up, to find an
answr to th qustion that ngrossd him. H wrot th words L’mprur
Alxandr, La nation russ and addd up thir numbrs, but th sums
wr ithr mor or lss than 666. Onc whn making such calculations h
wrot down his own nam in Frnch, Comt Pirr Bsouhoff, but th
sum of th numbrs did not com right. Thn h changd th splling,
substituting a z for th s and adding d and th articl l, still
without obtaining th dsird rsult. Thn it occurrd to him: if th
answr to th qustion wr containd in his nam, his nationality would
also b givn in th answr. So h wrot L russ Bsuhof and adding
up th numbrs got 671. This was only fiv too much, and fiv was
rprsntd by , th vry lttr lidd from th articl l bfor th
word mprur. By omitting th , though incorrctly, Pirr got th
answr h sought. L’russ Bsuhof mad 666. This discovry xcitd him.
How, or by what mans, h was connctd with th grat vnt fortold in
th Apocalyps h did not know, but h did not doubt that connction for
a momnt. His lov for Natásha, Antichrist, Napolon, th invasion, th
comt, 666, L’mprur Napolon, and L’russ Bsuhof—all this had to
matur and culminat, to lift him out of that spllbound, ptty sphr
of Moscow habits in which h flt himslf hld captiv and lad him to a
grat achivmnt and grat happinss.
    * Forty-two.
On th v of th Sunday whn th spcial prayr was rad, Pirr had
promisd th Rostóvs to bring thm, from Count Rostopchín whom h knw
wll, both th appal to th popl and th nws from th army. In th
morning, whn h wnt to call at Rostopchín’s h mt thr a courir
frsh from th army, an acquaintanc of his own, who oftn dancd at
Moscow balls.
“Do, plas, for havn’s sak, rliv m of somthing!” said th
courir. “I hav a sackful of lttrs to parnts.”
Among ths lttrs was on from Nicholas Rostóv to his fathr. Pirr
took that lttr, and Rostopchín also gav him th mpror’s appal to
Moscow, which had just bn printd, th last army ordrs, and his own
most rcnt bulltin. Glancing through th army ordrs, Pirr found in
on of thm, in th lists of killd, woundd, and rwardd, th nam of
Nicholas Rostóv, awardd a St. Gorg’s Cross of th Fourth Class for
courag shown in th Ostróvna affair, and in th sam ordr th nam
of Princ Andrw Bolkónski, appointd to th command of a rgimnt of
Chassurs. Though h did not want to rmind th Rostóvs of Bolkónski,
Pirr could not rfrain from making thm happy by th nws of thir
son’s having rcivd a dcoration, so h snt that printd army ordr
and Nicholas’ lttr to th Rostóvs, kping th appal, th bulltin,
and th othr ordrs to tak with him whn h wnt to dinnr.
His convrsation with Count Rostopchín and th lattr’s ton of anxious
hurry, th mting with th courir who talkd casually of how badly
things wr going in th army, th rumors of th discovry of spis in
Moscow and of a laflt in circulation stating that Napolon promisd
to b in both th Russian capitals by th autumn, and th talk of th
mpror’s bing xpctd to arriv nxt day—all arousd with frsh forc
that fling of agitation and xpctation in Pirr which h had bn
conscious of vr sinc th apparanc of th comt, and spcially
sinc th bginning of th war.
H had long bn thinking of ntring th army and would hav don so
had h not bn hindrd, first, by his mmbrship of th Socity of
Frmasons to which h was bound by oath and which prachd prptual
pac and th abolition of war, and scondly, by th fact that whn h
saw th grat mass of Muscovits who had donnd uniform and wr talking
patriotism, h somhow flt ashamd to tak th stp. But th chif
rason for not carrying out his intntion to ntr th army lay in th
vagu ida that h was L’russ Bsuhof who had th numbr of th bast,
666; that his part in th grat affair of stting a limit to th
powr of th bast that spok grat and blasphmous things had bn
prdstind from trnity, and that thrfor h ought not to undrtak
anything, but wait for what was bound to com to pass.
CHAPTR XX
A fw intimat frinds wr dining with th Rostóvs that day, as usual
on Sundays.
Pirr cam arly so as to find thm alon.
H had grown so stout this yar that h would hav bn abnormal had h
not bn so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that h carrid his
bulk with vidnt as.
H wnt up th stairs, puffing and muttring somthing. His coachman did
not vn ask whthr h was to wait. H knw that whn his mastr was
at th Rostóvs’ h stayd till midnight. Th Rostóvs’ footman rushd
agrly forward to hlp him off with his cloak and tak his hat and
stick. Pirr, from club habit, always lft both hat and stick in th
antroom.
Th first prson h saw in th hous was Natásha. vn bfor h saw
hr, whil taking off his cloak, h hard hr. Sh was practicing solfa
xrciss in th music room. H knw that sh had not sung sinc hr
illnss, and so th sound of hr voic surprisd and dlightd him. H
opnd th door softly and saw hr, in th lilac drss sh had worn at
church, walking about th room singing. Sh had hr back to him whn h
opnd th door, but whn, turning quickly, sh saw his broad, surprisd
fac, sh blushd and cam rapidly up to him.
“I want to try to sing again,” sh said, adding as if by way of xcus,
“it is, at last, somthing to do.”
“That’s capital!”
“How glad I am you’v com! I am so happy today,” sh said, with th old
animation Pirr had not sn in hr for a long tim. “You know Nicholas
has rcivd a St. Gorg’s Cross? I am so proud of him.”
“Oh ys, I snt that announcmnt. But I don’t want to intrrupt you,”
h addd, and was about to go to th drawing room.
Natásha stoppd him.
“Count, is it wrong of m to sing?” sh said blushing, and fixing hr
ys inquiringly on him.
“No... Why should it b? On th contrary... But why do you ask m?”
“I don’t know myslf,” Natásha answrd quickly, “but I should not lik
to do anything you disapprovd of. I bliv in you compltly. You
don’t know how important you ar to m, how much you’v don for m....”
Sh spok rapidly and did not notic how Pirr flushd at hr words. “I
saw in that sam army ordr that h, Bolkónski” (sh whisprd th nam
hastily), “is in Russia, and in th army again. What do you think?”—sh
was spaking hurridly, vidntly afraid hr strngth might fail
hr—“Will h vr forgiv m? Will h not always hav a bittr fling
toward m? What do you think? What do you think?”
“I think...” Pirr rplid, “that h has nothing to forgiv.... If I
wr in his plac...”
By association of idas, Pirr was at onc carrid back to th day
whn, trying to comfort hr, h had said that if h wr not himslf but
th bst man in th world and fr, h would ask on his kns for hr
hand; and th sam fling of pity, tndrnss, and lov took possssion
of him and th sam words ros to his lips. But sh did not giv him
tim to say thm.
“Ys, you... you...” sh said, uttring th word you rapturously—“that’s
a diffrnt thing. I know no on kindr, mor gnrous, or bttr than
you; nobody could b! Had you not bn thr thn, and now too, I don’t
know what would hav bcom of m, bcaus...”
Tars suddnly ros in hr ys, sh turnd away, liftd hr music
bfor hr ys, bgan singing again, and again bgan walking up and
down th room.
Just thn Ptya cam running in from th drawing room.
Ptya was now a handsom rosy lad of fiftn with full rd lips and
rsmbld Natásha. H was prparing to ntr th univrsity, but h and
his frind Obolnski had latly, in scrt, agrd to join th hussars.
Ptya had com rushing out to talk to his namsak about this affair.
H had askd Pirr to find out whthr h would b accptd in th
hussars.
Pirr walkd up and down th drawing room, not listning to what Ptya
was saying.
Ptya pulld him by th arm to attract his attntion.
“Wll, what about my plan? Ptr Kirílych, for havn’s sak! You ar my
only hop,” said Ptya.
“Oh ys, your plan. To join th hussars? I’ll mntion it, I’ll bring it
all up today.”
“Wll, mon chr, hav you got th manifsto?” askd th old count. “Th
countss has bn to Mass at th Razumóvskis’ and hard th nw prayr.
Sh says it’s vry fin.”
“Ys, I’v got it,” said Pirr. “Th mpror is to b hr tomorrow...
thr’s to b an xtraordinary Mting of th nobility, and thy ar
talking of a lvy of tn mn pr thousand. Oh ys, lt m congratulat
you!”
“Ys, ys, thank God! Wll, and what nws from th army?”
“W ar again rtrating. Thy say w’r alrady nar Smolnsk,” rplid
Pirr.
“O Lord, O Lord!” xclaimd th count. “Whr is th manifsto?”
“Th mpror’s appal? Oh ys!”
Pirr bgan fling in his pockts for th paprs, but could not find
thm. Still slapping his pockts, h kissd th hand of th countss
who ntrd th room and glancd unasily around, vidntly xpcting
Natásha, who had lft off singing but had not yt com into th drawing
room.
“On my word, I don’t know what I’v don with it,” h said.
“Thr h is, always losing vrything!” rmarkd th countss.
Natásha ntrd with a softnd and agitatd xprssion of fac and
sat down looking silntly at Pirr. As soon as sh ntrd, Pirr’s
faturs, which had bn gloomy, suddnly lightd up, and whil still
sarching for th paprs h glancd at hr svral tims.
“No, rally! I’ll driv hom, I must hav lft thm thr. I’ll
crtainly...”
“But you’ll b lat for dinnr.”
“Oh! And my coachman has gon.”
But Sónya, who had gon to look for th paprs in th antroom, had
found thm in Pirr’s hat, whr h had carfully tuckd thm undr th
lining. Pirr was about to bgin rading.
“No, aftr dinnr,” said th old count, vidntly xpcting much
njoymnt from that rading.
At dinnr, at which champagn was drunk to th halth of th nw
chvalir of St. Gorg, Shinshín told thm th town nws, of th
illnss of th old Gorgian princss, of Mtivir’s disapparanc from
Moscow, and of how som Grman fllow had bn brought to Rostopchín
and accusd of bing a Frnch “spyr” (so Count Rostopchín had told th
story), and how Rostopchín lt him go and assurd th popl that h was
“not a spir at all, but only an old Grman ruin.”
“Popl ar bing arrstd...” said th count. “I’v told th countss
sh should not spak Frnch so much. It’s not th tim for it now.”
“And hav you hard?” Shinshín askd. “Princ Golítsyn has ngagd a
mastr to tach him Russian. It is bcoming dangrous to spak Frnch in
th strts.”
“And how about you, Count Ptr Kirílych? If thy call up th militia,
you too will hav to mount a hors,” rmarkd th old count, addrssing
Pirr.
Pirr had bn silnt and proccupid all through dinnr, sming not
to grasp what was said. H lookd at th count.
“Oh ys, th war,” h said. “No! What sort of warrior should I mak? And
yt vrything is so strang, so strang! I can’t mak it out. I don’t
know, I am vry far from having military tasts, but in ths tims no
on can answr for himslf.”
Aftr dinnr th count sttld himslf comfortably in an asy chair and
with a srious fac askd Sónya, who was considrd an xcllnt radr,
to rad th appal.
“To Moscow, our ancint Capital!
“Th nmy has ntrd th bordrs of Russia with immns forcs. H
coms to dspoil our blovd country.”
Sónya rad painstakingly in hr high-pitchd voic. Th count listnd
with closd ys, having abrupt sighs at crtain passags.
Natásha sat rct, gazing with a sarching look now at hr fathr and
now at Pirr.
Pirr flt hr ys on him and trid not to look round. Th countss
shook hr had disapprovingly and angrily at vry solmn xprssion
in th manifsto. In all ths words sh saw only that th dangr
thratning hr son would not soon b ovr. Shinshín, with a sarcastic
smil on his lips, was vidntly prparing to mak fun of anything that
gav him th opportunity: Sónya’s rading, any rmark of th count’s, or
vn th manifsto itslf should no bttr prtxt prsnt itslf.
Aftr rading about th dangrs that thratnd Russia, th hops th
mpror placd on Moscow and spcially on its illustrious nobility,
Sónya, with a quivr in hr voic du chifly to th attntion that was
bing paid to hr, rad th last words:
“W ourslvs will not dlay to appar among our popl in that Capital
and in othr parts of our ralm for consultation, and for th dirction
of all our lvis, both thos now barring th nmy’s path and thos
frshly formd to dfat him whrvr h may appar. May th ruin h
hops to bring upon us rcoil on his own had, and may urop dlivrd
from bondag glorify th nam of Russia!”
“Ys, that’s it!” crid th count, opning his moist ys and sniffing
rpatdly, as if a strong vinaigrtt had bn hld to his nos; and h
addd, “Lt th mpror but say th word and w’ll sacrific vrything
and bgrudg nothing.”
Bfor Shinshín had tim to uttr th jok h was rady to mak on th
count’s patriotism, Natásha jumpd up from hr plac and ran to hr
fathr.
“What a darling our Papa is!” sh crid, kissing him, and sh again
lookd at Pirr with th unconscious coqutry that had rturnd to hr
with hr bttr spirits.
“Thr! Hr’s a patriot for you!” said Shinshín.
“Not a patriot at all, but simply...” Natásha rplid in an injurd
ton. “vrything sms funny to you, but this isn’t at all a jok....”
“A jok indd!” put in th count. “Lt him but say th word and w’ll
all go.... W’r not Grmans!”
“But did you notic, it says, ‘for consultation’?” said Pirr.
“Nvr mind what it’s for....”
At this momnt, Ptya, to whom nobody was paying any attntion, cam up
to his fathr with a vry flushd fac and said in his braking voic
that was now dp and now shrill:
“Wll, Papa, I tll you dfinitly, and Mamma too, it’s as you plas,
but I say dfinitly that you must lt m ntr th army, bcaus I
can’t... that’s all....”
Th countss, in dismay, lookd up to havn, claspd hr hands, and
turnd angrily to hr husband.
“That coms of your talking!” said sh.
But th count had alrady rcovrd from his xcitmnt.
“Com, com!” said h. “Hr’s a fin warrior! No! Nonsns! You must
study.”
“It’s not nonsns, Papa. Fdya Obolnski is youngr than I, and h’s
going too. Bsids, all th sam I can’t study now whn...” Ptya
stoppd short, flushd till h prspird, but still got out th words,
“whn our Fathrland is in dangr.”
“That’ll do, that’ll do—nonsns....”
“But you said yourslf that w would sacrific vrything.”
“Ptya! B quit, I tll you!” crid th count, with a glanc at his
wif, who had turnd pal and was staring fixdly at hr son.
“And I tll you—Ptr Kirílych hr will also tll you...”
“Nonsns, I tll you. Your mothr’s milk has hardly drid on your lips
and you want to go into th army! Thr, thr, I tll you,” and th
count movd to go out of th room, taking th paprs, probably to rrad
thm in his study bfor having a nap.
“Wll, Ptr Kirílych, lt’s go and hav a smok,” h said.
Pirr was agitatd and undcidd. Natásha’s unwontdly brilliant ys,
continually glancing at him with a mor than cordial look, had rducd
him to this condition.
“No, I think I’ll go hom.”
“Hom? Why, you mant to spnd th vning with us.... You don’t
oftn com nowadays as it is, and this girl of min,” said th count
good-naturdly, pointing to Natásha, “only brightns up whn you’r
hr.”
“Ys, I had forgottn... I rally must go hom... businss...” said
Pirr hurridly.
“Wll, thn, au rvoir!” said th count, and wnt out of th room.
“Why ar you going? Why ar you upst?” askd Natásha, and sh lookd
challngingly into Pirr’s ys.
“Bcaus I lov you!” was what h wantd to say, but h did not say it,
and only blushd till th tars cam, and lowrd his ys.
“Bcaus it is bttr for m to com lss oftn... bcaus... No, simply
I hav businss....”
“Why? No, tll m!” Natásha bgan rsolutly and suddnly stoppd.
Thy lookd at ach othr with dismayd and mbarrassd facs. H trid
to smil but could not: his smil xprssd suffring, and h silntly
kissd hr hand and wnt out.
Pirr mad up his mind not to go to th Rostóvs’ any mor.
CHAPTR XXI
Aftr th dfinit rfusal h had rcivd, Ptya wnt to his room
and thr lockd himslf in and wpt bittrly. Whn h cam in to ta,
silnt, moros, and with tar-staind fac, vrybody prtndd not to
notic anything.
Nxt day th mpror arrivd in Moscow, and svral of th Rostóvs’
domstic srfs bggd prmission to go to hav a look at him. That
morning Ptya was a long tim drssing and arranging his hair and
collar to look lik a grown-up man. H frownd bfor his looking glass,
gsticulatd, shruggd his shouldrs, and finally, without saying a word
to anyon, took his cap and lft th hous by th back door, trying to
avoid notic. Ptya dcidd to go straight to whr th mpror was and
to xplain frankly to som gntlman-in-waiting (h imagind th mpror
to b always surroundd by gntlmn-in-waiting) that h, Count Rostóv,
in spit of his youth wishd to srv his country; that youth could b
no hindranc to loyalty, and that h was rady to... Whil
drssing, Ptya had prpard many fin things h mant to say to th
gntlman-in-waiting.
It was on th vry fact of bing so young that Ptya countd for succss
in raching th mpror—h vn thought how surprisd vryon would b
at his youthfulnss—and yt in th arrangmnt of his collar and hair
and by his sdat dlibrat walk h wishd to appar a grown-up man.
But th farthr h wnt and th mor his attntion was divrtd by th
vr-incrasing crowds moving toward th Krmlin, th lss h rmmbrd
to walk with th sdatnss and dlibration of a man. As h approachd
th Krmlin h vn bgan to avoid bing crushd and rsolutly stuck
out his lbows in a mnacing way. But within th Trinity Gatway h
was so prssd to th wall by popl who probably wr unawar of th
patriotic intntions with which h had com that in spit of all his
dtrmination h had to giv in, and stop whil carriags passd in,
rumbling bnath th archway. Bsid Ptya stood a pasant woman, a
footman, two tradsmn, and a dischargd soldir. Aftr standing som
tim in th gatway, Ptya trid to mov forward in front of th othrs
without waiting for all th carriags to pass, and h bgan rsolutly
working his way with his lbows, but th woman just in front of him, who
was th first against whom h dirctd his fforts, angrily shoutd at
him:
“What ar you shoving for, young lordling? Don’t you s w’r all
standing still? Thn why push?”
“Anybody can shov,” said th footman, and also bgan working his lbows
to such ffct that h pushd Ptya into a vry filthy cornr of th
gatway.
Ptya wipd his prspiring fac with his hands and pulld up th damp
collar which h had arrangd so wll at hom to sm lik a man’s.
H flt that h no longr lookd prsntabl, and fard that if h wr
now to approach th gntlmn-in-waiting in that plight h would not b
admittd to th mpror. But it was impossibl to smartn onslf up
or mov to anothr plac, bcaus of th crowd. On of th gnrals who
drov past was an acquaintanc of th Rostóvs’, and Ptya thought of
asking his hlp, but cam to th conclusion that that would not b a
manly thing to do. Whn th carriags had all passd in, th crowd,
carrying Ptya with it, stramd forward into th Krmlin Squar which
was alrady full of popl. Thr wr popl not only in th squar,
but vrywhr—on th slops and on th roofs. As soon as Ptya found
himslf in th squar h clarly hard th sound of blls and th joyous
voics of th crowd that filld th whol Krmlin.
For a whil th crowd was lss dns, but suddnly all hads wr bard,
and vryon rushd forward in on dirction. Ptya was bing prssd so
that h could scarcly brath, and vrybody shoutd, “Hurrah! hurrah!
hurrah!” Ptya stood on tipto and pushd and pinchd, but could s
nothing xcpt th popl about him.
All th facs bor th sam xprssion of xcitmnt and nthusiasm. A
tradsman’s wif standing bsid Ptya sobbd, and th tars ran down
hr chks.
“Fathr! Angl! Dar on!” sh kpt rpating, wiping away hr tars
with hr fingrs.
“Hurrah!” was hard on all sids.
For a momnt th crowd stood still, but thn it mad anothr rush
forward.
Quit bsid himslf, Ptya, clinching his tth and rolling his ys
frociously, pushd forward, lbowing his way and shouting “hurrah!” as
if h wr prpard that instant to kill himslf and vryon ls, but
on both sids of him othr popl with similarly frocious facs pushd
forward and vrybody shoutd “hurrah!”
“So this is what th mpror is!” thought Ptya. “No, I can’t ptition
him myslf—that would b too bold.” But in spit of this h continud
to struggl dspratly forward, and from btwn th backs of thos
in front h caught glimpss of an opn spac with a strip of rd cloth
sprad out on it; but just thn th crowd swayd back—th polic
in front wr pushing back thos who had prssd too clos to th
procssion: th mpror was passing from th palac to th Cathdral of
th Assumption—and Ptya unxpctdly rcivd such a blow on his sid
and ribs and was squzd so hard that suddnly vrything grw dim
bfor his ys and h lost consciousnss. Whn h cam to himslf, a
man of clrical apparanc with a tuft of gray hair at th back of
his had and waring a shabby blu cassock—probably a church clrk and
chantr—was holding him undr th arm with on hand whil warding off
th prssur of th crowd with th othr.
“You’v crushd th young gntlman!” said th clrk. “What ar you up
to? Gntly!... Thy’v crushd him, crushd him!”
Th mpror ntrd th Cathdral of th Assumption. Th crowd sprad
out again mor vnly, and th clrk ld Ptya—pal and brathlss—to
th Tsar-cannon. Svral popl wr sorry for Ptya, and suddnly a
crowd turnd toward him and prssd round him. Thos who stood narst
him attndd to him, unbuttond his coat, satd him on th raisd
platform of th cannon, and rproachd thos othrs (whovr thy might
b) who had crushd him.
“On might asily gt killd that way! What do thy man by it? Killing
popl! Poor dar, h’s as whit as a sht!”—various voics wr hard
saying.
Ptya soon cam to himslf, th color rturnd to his fac, th pain had
passd, and at th cost of that tmporary unplasantnss h had obtaind
a plac by th cannon from whr h hopd to s th mpror who
would b rturning that way. Ptya no longr thought of prsnting his
ptition. If h could only s th mpror h would b happy!
Whil th srvic was procding in th Cathdral of th Assumption—it
was a combind srvic of prayr on th occasion of th mpror’s
arrival and of thanksgiving for th conclusion of pac with th
Turks—th crowd outsid sprad out and hawkrs appard, slling kvas,
gingrbrad, and poppysd swts (of which Ptya was particularly
fond), and ordinary convrsation could again b hard. A tradsman’s
wif was showing a rnt in hr shawl and tlling how much th shawl had
cost; anothr was saying that all silk goods had now got dar. Th clrk
who had rscud Ptya was talking to a functionary about th prists who
wr officiating that day with th bishop. Th clrk svral tims usd
th word “plnary” (of th srvic), a word Ptya did not undrstand.
Two young citizns wr joking with som srf girls who wr cracking
nuts. All ths convrsations, spcially th joking with th girls,
wr such as might hav had a particular charm for Ptya at his ag, but
thy did not intrst him now. H sat on his lvation—th pdstal of
th cannon—still agitatd as bfor by th thought of th mpror and by
his lov for him. Th fling of pain and far h had xprincd whn
h was bing crushd, togthr with that of raptur, still furthr
intnsifid his sns of th importanc of th occasion.
Suddnly th sound of a firing of cannon was hard from th mbankmnt,
to clbrat th signing of pac with th Turks, and th crowd rushd
imptuously toward th mbankmnt to watch th firing. Ptya too would
hav run thr, but th clrk who had takn th young gntlman undr
his protction stoppd him. Th firing was still procding whn
officrs, gnrals, and gntlmn-in-waiting cam running out of th
cathdral, and aftr thm othrs in a mor lisurly mannr: caps wr
again raisd, and thos who had run to look at th cannon ran back
again. At last four mn in uniforms and sashs mrgd from th
cathdral doors. “Hurrah! hurrah!” shoutd th crowd again.
“Which is h? Which?” askd Ptya in a tarful voic, of thos around
him, but no on answrd him, vrybody was too xcitd; and Ptya,
fixing on on of thos four mn, whom h could not clarly s for th
tars of joy that filld his ys, concntratd all his nthusiasm
on him—though it happnd not to b th mpror—frantically shoutd
“Hurrah!” and rsolvd that tomorrow, com what might, h would join th
army.
Th crowd ran aftr th mpror, followd him to th palac, and bgan
to disprs. It was alrady lat, and Ptya had not atn anything and
was drnchd with prspiration, yt h did not go hom but stood with
that diminishing, but still considrabl, crowd bfor th palac whil
th mpror dind—looking in at th palac windows, xpcting h knw
not what, and nvying alik th notabls h saw arriving at th ntranc
to din with th mpror and th court footmn who srvd at tabl,
glimpss of whom could b sn through th windows.
Whil th mpror was dining, Valúv, looking out of th window, said:
“Th popl ar still hoping to s Your Majsty again.”
Th dinnr was narly ovr, and th mpror, munching a biscuit, ros
and wnt out onto th balcony. Th popl, with Ptya among thm, rushd
toward th balcony.
“Angl! Dar on! Hurrah! Fathr!...” crid th crowd, and Ptya with
it, and again th womn and mn of wakr mold, Ptya among thm, wpt
with joy.
A largish pic of th biscuit th mpror was holding in his hand brok
off, fll on th balcony parapt, and thn to th ground. A coachman in
a jrkin, who stood narst, sprang forward and snatchd it up. Svral
popl in th crowd rushd at th coachman. Sing this th mpror had
a platful of biscuits brought him and bgan throwing thm down from
th balcony. Ptya’s ys grw bloodshot, and still mor xcitd by th
dangr of bing crushd, h rushd at th biscuits. H did not know why,
but h had to hav a biscuit from th Tsar’s hand and h flt that h
must not giv way. H sprang forward and upst an old woman who was
catching at a biscuit; th old woman did not considr hrslf dfatd
though sh was lying on th ground—sh grabbd at som biscuits but
hr hand did not rach thm. Ptya pushd hr hand away with his kn,
sizd a biscuit, and as if faring to b too lat, again shoutd
“Hurrah!” with a voic alrady hoars.
Th mpror wnt in, and aftr that th gratr part of th crowd bgan
to disprs.
“Thr! I said if only w waitd—and so it was!” was bing joyfully said
by various popl.
Happy as Ptya was, h flt sad at having to go hom knowing that all
th njoymnt of that day was ovr. H did not go straight hom from
th Krmlin, but calld on his frind Obolnski, who was fiftn and was
also ntring th rgimnt. On rturning hom Ptya announcd rsolutly
and firmly that if h was not allowd to ntr th srvic h would
run away. And nxt day, Count Ilyá Rostóv—though h had not yt quit
yildd—wnt to inquir how h could arrang for Ptya to srv whr
thr would b last dangr.
CHAPTR XXII
Two days latr, on th fiftnth of July, an immns numbr of carriags
wr standing outsid th Slobóda Palac.
Th grat halls wr full. In th first wr th nobility and gntry in
thir uniforms, in th scond bardd mrchants in full-skirtd coats
of blu cloth and waring mdals. In th noblmn’s hall thr was
an incssant movmnt and buzz of voics. Th chif magnats sat on
high-backd chairs at a larg tabl undr th portrait of th mpror,
but most of th gntry wr strolling about th room.
All ths nobls, whom Pirr mt vry day at th Club or in thir own
houss, wr in uniform—som in that of Cathrin’s day, othrs in that
of mpror Paul, othrs again in th nw uniforms of Alxandr’s tim or
th ordinary uniform of th nobility, and th gnral charactristic
of bing in uniform impartd somthing strang and fantastic to ths
divrs and familiar prsonalitis, both old and young. Th old mn,
dim-yd, toothlss, bald, sallow, and bloatd, or gaunt and wrinkld,
wr spcially striking. For th most part thy sat quitly in thir
placs and wr silnt, or, if thy walkd about and talkd, attachd
thmslvs to somon youngr. On all ths facs, as on th facs
of th crowd Ptya had sn in th Squar, thr was a striking
contradiction: th gnral xpctation of a solmn vnt, and at th
sam tim th vryday intrsts in a boston card party, Ptr th cook,
Zinaída Dmítrivna’s halth, and so on.
Pirr was thr too, buttond up sinc arly morning in a noblman’s
uniform that had bcom too tight for him. H was agitatd;
this xtraordinary gathring not only of nobls but also of th
mrchant-class—ls tats gnraux (Stats-Gnral)—vokd in him a whol
sris of idas h had long laid asid but which wr dply gravn in
his soul: thoughts of th Contrat Social and th Frnch Rvolution. Th
words that had struck him in th mpror’s appal—that th sovrign was
coming to th capital for consultation with his popl—strngthnd this
ida. And imagining that in this dirction somthing important which
h had long awaitd was drawing nar, h strolld about watching and
listning to convrsations, but nowhr finding any confirmation of th
idas that occupid him.
Th mpror’s manifsto was rad, voking nthusiasm, and thn all movd
about discussing it. Bsids th ordinary topics of convrsation, Pirr
hard qustions of whr th marshals of th nobility wr to stand whn
th mpror ntrd, whn a ball should b givn in th mpror’s
honor, whthr thy should group thmslvs by districts or by whol
provincs... and so on; but as soon as th war was touchd on, or
what th nobility had bn convnd for, th talk bcam undcidd and
indfinit. Thn all prfrrd listning to spaking.
A middl-agd man, handsom and viril, in th uniform of a rtird
naval officr, was spaking in on of th rooms, and a small crowd was
prssing round him. Pirr wnt up to th circl that had formd round
th spakr and listnd. Count Ilyá Rostóv, in a military uniform of
Cathrin’s tim, was sauntring with a plasant smil among th crowd,
with all of whom h was acquaintd. H too approachd that group and
listnd with a kindly smil and nods of approval, as h always did,
to what th spakr was saying. Th rtird naval man was spaking vry
boldly, as was vidnt from th xprssion on th facs of th listnrs
and from th fact that som popl Pirr knw as th mkst and
quitst of mn walkd away disapprovingly or xprssd disagrmnt
with him. Pirr pushd his way into th middl of th group, listnd,
and convincd himslf that th man was indd a libral, but of viws
quit diffrnt from his own. Th naval officr spok in a particularly
sonorous, musical, and aristocratic bariton voic, plasantly
swallowing his r’s and gnrally slurring his consonants: th voic of
a man calling out to his srvant, “Hah! Bwing m my pip!” It was
indicativ of dissipation and th xrcis of authority.
“What if th Smolnsk popl hav offahd to wais militia for th
mpwah? Ah w to tak Smolnsk as our patt’n? If th nobl awistocwacy
of th pwovinc of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our
sov’wign th mpwah in othr ways. Hav w fo’gottn th waising of
th militia in th yah ‘svn? All that did was to nwich th pwists’
sons and thivs and wobbahs....”
Count Ilyá Rostóv smild blandly and noddd approval.
“And was our militia of any us to th mpia? Not at all! It only wuind
our farming! Bttah hav anothr conscwiption... o’ ou’ mn will wtu’n
nithah soldirs no’ pasants, and w’ll gt only dpwavity fwom thm.
Th nobility don’t gwudg thah livs—vwy on of us will go and bwing
in mor wcwuits, and th sov’wign” (that was th way h rfrrd to
th mpror) “nd only say th word and w’ll all di fo’ him!” addd
th orator with animation.
Count Rostóv’s mouth watrd with plasur and h nudgd Pirr, but
Pirr wantd to spak himslf. H pushd forward, fling stirrd,
but not yt sur what stirrd him or what h would say. Scarcly had h
opnd his mouth whn on of th snators, a man without a tooth in his
had, with a shrwd though angry xprssion, standing nar th first
spakr, intrruptd him. vidntly accustomd to managing dbats and
to maintaining an argumnt, h bgan in low but distinct tons:
“I imagin, sir,” said h, mumbling with his toothlss mouth, “that w
hav bn summond hr not to discuss whthr it’s bst for th mpir
at th prsnt momnt to adopt conscription or to call out th militia.
W hav bn summond to rply to th appal with which our sovrign
th mpror has honord us. But to judg what is bst—conscription or
th militia—w can lav to th suprm authority....”
Pirr suddnly saw an outlt for his xcitmnt. H hardnd his hart
against th snator who was introducing this st and narrow attitud
into th dlibrations of th nobility. Pirr stppd forward and
intrruptd him. H himslf did not yt know what h would say, but h
bgan to spak agrly, occasionally lapsing into Frnch or xprssing
himslf in bookish Russian.
“xcus m, your xcllncy,” h bgan. (H was wll acquaintd with
th snator, but thought it ncssary on this occasion to addrss him
formally.) “Though I don’t agr with th gntlman...” (h hsitatd:
h wishd to say, “Mon très honorabl propinant”—“My vry honorabl
opponnt”) “with th gntlman... whom I hav not th honor of knowing,
I suppos that th nobility hav bn summond not mrly to xprss
thir sympathy and nthusiasm but also to considr th mans by which
w can assist our Fathrland! I imagin,” h wnt on, warming to his
subjct, “that th mpror himslf would not b satisfid to find in us
mrly ownrs of srfs whom w ar willing to dvot to his srvic, and
chair à canon * w ar rady to mak of ourslvs—and not to obtain from
us any co-co-counsl.”
    * “Food for cannon.”
Many prsons withdrw from th circl, noticing th snator’s sarcastic
smil and th frdom of Pirr’s rmarks. Only Count Rostóv was plasd
with thm as h had bn plasd with thos of th naval officr, th
snator, and in gnral with whatvr spch h had last hard.
“I think that bfor discussing ths qustions,” Pirr continud, “w
should ask th mpror—most rspctfully ask His Majsty—to lt us know
th numbr of our troops and th position in which our army and our
forcs now ar, and thn...”
But scarcly had Pirr uttrd ths words bfor h was attackd from
thr sids. Th most vigorous attack cam from an old acquaintanc,
a boston playr who had always bn wll disposd toward him, Stpán
Stpánovich Adráksin. Adráksin was in uniform, and whthr as a rsult
of th uniform or from som othr caus Pirr saw bfor him quit a
diffrnt man. With a suddn xprssion of malvolnc on his agd fac,
Adráksin shoutd at Pirr:
“In th first plac, I tll you w hav no right to qustion th mpror
about that, and scondly, if th Russian nobility had that right, th
mpror could not answr such a qustion. Th troops ar movd
according to th nmy’s movmnts and th numbr of mn incrass and
dcrass....”
Anothr voic, that of a noblman of mdium hight and about forty yars
of ag, whom Pirr had formrly mt at th gypsis’ and knw as a bad
cardplayr, and who, also transformd by his uniform, cam up to Pirr,
intrruptd Adráksin.
“Ys, and this is not a tim for discussing,” h continud, “but for
acting: thr is war in Russia! Th nmy is advancing to dstroy
Russia, to dscrat th tombs of our fathrs, to carry off our wivs
and childrn.” Th noblman smot his brast. “W will all aris,
vryon of us will go, for our fathr th Tsar!” h shoutd, rolling
his bloodshot ys. Svral approving voics wr hard in th crowd.
“W ar Russians and will not grudg our blood in dfns of our faith,
th thron, and th Fathrland! W must cas raving if w ar sons of
our Fathrland! W will show urop how Russia riss to th dfns of
Russia!”
Pirr wishd to rply, but could not gt in a word. H flt that his
words, apart from what maning thy convyd, wr lss audibl than th
sound of his opponnt’s voic.
Count Rostóv at th back of th crowd was xprssing approval; svral
prsons, briskly turning a shouldr to th orator at th nd of a
phras, said:
“That’s right, quit right! Just so!”
Pirr wishd to say that h was rady to sacrific his mony, his
srfs, or himslf, only on ought to know th stat of affairs in
ordr to b abl to improv it, but h was unabl to spak. Many voics
shoutd and talkd at th sam tim, so that Count Rostóv had not tim
to signify his approval of thm all, and th group incrasd, disprsd,
r-formd, and thn movd with a hum of talk into th largst hall and
to th big tabl. Not only was Pirr’s attmpt to spak unsuccssful,
but h was rudly intrruptd, pushd asid, and popl turnd away
from him as from a common nmy. This happnd not bcaus thy wr
displasd by th substanc of his spch, which had vn bn forgottn
aftr th many subsqunt spchs, but to animat it th crowd ndd a
tangibl objct to lov and a tangibl objct to hat. Pirr bcam th
lattr. Many othr orators spok aftr th xcitd noblman, and all in
th sam ton. Many spok loquntly and with originality.
Glínka, th ditor of th Russian Mssngr, who was rcognizd (cris
of “author! author!” wr hard in th crowd), said that “hll must b
rpulsd by hll,” and that h had sn a child smiling at lightning
flashs and thundrclaps, but “w will not b that child.”
“Ys, ys, at thundrclaps!” was rpatd approvingly in th back rows
of th crowd.
Th crowd drw up to th larg tabl, at which sat gray-haird or bald
svnty-yar-old magnats, uniformd and bsashd almost all of whom
Pirr had sn in thir own homs with thir buffoons, or playing
boston at th clubs. With an incssant hum of voics th crowd advancd
to th tabl. Prssd by th throng against th high backs of th
chairs, th orators spok on aftr anothr and somtims two togthr.
Thos standing bhind noticd what a spakr omittd to say and hastnd
to supply it. Othrs in that hat and crush rackd thir brains to find
som thought and hastnd to uttr it. Th old magnats, whom Pirr
knw, sat and turnd to look first at on and thn at anothr, and thir
facs for th most part only xprssd th fact that thy found it vry
hot. Pirr, howvr, flt xcitd, and th gnral dsir to show that
thy wr rady to go to all lngths—which found xprssion in th tons
and looks mor than in th substanc of th spchs—infctd him too.
H did not rnounc his opinions, but flt himslf in som way to blam
and wishd to justify himslf.
“I only said that it would b mor to th purpos to mak sacrifics
whn w know what is ndd!” said h, trying to b hard abov th
othr voics.
On of th old mn narst to him lookd round, but his attntion was
immdiatly divrtd by an xclamation at th othr sid of th tabl.
“Ys, Moscow will b surrndrd! Sh will b our xpiation!” shoutd
on man.
“H is th nmy of mankind!” crid anothr. “Allow m to spak....”
“Gntlmn, you ar crushing m!...”
CHAPTR XXIII
At that momnt Count Rostopchín with his protruding chin and alrt ys,
waring th uniform of a gnral with sash ovr his shouldr, ntrd
th room, stpping briskly to th front of th crowd of gntry.
“Our sovrign th mpror will b hr in a momnt,” said Rostopchín.
“I am straight from th palac. Sing th position w ar in, I think
thr is littl nd for discussion. Th mpror has dignd to summon
us and th mrchants. Millions will pour forth from thr”—h pointd
to th mrchants’ hall—“but our businss is to supply mn and not spar
ourslvs.... That is th last w can do!”
A confrnc took plac confind to th magnats sitting at th tabl.
Th whol consultation passd mor than quitly. Aftr all th prcding
nois th sound of thir old voics saying on aftr anothr, “I
agr,” or for varity, “I too am of that opinion,” and so on had vn a
mournful ffct.
Th scrtary was told to writ down th rsolution of th Moscow
nobility and gntry, that thy would furnish tn mn, fully quippd,
out of vry thousand srfs, as th Smolnsk gntry had don. Thir
chairs mad a scraping nois as th gntlmn who had confrrd ros
with apparnt rlif, and bgan walking up and down, arm in arm, to
strtch thir lgs and convrs in coupls.
“Th mpror! Th mpror!” a suddn cry rsoundd through th halls and
th whol throng hurrid to th ntranc.
Th mpror ntrd th hall through a broad path btwn two lins of
nobls. vry fac xprssd rspctful, aw-struck curiosity. Pirr
stood rathr far off and could not har all that th mpror said. From
what h did har h undrstood that th mpror spok of th dangr
thratning th mpir and of th hops h placd on th Moscow
nobility. H was answrd by a voic which informd him of th
rsolution just arrivd at.
“Gntlmn!” said th mpror with a quivring voic.
Thr was a rustling among th crowd and it again subsidd, so that
Pirr distinctly hard th plasantly human voic of th mpror saying
with motion:
“I nvr doubtd th dvotion of th Russian nobls, but today it has
surpassd my xpctations. I thank you in th nam of th Fathrland!
Gntlmn, lt us act! Tim is most prcious....”
Th mpror casd spaking, th crowd bgan prssing round him, and
rapturous xclamations wr hard from all sids.
“Ys, most prcious... a royal word,” said Count Rostóv, with a sob. H
stood at th back, and, though h had hard hardly anything, undrstood
vrything in his own way.
From th hall of th nobility th mpror wnt to that of th mrchants.
Thr h rmaind about tn minuts. Pirr was among thos who saw him
com out from th mrchants’ hall with tars of motion in his ys.
As bcam known latr, h had scarcly bgun to addrss th mrchants
bfor tars gushd from his ys and h concludd in a trmbling
voic. Whn Pirr saw th mpror h was coming out accompanid by two
mrchants, on of whom Pirr knw, a fat otkupshchík. Th othr was
th mayor, a man with a thin sallow fac and narrow bard. Both wr
wping. Tars filld th thin man’s ys, and th fat otkupshchík
sobbd outright lik a child and kpt rpating:
“Our livs and proprty—tak thm, Your Majsty!”
Pirr’s on fling at th momnt was a dsir to show that h was
rady to go all lngths and was prpard to sacrific vrything. H now
flt ashamd of his spch with its constitutional tndncy and sought
an opportunity of ffacing it. Having hard that Count Mamónov was
furnishing a rgimnt, Bzúkhov at onc informd Rostopchín that h
would giv a thousand mn and thir maintnanc.
Old Rostóv could not tll his wif of what had passd without tars, and
at onc consntd to Ptya’s rqust and wnt himslf to ntr his nam.
Nxt day th mpror lft Moscow. Th assmbld nobls all took off
thir uniforms and sttld down again in thir homs and clubs, and not
without som groans gav ordrs to thir stwards about th nrollmnt,
fling amazd thmslvs at what thy had don.
BOOK TN: 1812
CHAPTR I
Napolon bgan th war with Russia bcaus h could not rsist going
to Drsdn, could not hlp having his had turnd by th homag h
rcivd, could not hlp donning a Polish uniform and yilding to th
stimulating influnc of a Jun morning, and could not rfrain from
bursts of angr in th prsnc of Kurákin and thn of Balashëv.
Alxandr rfusd ngotiations bcaus h flt himslf to b prsonally
insultd. Barclay d Tolly trid to command th army in th bst
way, bcaus h wishd to fulfill his duty and arn fam as a grat
commandr. Rostóv chargd th Frnch bcaus h could not rstrain
his wish for a gallop across a lvl fild; and in th sam way th
innumrabl popl who took part in th war actd in accord with thir
prsonal charactristics, habits, circumstancs, and aims. Thy wr
movd by far or vanity, rjoicd or wr indignant, rasond, imagining
that thy knw what thy wr doing and did it of thir own fr will,
but thy all wr involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work
concald from thm but comprhnsibl to us. Such is th invitabl
fat of mn of action, and th highr thy stand in th social hirarchy
th lss ar thy fr.
Th actors of 1812 hav long sinc lft th stag, thir prsonal
intrsts hav vanishd laving no trac, and nothing rmains of that
tim but its historic rsults.
Providnc complld all ths mn, striving to attain prsonal aims, to
furthr th accomplishmnt of a stupndous rsult no on of thm at all
xpctd—nithr Napolon, nor Alxandr, nor still lss any of thos
who did th actual fighting.
Th caus of th dstruction of th Frnch army in 1812 is clar to us
now. No on will dny that that caus was, on th on hand, its advanc
into th hart of Russia lat in th sason without any prparation for
a wintr campaign and, on th othr, th charactr givn to th war
by th burning of Russian towns and th hatrd of th fo this arousd
among th Russian popl. But no on at th tim forsaw (what now sms
so vidnt) that this was th only way an army of ight hundrd thousand
mn—th bst in th world and ld by th bst gnral—could b dstroyd
in conflict with a raw army of half its numrical strngth, and ld by
inxprincd commandrs as th Russian army was. Not only did no on
s this, but on th Russian sid vry ffort was mad to hindr th
only thing that could sav Russia, whil on th Frnch sid, dspit
Napolon’s xprinc and so-calld military gnius, vry ffort was
dirctd to pushing on to Moscow at th nd of th summr, that is, to
doing th vry thing that was bound to lad to dstruction.
In historical works on th yar 1812 Frnch writrs ar vry fond of
saying that Napolon flt th dangr of xtnding his lin, that h
sought a battl and that his marshals advisd him to stop at Smolnsk,
and of making similar statmnts to show that th dangr of th campaign
was vn thn undrstood. Russian authors ar still fondr of tlling
us that from th commncmnt of th campaign a Scythian war plan was
adoptd to lur Napolon into th dpths of Russia, and this plan som
of thm attribut to Pful, othrs to a crtain Frnchman, othrs to
Toll, and othrs again to Alxandr himslf—pointing to nots, projcts,
and lttrs which contain hints of such a lin of action. But all ths
hints at what happnd, both from th Frnch sid and th Russian, ar
advancd only bcaus thy fit in with th vnt. Had that vnt not
occurrd ths hints would hav bn forgottn, as w hav forgottn th
thousands and millions of hints and xpctations to th contrary
which wr currnt thn but hav now bn forgottn bcaus th vnt
falsifid thm. Thr ar always so many conjcturs as to th issu of
any vnt that howvr it may nd thr will always b popl to say:
“I said thn that it would b so,” quit forgtting that amid thir
innumrabl conjcturs many wr to quit th contrary ffct.
Conjcturs as to Napolon’s awarnss of th dangr of xtnding his
lin, and (on th Russian sid) as to luring th nmy into th dpths
of Russia, ar vidntly of that kind, and only by much straining can
historians attribut such concptions to Napolon and his marshals,
or such plans to th Russian commandrs. All th facts ar in flat
contradiction to such conjcturs. During th whol priod of th war
not only was thr no wish on th Russian sid to draw th Frnch
into th hart of th country, but from thir first ntry into Russia
vrything was don to stop thm. And not only was Napolon not afraid
to xtnd his lin, but h wlcomd vry stp forward as a triumph and
did not sk battl as agrly as in formr campaigns, but vry lazily.
At th vry bginning of th war our armis wr dividd, and our sol
aim was to unit thm, though uniting th armis was no advantag if w
mant to rtir and lur th nmy into th dpths of th country. Our
mpror joind th army to ncourag it to dfnd vry inch of Russian
soil and not to rtrat. Th normous Drissa camp was formd on Pful’s
plan, and thr was no intntion of rtiring farthr. Th mpror
rproachd th commandrs in chif for vry stp thy rtird. H could
not bar th ida of ltting th nmy vn rach Smolnsk, still lss
could h contmplat th burning of Moscow, and whn our armis did
unit h was displasd that Smolnsk was abandond and burnd without a
gnral ngagmnt having bn fought undr its walls.
So thought th mpror, and th Russian commandrs and popl wr still
mor provokd at th thought that our forcs wr rtrating into th
dpths of th country.
Napolon having cut our armis apart advancd far into th country and
missd svral chancs of forcing an ngagmnt. In August h was at
Smolnsk and thought only of how to advanc farthr, though as w now
s that advanc was vidntly ruinous to him.
Th facts clarly show that Napolon did not fors th dangr of th
advanc on Moscow, nor did Alxandr and th Russian commandrs thn
think of luring Napolon on, but quit th contrary. Th luring of
Napolon into th dpths of th country was not th rsult of any plan,
for no on blivd it to b possibl; it rsultd from a most complx
intrplay of intrigus, aims, and wishs among thos who took part in
th war and had no prcption whatvr of th invitabl, or of th on
way of saving Russia. vrything cam about fortuitously. Th armis
wr dividd at th commncmnt of th campaign. W trid to unit
thm, with th vidnt intntion of giving battl and chcking th
nmy’s advanc, and by this ffort to unit thm whil avoiding battl
with a much strongr nmy, and ncssarily withdrawing th armis at
an acut angl—w ld th Frnch on to Smolnsk. But w withdrw at an
acut angl not only bcaus th Frnch advancd btwn our two armis;
th angl bcam still mor acut and w withdrw still farthr, bcaus
Barclay d Tolly was an unpopular forignr dislikd by Bagratión (who
would com undr his command), and Bagratión—bing in command of th
scond army—trid to postpon joining up and coming undr Barclay’s
command as long as h could. Bagratión was slow in ffcting th
junction—though that was th chif aim of all at hadquartrs—bcaus,
as h allgd, h xposd his army to dangr on this march, and it was
bst for him to rtir mor to th lft and mor to th south, worrying
th nmy from flank and rar and scuring from th Ukrain rcruits for
his army; and it looks as if h plannd this in ordr not to com undr
th command of th dtstd forignr Barclay, whos rank was infrior
to his own.
Th mpror was with th army to ncourag it, but his prsnc and
ignoranc of what stps to tak, and th normous numbr of advisrs and
plans, dstroyd th first army’s nrgy and it rtird.
Th intntion was to mak a stand at th Drissa camp, but Paulucci,
aiming at bcoming commandr in chif, unxpctdly mployd his nrgy
to influnc Alxandr, and Pful’s whol plan was abandond and th
command ntrustd to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspir confidnc
his powr was limitd. Th armis wr dividd, thr was no unity of
command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division,
and th unpopularity of th forign commandr in chif, thr rsultd
on th on hand indcision and th avoidanc of a battl (which w could
not hav rfraind from had th armis bn unitd and had somon ls,
instad of Barclay, bn in command) and on th othr an vr-incrasing
indignation against th forignrs and an incras in patriotic zal.
At last th mpror lft th army, and as th most convnint and indd
th only prtxt for his dpartur it was dcidd that it was ncssary
for him to inspir th popl in th capitals and arous th nation in
gnral to a patriotic war. And by this visit of th mpror to Moscow
th strngth of th Russian army was trbld.
H lft in ordr not to obstruct th commandr in chif’s undividd
control of th army, and hoping that mor dcisiv action would thn
b takn, but th command of th armis bcam still mor confusd and
nfbld. Bnnigsn, th Tsarvich, and a swarm of adjutants gnral
rmaind with th army to kp th commandr in chif undr obsrvation
and arous his nrgy, and Barclay, fling lss fr than vr undr
th obsrvation of all ths “ys of th mpror,” bcam still mor
cautious of undrtaking any dcisiv action and avoidd giving battl.
Barclay stood for caution. Th Tsarvich hintd at trachry and
dmandd a gnral ngagmnt. Lubomírski, Bronnítski, Wlocki, and th
othrs of that group stirrd up so much troubl that Barclay, undr
prtxt of snding paprs to th mpror, dispatchd ths Polish
adjutants gnral to Ptrsburg and plungd into an opn struggl with
Bnnigsn and th Tsarvich.
At Smolnsk th armis at last runitd, much as Bagratión dislikd it.
Bagratión drov up in a carriag to th hous occupid by Barclay.
Barclay donnd his sash and cam out to mt and rport to his snior
officr Bagratión.
Dspit his sniority in rank Bagratión, in this contst of magnanimity,
took his ordrs from Barclay, but, having submittd, agrd with him
lss than vr. By th mpror’s ordrs Bagratión rportd dirct to
him. H wrot to Arakchv, th mpror’s confidant: “It must b as
my sovrign plass, but I cannot work with th Ministr (maning
Barclay). For God’s sak snd m somwhr ls if only in command of
a rgimnt. I cannot stand it hr. Hadquartrs ar so full of Grmans
that a Russian cannot xist and thr is no sns in anything. I thought
I was rally srving my sovrign and th Fathrland, but it turns out
that I am srving Barclay. I confss I do not want to.”
Th swarm of Bronnítskis and Wintzingrods and thir lik still furthr
mbittrd th rlations btwn th commandrs in chif, and vn
lss unity rsultd. Prparations wr mad to fight th Frnch bfor
Smolnsk. A gnral was snt to survy th position. This gnral,
hating Barclay, rod to visit a frind of his own, a corps commandr,
and, having spnt th day with him, rturnd to Barclay and condmnd,
as unsuitabl from vry point of viw, th battlground h had not
sn.
Whil disputs and intrigus wr going on about th futur fild of
battl, and whil w wr looking for th Frnch—having lost touch with
thm—th Frnch stumbld upon Nvrovski’s division and rachd th
walls of Smolnsk.
It was ncssary to fight an unxpctd battl at Smolnsk to sav our
lins of communication. Th battl was fought and thousands wr killd
on both sids.
Smolnsk was abandond contrary to th wishs of th mpror and of th
whol popl. But Smolnsk was burnd by its own inhabitants who had
bn misld by thir govrnor. And ths ruind inhabitants, stting
an xampl to othr Russians, wnt to Moscow thinking only of thir own
losss but kindling hatrd of th fo. Napolon advancd farthr and w
rtird, thus arriving at th vry rsult which causd his dstruction.
CHAPTR II
Th day aftr his son had lft, Princ Nicholas snt for Princss Mary
to com to his study.
“Wll? Ar you satisfid now?” said h. “You’v mad m quarrl with my
son! Satisfid, ar you? That’s all you wantd! Satisfid?... It hurts
m, it hurts. I’m old and wak and this is what you wantd. Wll thn,
gloat ovr it! Gloat ovr it!”
Aftr that Princss Mary did not s hr fathr for a whol wk. H was
ill and did not lav his study.
Princss Mary noticd to hr surpris that during this illnss th
old princ not only xcludd hr from his room, but did not admit
Madmoisll Bourinn ithr. Tíkhon alon attndd him.
At th nd of th wk th princ rappard and rsumd his formr way
of lif, dvoting himslf with spcial activity to building oprations
and th arrangmnt of th gardns and compltly braking off his
rlations with Madmoisll Bourinn. His looks and cold ton to his
daughtr smd to say: “Thr, you s? You plottd against m, you
lid to Princ Andrw about my rlations with that Frnchwoman and mad
m quarrl with him, but you s I nd nithr hr nor you!”
Princss Mary spnt half of vry day with littl Nicholas, watching
his lssons, taching him Russian and music hrslf, and talking to
Dssalls; th rst of th day sh spnt ovr hr books, with hr old
nurs, or with “God’s folk” who somtims cam by th back door to s
hr.
Of th war Princss Mary thought as womn do think about wars. Sh
fard for hr brothr who was in it, was horrifid by and amazd at
th strang crulty that impls mn to kill on anothr, but sh did not
undrstand th significanc of this war, which smd to hr lik all
prvious wars. Sh did not raliz th significanc of this war, though
Dssalls with whom sh constantly convrsd was passionatly intrstd
in its progrss and trid to xplain his own concption of it to hr,
and though th “God’s folk” who cam to s hr rportd, in thir own
way, th rumors currnt among th popl of an invasion by Antichrist,
and though Juli (now Princss Drubtskáya), who had rsumd
corrspondnc with hr, wrot patriotic lttrs from Moscow.
“I writ you in Russian, my good frind,” wrot Juli in hr Frnchifid
Russian, “bcaus I hav a dtstation for all th Frnch, and th

Moscow ar latd by nthusiasm for our adord mpror.
“My poor husband is nduring pains and hungr in Jwish tavrns, but th

“You hard probably of th hroic xploit of Ravski, mbracing his two
sons and saying: ‘I will prish with thm but w will not b shakn!’
And truly though th nmy was twic strongr than w, w wr

princsss Alin and Sophi sit whol days with m, and w, unhappy
widows of liv mn, mak bautiful convrsations ovr our charpi, only
you, my frind, ar missing...” and so on.
Th chif rason Princss Mary did not raliz th full significanc of
this war was that th old princ nvr spok of it, did not rcogniz
it, and laughd at Dssalls whn h mntiond it at dinnr.
Th princ’s ton was so calm and confidnt that Princss Mary
unhsitatingly blivd him.
All that July th old princ was xcdingly activ and vn animatd.
H plannd anothr gardn and bgan a nw building for th domstic
srfs. Th only thing that mad Princss Mary anxious about him was that
h slpt vry littl and, instad of slping in his study as usual,
changd his slping plac vry day. On day h would ordr his camp
bd to b st up in th glass gallry, anothr day h rmaind on th
couch or on th loung chair in th drawing room and dozd thr without
undrssing, whil—instad of Madmoisll Bourinn—a srf boy rad to
him. Thn again h would spnd a night in th dining room.
On August 1, a scond lttr was rcivd from Princ Andrw. In his
first lttr which cam soon aftr h had lft hom, Princ Andrw had
dutifully askd his fathr’s forgivnss for what h had allowd himslf
to say and bggd to b rstord to his favor. To this lttr th old
princ had rplid affctionatly, and from that tim had kpt th
Frnchwoman at a distanc. Princ Andrw’s scond lttr, writtn nar
Vítbsk aftr th Frnch had occupid that town, gav a brif account of
th whol campaign, nclosd for thm a plan h had drawn and forcasts
as to th furthr progrss of th war. In this lttr Princ Andrw
pointd out to his fathr th dangr of staying at Bald Hills, so nar
th thatr of war and on th army’s dirct lin of march, and advisd
him to mov to Moscow.
At dinnr that day, on Dssalls’ mntioning that th Frnch wr said
to hav alrady ntrd Vítbsk, th old princ rmmbrd his son’s
lttr.
“Thr was a lttr from Princ Andrw today,” h said to Princss
Mary—“Havn’t you rad it?”
“No, Fathr,” sh rplid in a frightnd voic.
Sh could not hav rad th lttr as sh did not vn know it had
arrivd.
“H writs about this war,” said th princ, with th ironic smil that
had bcom habitual to him in spaking of th prsnt war.
“That must b vry intrsting,” said Dssalls. “Princ Andrw is in a
position to know...”
“Oh, vry intrsting!” said Madmoisll Bourinn.
“Go and gt it for m,” said th old princ to Madmoisll Bourinn.
“You know—undr th paprwight on th littl tabl.”
Madmoisll Bourinn jumpd up agrly.
“No, don’t!” h xclaimd with a frown. “You go, Michal Ivánovich.”
Michal Ivánovich ros and wnt to th study. But as soon as h had lft
th room th old princ, looking unasily round, thrw down his napkin
and wnt himslf.
“Thy can’t do anything... always mak som muddl,” h muttrd.
Whil h was away Princss Mary, Dssalls, Madmoisll Bourinn, and
vn littl Nicholas xchangd looks in silnc. Th old princ rturnd
with quick stps, accompanid by Michal Ivánovich, bringing th lttr
and a plan. Ths h put down bsid him—not ltting anyon rad thm at
dinnr.
On moving to th drawing room h handd th lttr to Princss Mary and,
sprading out bfor him th plan of th nw building and fixing his
ys upon it, told hr to rad th lttr aloud. Whn sh had don so
Princss Mary lookd inquiringly at hr fathr. H was xamining th
plan, vidntly ngrossd in his own idas.
“What do you think of it, Princ?” Dssalls vnturd to ask.
“I? I?...” said th princ as if unplasantly awaknd, and not taking
his ys from th plan of th building.
“Vry possibly th thatr of war will mov so nar to us that...”
“Ha ha ha! Th thatr of war!” said th princ. “I hav said and still
say that th thatr of war is Poland and th nmy will nvr gt
byond th Nimn.”
Dssalls lookd in amazmnt at th princ, who was talking of th
Nimn whn th nmy was alrady at th Dnipr, but Princss Mary,
forgtting th gographical position of th Nimn, thought that what
hr fathr was saying was corrct.
“Whn th snow mlts thy’ll sink in th Polish swamps. Only thy
could fail to s it,” th princ continud, vidntly thinking of th
campaign of 1807 which smd to him so rcnt. “Bnnigsn should hav
advancd into Prussia soonr, thn things would hav takn a diffrnt
turn...”
“But, Princ,” Dssalls bgan timidly, “th lttr mntions
Vítbsk....”
“Ah, th lttr? Ys...” rplid th princ pvishly. “Ys... ys...”
His fac suddnly took on a moros xprssion. H pausd. “Ys, h
writs that th Frnch wr batn at... at... what rivr is it?”
Dssalls droppd his ys.
“Th princ says nothing about that,” h rmarkd gntly.
“Dosn’t h? But I didn’t invnt it myslf.”
No on spok for a long tim.
“Ys... ys... Wll, Michal Ivánovich,” h suddnly wnt on, raising
his had and pointing to th plan of th building, “tll m how you man
to altr it....”
Michal Ivánovich wnt up to th plan, and th princ aftr spaking to
him about th building lookd angrily at Princss Mary and Dssalls and
wnt to his own room.
Princss Mary saw Dssalls’ mbarrassd and astonishd look fixd on
hr fathr, noticd his silnc, and was struck by th fact that hr
fathr had forgottn his son’s lttr on th drawing room tabl; but sh
was not only afraid to spak of it and ask Dssalls th rason of his
confusion and silnc, but was afraid vn to think about it.
In th vning Michal Ivánovich, snt by th princ, cam to Princss
Mary for Princ Andrw’s lttr which had bn forgottn in th drawing
room. Sh gav it to him and, unplasant as it was to hr to do so,
vnturd to ask him what hr fathr was doing.
“Always busy,” rplid Michal Ivánovich with a rspctfully ironic
smil which causd Princss Mary to turn pal. “H’s worrying vry much
about th nw building. H has bn rading a littl, but now”—Michal
Ivánovich wnt on, lowring his voic—“now h’s at his dsk, busy with
his will, I xpct.” (On of th princ’s favorit occupations of lat
had bn th prparation of som paprs h mant to lav at his dath
and which h calld his “will.”)
“And Alpátych is bing snt to Smolnsk?” askd Princss Mary.
“Oh, ys, h has bn waiting to start for som tim.”
CHAPTR III
Whn Michal Ivánovich rturnd to th study with th lttr, th old
princ, with spctacls on and a shad ovr his ys, was sitting at his
opn burau with scrnd candls, holding a papr in his outstrtchd
hand, and in a somwhat dramatic attitud was rading his manuscript—his
“Rmarks” as h trmd it—which was to b transmittd to th mpror
aftr his dath.
Whn Michal Ivánovich wnt in thr wr tars in th princ’s ys
vokd by th mmory of th tim whn th papr h was now rading had
bn writtn. H took th lttr from Michal Ivánovich’s hand, put it
in his pockt, foldd up his paprs, and calld in Alpátych who had long
bn waiting.
Th princ had a list of things to b bought in Smolnsk and, walking
up and down th room past Alpátych who stood by th door, h gav his
instructions.
“First, notpapr—do you har? ight quirs, lik this sampl,
gilt-dgd... it must b xactly lik th sampl. Varnish, saling wax,
as in Michal Ivánovich’s list.”
H pacd up and down for a whil and glancd at his nots.
“Thn hand to th govrnor in prson a lttr about th dd.”
Nxt, bolts for th doors of th nw building wr wantd and had to b
of a spcial shap th princ had himslf dsignd, and a lathr cas
had to b ordrd to kp th “will” in.
Th instructions to Alpátych took ovr two hours and still th princ
did not lt him go. H sat down, sank into thought, closd his ys, and
dozd off. Alpátych mad a slight movmnt.
“Wll, go, go! If anything mor is wantd I’ll snd aftr you.”
Alpátych wnt out. Th princ again wnt to his burau, glancd into it,
fingrd his paprs, closd th burau again, and sat down at th tabl
to writ to th govrnor.
It was alrady lat whn h ros aftr saling th lttr. H wishd
to slp, but h knw h would not b abl to and that most dprssing
thoughts cam to him in bd. So h calld Tíkhon and wnt through th
rooms with him to show him whr to st up th bd for that night.
H wnt about looking at vry cornr. vry plac smd
unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in th study.
That couch was dradful to him, probably bcaus of th opprssiv
thoughts h had had whn lying thr. It was unsatisfactory vrywhr,
but th cornr bhind th piano in th sitting room was bttr than
othr placs: h had nvr slpt thr yt.
With th hlp of a footman Tíkhon brought in th bdstad and bgan
putting it up.
“That’s not right! That’s not right!” crid th princ, and himslf
pushd it a fw inchs from th cornr and thn closr in again.
“Wll, at last I’v finishd, now I’ll rst,” thought th princ, and
lt Tíkhon undrss him.
Frowning with vxation at th ffort ncssary to divst himslf of his
coat and trousrs, th princ undrssd, sat down havily on th
bd, and appard to b mditating as h lookd contmptuously at his
withrd yllow lgs. H was not mditating, but only dfrring th
momnt of making th ffort to lift thos lgs up and turn ovr on th
bd. “Ugh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might nd and you would
rlas m!” thought h. Prssing his lips togthr h mad that ffort
for th twnty-thousandth tim and lay down. But hardly had h don so
bfor h flt th bd rocking backwards and forwards bnath him as if
it wr brathing havily and jolting. This happnd to him almost vry
night. H opnd his ys as thy wr closing.
“No pac, damn thm!” h muttrd, angry h knw not with whom. “Ah
ys, thr was somthing ls important, vry important, that I was
kping till I should b in bd. Th bolts? No, I told him about thm.
No, it was somthing, somthing in th drawing room. Princss Mary
talkd som nonsns. Dssalls, that fool, said somthing. Somthing in
my pockt—can’t rmmbr....”
“Tíkhon, what did w talk about at dinnr?”
“About Princ Michal...”
“B quit, quit!” Th princ slappd his hand on th tabl. “Ys, I
know, Princ Andrw’s lttr! Princss Mary rad it. Dssalls said
somthing about Vítbsk. Now I’ll rad it.”
H had th lttr takn from his pockt and th tabl—on which stood a
glass of lmonad and a spiral wax candl—movd clos to th bd, and
putting on his spctacls h bgan rading. Only now in th stillnss of
th night, rading it by th faint light undr th grn shad, did h
grasp its maning for a momnt.
“Th Frnch at Vítbsk, in four days’ march thy may b at Smolnsk;
prhaps ar alrady thr! Tíkhon!” Tíkhon jumpd up. “No, no, I don’t
want anything!” h shoutd.
H put th lttr undr th candlstick and closd his ys. And thr
ros bfor him th Danub at bright noonday: rds, th Russian
camp, and himslf a young gnral without a wrinkl on his ruddy fac,
vigorous and alrt, ntring Potëmkin’s gaily colord tnt, and a
burning sns of jalousy of “th favorit” agitatd him now as strongly
as it had don thn. H rcalld all th words spokn at that
first mting with Potëmkin. And h saw bfor him a plump, rathr
sallow-facd, short, stout woman, th mprss Mothr, with hr smil
and hr words at hr first gracious rcption of him, and thn that sam
fac on th catafalqu, and th ncountr h had with Zúbov ovr hr
coffin about his right to kiss hr hand.
“Oh, quickr, quickr! To gt back to that tim and hav don with all
th prsnt! Quickr, quickr—and that thy should lav m in pac!”
CHAPTR IV
Bald Hills, Princ Nicholas Bolkónski’s stat, lay forty mils ast
from Smolnsk and two mils from th main road to Moscow.
Th sam vning that th princ gav his instructions to Alpátych,
Dssalls, having askd to s Princss Mary, told hr that, as th
princ was not vry wll and was taking no stps to scur his safty,
though from Princ Andrw’s lttr it was vidnt that to rmain at Bald
Hills might b dangrous, h rspctfully advisd hr to snd a lttr
by Alpátych to th Provincial Govrnor at Smolnsk, asking him to lt
hr know th stat of affairs and th xtnt of th dangr to which
Bald Hills was xposd. Dssalls wrot this lttr to th Govrnor
for Princss Mary, sh signd it, and it was givn to Alpátych with
instructions to hand it to th Govrnor and to com back as quickly as
possibl if thr was dangr.
Having rcivd all his ordrs Alpátych, waring a whit bavr hat—a
prsnt from th princ—and carrying a stick as th princ did, wnt out
accompanid by his family. Thr wll-fd roans stood rady harnssd to
a small convyanc with a lathr hood.
Th largr bll was muffld and th littl blls on th harnss stuffd
with papr. Th princ allowd no on at Bald Hills to driv with
ringing blls; but on a long journy Alpátych likd to hav thm. His
satllits—th snior clrk, a countinghous clrk, a scullry maid,
a cook, two old womn, a littl pagboy, th coachman, and various
domstic srfs—wr sing him off.
His daughtr placd chintz-covrd down cushions for him to sit on and
bhind his back. His old sistr-in-law poppd in a small bundl, and on
of th coachmn hlpd him into th vhicl.
“Thr! Thr! Womn’s fuss! Womn, womn!” said Alpátych, puffing and
spaking rapidly just as th princ did, and h climbd into th trap.
Aftr giving th clrk ordrs about th work to b don, Alpátych, not
trying to imitat th princ now, liftd th hat from his bald had and
crossd himslf thr tims.
“If thr is anything... com back, Yákov Alpátych! For Christ’s sak
think of us!” crid his wif, rfrring to th rumors of war and th
nmy.
“Womn, womn! Womn’s fuss!” muttrd Alpátych to himslf and startd
on his journy, looking round at th filds of yllow ry and th
still-grn, thickly growing oats, and at othr quit black filds just
bing plowd a scond tim.
As h wnt along h lookd with plasur at th yar’s splndid crop
of corn, scrutinizd th strips of ryfild which hr and thr wr
alrady bing rapd, mad his calculations as to th sowing and th
harvst, and askd himslf whthr h had not forgottn any of th
princ’s ordrs.
Having baitd th horss twic on th way, h arrivd at th town toward
vning on th fourth of August.
Alpátych kpt mting and ovrtaking baggag trains and troops on th
road. As h approachd Smolnsk h hard th sounds of distant firing,
but ths did not imprss him. What struck him most was th sight of a
splndid fild of oats in which a camp had bn pitchd and which
was bing mown down by th soldirs, vidntly for foddr. This fact
imprssd Alpátych, but in thinking about his own businss h soon
forgot it.
All th intrsts of his lif for mor than thirty yars had bn
boundd by th will of th princ, and h nvr wnt byond that limit.
vrything not connctd with th xcution of th princ’s ordrs did
not intrst and did not vn xist for Alpátych.
On raching Smolnsk on th vning of th fourth of August h put up
in th Gáchina suburb across th Dnipr, at th inn kpt by Frapóntov,
whr h had bn in th habit of putting up for th last thirty yars.
Som thirty yars ago Frapóntov, by Alpátych’s advic, had bought a
wood from th princ, had bgun to trad, and now had a hous, an
inn, and a corn dalr’s shop in that provinc. H was a stout, dark,
rd-facd pasant in th fortis, with thick lips, a broad knob of a
nos, similar knobs ovr his black frowning brows, and a round blly.
Waring a waistcoat ovr his cotton shirt, Frapóntov was standing
bfor his shop which opnd onto th strt. On sing Alpátych h wnt
up to him.
“You’r wlcom, Yákov Alpátych. Folks ar laving th town, but you
hav com to it,” said h.
“Why ar thy laving th town?” askd Alpátych.
“That’s what I say. Folks ar foolish! Always afraid of th Frnch.”
“Womn’s fuss, womn’s fuss!” said Alpátych.
“Just what I think, Yákov Alpátych. What I say is: ordrs hav bn
givn not to lt thm in, so that must b right. And th pasants ar
asking thr rubls for carting—it isn’t Christian!”
Yákov Alpátych hard without hding. H askd for a samovar and for hay
for his horss, and whn h had had his ta h wnt to bd.
All night long troops wr moving past th inn. Nxt morning Alpátych
donnd a jackt h wor only in town and wnt out on businss. It was a
sunny morning and by ight o’clock it was alrady hot. “A good day for
harvsting,” thought Alpátych.
From byond th town firing had bn hard sinc arly morning. At ight
o’clock th booming of cannon was addd to th sound of musktry. Many
popl wr hurrying through th strts and thr wr many soldirs,
but cabs wr still driving about, tradsmn stood at thir shops, and
srvic was bing hld in th churchs as usual. Alpátych wnt to th
shops, to govrnmnt offics, to th post offic, and to th Govrnor’s.
In th offics and shops and at th post offic vryon was talking
about th army and about th nmy who was alrady attacking th town,
vrybody was asking what should b don, and all wr trying to calm
on anothr.
In front of th Govrnor’s hous Alpátych found a larg numbr of
popl, Cossacks, and a travling carriag of th Govrnor’s. At th
porch h mt two of th landd gntry, on of whom h knw. This man, an
x-captain of polic, was saying angrily:
“It’s no jok, you know! It’s all vry wll if you’r singl. ‘On man
though undon is but on,’ as th provrb says, but with thirtn in
your family and all th proprty... Thy’v brought us to uttr ruin!
What sort of govrnors ar thy to do that? Thy ought to b hangd—th
brigands!...”
“Oh com, that’s nough!” said th othr.
“What do I car? Lt him har! W’r not dogs,” said th x-captain of
polic, and looking round h noticd Alpátych.
“Oh, Yákov Alpátych! What hav you com for?”
“To s th Govrnor by his xcllncy’s ordr,” answrd Alpátych,
lifting his had and proudly thrusting his hand into th bosom of his
coat as h always did whn h mntiond th princ.... “H has ordrd
m to inquir into th position of affairs,” h addd.
“Ys, go and find out!” shoutd th angry gntlman. “Thy’v brought
things to such a pass that thr ar no carts or anything!... Thr it
is again, do you har?” said h, pointing in th dirction whnc cam
th sounds of firing.
“Thy’v brought us all to ruin... th brigands!” h rpatd, and
dscndd th porch stps.
Alpátych swayd his had and wnt upstairs. In th waiting room wr
tradsmn, womn, and officials, looking silntly at on anothr. Th
door of th Govrnor’s room opnd and thy all ros and movd forward.
An official ran out, said som words to a mrchant, calld a stout
official with a cross hanging on his nck to follow him, and vanishd
again, vidntly wishing to avoid th inquiring looks and qustions
addrssd to him. Alpátych movd forward and nxt tim th official cam
out addrssd him, on hand placd in th brast of his buttond coat,
and handd him two lttrs.
“To his Honor Baron Asch, from Gnral-in-Chif Princ Bolkónski,” h
announcd with such solmnity and significanc that th official turnd
to him and took th lttrs.
A fw minuts latr th Govrnor rcivd Alpátych and hurridly said to
him:
“Inform th princ and princss that I knw nothing: I actd on th
highst instructions—hr...” and h handd a papr to Alpátych. “Still,
as th princ is unwll my advic is that thy should go to Moscow. I am
just starting myslf. Inform thm...”
But th Govrnor did not finish: a dusty prspiring officr ran into th
room and bgan to say somthing in Frnch. Th Govrnor’s fac xprssd
trror.
“Go,” h said, nodding his had to Alpátych, and bgan qustioning th
officr.
agr, frightnd, hlplss glancs wr turnd on Alpátych whn h cam
out of th Govrnor’s room. Involuntarily listning now to th firing,
which had drawn narr and was incrasing in strngth, Alpátych hurrid
to his inn. Th papr handd to him by th Govrnor said this:
“I assur you that th town of Smolnsk is not in th slightst dangr
as yt and it is unlikly that it will b thratnd with any. I from
th on sid and Princ Bagratión from th othr ar marching to unit
our forcs bfor Smolnsk, which junction will b ffctd on th
22nd instant, and both armis with thir unitd forcs will dfnd our
compatriots of th provinc ntrustd to your car till our fforts
shall hav batn back th nmis of our Fathrland, or till th last
warrior in our valiant ranks has prishd. From this you will s that
you hav a prfct right to rassur th inhabitants of Smolnsk, for
thos dfndd by two such brav armis may fl assurd of victory.”
(Instructions from Barclay d Tolly to Baron Asch, th civil govrnor of
Smolnsk, 1812.)
Popl wr anxiously roaming about th strts.
Carts pild high with houshold utnsils, chairs, and cupboards kpt
mrging from th gats of th yards and moving along th strts.
Loadd carts stood at th hous nxt to Frapóntov’s and womn wr
wailing and lamnting as thy said good-by. A small watchdog ran round
barking in front of th harnssd horss.
Alpátych ntrd th innyard at a quickr pac than usual and wnt
straight to th shd whr his horss and trap wr. Th coachman was
aslp. H wok him up, told him to harnss, and wnt into th passag.
From th host’s room cam th sounds of a child crying, th dspairing
sobs of a woman, and th hoars angry shouting of Frapóntov. Th cook
bgan running hithr and thithr in th passag lik a frightnd hn,
just as Alpátych ntrd.
“H’s don hr to dath. Killd th mistrss!... Bat hr... draggd hr
about so!...”
“What for?” askd Alpátych.
“Sh kpt bgging to go away. Sh’s a woman! ‘Tak m away,’ says sh,
‘don’t lt m prish with my littl childrn! Folks,’ sh says, ‘ar all
gon, so why,’ sh says, ‘don’t w go?’ And h bgan bating and pulling
hr about so!”
At ths words Alpátych noddd as if in approval, and not wishing to
har mor wnt to th door of th room opposit th innkpr’s, whr
h had lft his purchass.
“You brut, you murdrr!” scramd a thin, pal woman who, with a baby
in hr arms and hr krchif torn from hr had, burst through th door
at that momnt and down th stps into th yard.
Frapóntov cam out aftr hr, but on sing Alpátych adjustd his
waistcoat, smoothd his hair, yawnd, and followd Alpátych into th
opposit room.
“Going alrady?” said h.
Alpátych, without answring or looking at his host, sortd his packags
and askd how much h owd.
“W’ll rckon up! Wll, hav you bn to th Govrnor’s?” askd
Frapóntov. “What has bn dcidd?”
Alpátych rplid that th Govrnor had not told him anything dfinit.
“With our businss, how can w gt away?” said Frapóntov. “W’d hav
to pay svn rubls a cartload to Dorogobúzh and I tll thm thy’r
not Christians to ask it! Slivánov, now, did a good strok last
Thursday—sold flour to th army at nin rubls a sack. Will you hav
som ta?” h addd.
Whil th horss wr bing harnssd Alpátych and Frapóntov ovr thir
ta talkd of th pric of corn, th crops, and th good wathr for
harvsting.
“Wll, it sms to b gtting quitr,” rmarkd Frapóntov, finishing
his third cup of ta and gtting up. “Ours must hav got th bst of it.
Th ordrs wr not to lt thm in. So w’r in forc, it sms....
Thy say th othr day Matthw Iványch Plátov drov thm into th rivr
Márina and drownd som ightn thousand in on day.”
Alpátych collctd his parcls, handd thm to th coachman who had com
in, and sttld up with th innkpr. Th nois of whls, hoofs, and
blls was hard from th gatway as a littl trap passd out.
It was by now lat in th aftrnoon. Half th strt was in shadow, th
othr half brightly lit by th sun. Alpátych lookd out of th window
and wnt to th door. Suddnly th strang sound of a far-off whistling
and thud was hard, followd by a boom of cannon blnding into a dull
roar that st th windows rattling.
H wnt out into th strt: two mn wr running past toward th
bridg. From diffrnt sids cam whistling sounds and th thud of
cannon balls and bursting shlls falling on th town. But ths sounds
wr hardly hard in comparison with th nois of th firing outsid th
town and attractd littl attntion from th inhabitants. Th town was
bing bombardd by a hundrd and thirty guns which Napolon had ordrd
up aftr four o’clock. Th popl did not at onc raliz th maning of
this bombardmnt.
At first th nois of th falling bombs and shlls only arousd
curiosity. Frapóntov’s wif, who till thn had not casd wailing undr
th shd, bcam quit and with th baby in hr arms wnt to th gat,
listning to th sounds and looking in silnc at th popl.
Th cook and a shop assistant cam to th gat. With livly curiosity
vryon trid to gt a glimps of th projctils as thy flw ovr
thir hads. Svral popl cam round th cornr talking agrly.
“What forc!” rmarkd on. “Knockd th roof and ciling all to
splintrs!”
“Routd up th arth lik a pig,” said anothr.
“That’s grand, it bucks on up!” laughd th first. “Lucky you jumpd
asid, or it would hav wipd you out!”
Othrs joind thos mn and stoppd and told how cannon balls had falln
on a hous clos to thm. Manwhil still mor projctils, now with
th swift sinistr whistl of a cannon ball, now with th agrabl
intrmittnt whistl of a shll, flw ovr popl’s hads incssantly,
but not on fll clos by, thy all flw ovr. Alpátych was gtting into
his trap. Th innkpr stood at th gat.
“What ar you staring at?” h shoutd to th cook, who in hr rd skirt,
with slvs rolld up, swinging hr bar lbows, had stppd to th
cornr to listn to what was bing said.
“What marvls!” sh xclaimd, but haring hr mastr’s voic sh turnd
back, pulling down hr tuckd-up skirt.
Onc mor somthing whistld, but this tim quit clos, swooping
downwards lik a littl bird; a flam flashd in th middl of th
strt, somthing xplodd, and th strt was shroudd in smok.
“Scoundrl, what ar you doing?” shoutd th innkpr, rushing to th
cook.
At that momnt th pitiful wailing of womn was hard from diffrnt
sids, th frightnd baby bgan to cry, and popl crowdd silntly
with pal facs round th cook. Th loudst sound in that crowd was hr
wailing.
“Oh-h-h! Dar souls, dar kind souls! Don’t lt m di! My good
souls!...”
Fiv minuts latr no on rmaind in th strt. Th cook, with hr
thigh brokn by a shll splintr, had bn carrid into th kitchn.
Alpátych, his coachman, Frapóntov’s wif and childrn and th hous
portr wr all sitting in th cllar, listning. Th roar of guns, th
whistling of projctils, and th pitous moaning of th cook, which
ros abov th othr sounds, did not cas for a momnt. Th mistrss
rockd and hushd hr baby and whn anyon cam into th cllar askd
in a pathtic whispr what had bcom of hr husband who had rmaind
in th strt. A shopman who ntrd told hr that hr husband had
gon with othrs to th cathdral, whnc thy wr ftching th
wondr-working icon of Smolnsk.
Toward dusk th cannonad bgan to subsid. Alpátych lft th cllar
and stoppd in th doorway. Th vning sky that had bn so clar was
cloudd with smok, through which, high up, th sickl of th nw moon
shon strangly. Now that th trribl din of th guns had casd a hush
smd to rign ovr th town, brokn only by th rustl of footstps,
th moaning, th distant cris, and th crackl of firs which smd
widsprad vrywhr. Th cook’s moans had now subsidd. On two sids
black curling clouds of smok ros and sprad from th firs. Through
th strts soldirs in various uniforms walkd or ran confusdly in
diffrnt dirctions lik ants from a ruind ant-hill. Svral of thm
ran into Frapóntov’s yard bfor Alpátych’s ys. Alpátych wnt out
to th gat. A rtrating rgimnt, thronging and hurrying, blockd th
strt.
Noticing him, an officr said: “Th town is bing abandond. Gt away,
gt away!” and thn, turning to th soldirs, shoutd:
“I’ll tach you to run into th yards!”
Alpátych wnt back to th hous, calld th coachman, and told him to
st off. Frapóntov’s whol houshold cam out too, following Alpátych
and th coachman. Th womn, who had bn silnt till thn, suddnly
bgan to wail as thy lookd at th firs—th smok and vn th flams
of which could b sn in th failing twilight—and as if in rply th
sam kind of lamntation was hard from othr parts of th strt.
Insid th shd Alpátych and th coachman arrangd th tangld rins and
tracs of thir horss with trmbling hands.
As Alpátych was driving out of th gat h saw som tn soldirs in
Frapóntov’s opn shop, talking loudly and filling thir bags and
knapsacks with flour and sunflowr sds. Just thn Frapóntov rturnd
and ntrd his shop. On sing th soldirs h was about to shout at
thm, but suddnly stoppd and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs
and laughtr:
“Loot vrything, lads! Don’t lt thos dvils gt it!” h crid, taking
som bags of flour himslf and throwing thm into th strt.
Som of th soldirs wr frightnd and ran away, othrs wnt on
filling thir bags. On sing Alpátych, Frapóntov turnd to him:
“Russia is don for!” h crid. “Alpátych, I’ll st th plac on fir
myslf. W’r don for!...” and Frapóntov ran into th yard.
Soldirs wr passing in a constant stram along th strt blocking
it compltly, so that Alpátych could not pass out and had to wait.
Frapóntov’s wif and childrn wr also sitting in a cart waiting till
it was possibl to driv out.
Night had com. Thr wr stars in th sky and th nw moon shon out
amid th smok that scrnd it. On th sloping dscnt to th Dnipr
Alpátych’s cart and that of th innkpr’s wif, which wr slowly
moving amid th rows of soldirs and of othr vhicls, had to stop.
In a sid strt nar th crossroads whr th vhicls had stoppd, a
hous and som shops wr on fir. This fir was alrady burning itslf
out. Th flams now did down and wr lost in th black smok, now
suddnly flard up again brightly, lighting up with strang distinctnss
th facs of th popl crowding at th crossroads. Black figurs
flittd about bfor th fir, and through th incssant crackling of
th flams talking and shouting could b hard. Sing that his trap
would not b abl to mov on for som tim, Alpátych got down and turnd
into th sid strt to look at th fir. Soldirs wr continually
rushing backwards and forwards nar it, and h saw two of thm and a
man in a friz coat dragging burning bams into anothr yard across th
strt, whil othrs carrid bundls of hay.
Alpátych wnt up to a larg crowd standing bfor a high barn which was
blazing briskly. Th walls wr all on fir and th back wall had falln
in, th woodn roof was collapsing, and th raftrs wr alight. Th
crowd was vidntly watching for th roof to fall in, and Alpátych
watchd for it too.
“Alpátych!” a familiar voic suddnly haild th old man.
“Mrcy on us! Your xcllncy!” answrd Alpátych, immdiatly
rcognizing th voic of his young princ.
Princ Andrw in his riding cloak, mountd on a black hors, was looking
at Alpátych from th back of th crowd.
“Why ar you hr?” h askd.
“Your... your xcllncy,” stammrd Alpátych and brok into sobs. “Ar
w rally lost? Mastr!...”
“Why ar you hr?” Princ Andrw rpatd.
At that momnt th flams flard up and showd his young mastr’s pal
worn fac. Alpátych told how h had bn snt thr and how difficult it
was to gt away.
“Ar w rally quit lost, your xcllncy?” h askd again.
Princ Andrw without rplying took out a notbook and raising his kn
bgan writing in pncil on a pag h tor out. H wrot to his sistr:
“Smolnsk is bing abandond. Bald Hills will b occupid by th nmy
within a wk. St off immdiatly for Moscow. Lt m know at onc whn
you will start. Snd by spcial mssngr to Usvyázh.”
Having writtn this and givn th papr to Alpátych, h told him how
to arrang for dpartur of th princ, th princss, his son, and th
boy’s tutor, and how and whr to lt him know immdiatly. Bfor
h had had tim to finish giving ths instructions, a chif of staff
followd by a suit gallopd up to him.
“You ar a colonl?” shoutd th chif of staff with a Grman accnt,
in a voic familiar to Princ Andrw. “Houss ar st on fir in your
prsnc and you stand by! What dos this man? You will answr for
it!” shoutd Brg, who was now assistant to th chif of staff of th
commandr of th lft flank of th infantry of th first army, a plac,
as Brg said, “vry agrabl and wll n vidnc.”
Princ Andrw lookd at him and without rplying wnt on spaking to
Alpátych.
“So tll thm that I shall await a rply till th tnth, and if by th
tnth I don’t rciv nws that thy hav all got away I shall hav to
throw up vrything and com myslf to Bald Hills.”
“Princ,” said Brg, rcognizing Princ Andrw, “I only spok bcaus
I hav to oby ordrs, bcaus I always do oby xactly.... You must
plas xcus m,” h wnt on apologtically.
Somthing crackd in th flams. Th fir did down for a momnt and
wraths of black smok rolld from undr th roof. Thr was anothr
trribl crash and somthing hug collapsd.
“Ou-rou-rou!” ylld th crowd, choing th crash of th collapsing roof
of th barn, th burning grain in which diffusd a caklik aroma all
around. Th flams flard up again, lighting th animatd, dlightd,
xhaustd facs of th spctators.
Th man in th friz coat raisd his arms and shoutd:
“It’s fin, lads! Now it’s raging... It’s fin!”
“That’s th ownr himslf,” crid svral voics.
“Wll thn,” continud Princ Andrw to Alpátych, “rport to thm as I
hav told you”; and not rplying a word to Brg who was now mut bsid
him, h touchd his hors and rod down th sid strt.
CHAPTR V
From Smolnsk th troops continud to rtrat, followd by th nmy.
On th tnth of August th rgimnt Princ Andrw commandd was marching
along th highroad past th avnu lading to Bald Hills. Hat and
drought had continud for mor than thr wks. ach day flcy clouds
floatd across th sky and occasionally vild th sun, but toward
vning th sky clard again and th sun st in rddish-brown mist.
Havy night dws alon rfrshd th arth. Th unrapd corn was
scorchd and shd its grain. Th marshs drid up. Th cattl lowd from
hungr, finding no food on th sun-parchd madows. Only at night and
in th forsts whil th dw lastd was thr any frshnss. But on th
road, th highroad along which th troops marchd, thr was no such
frshnss vn at night or whn th road passd through th forst; th
dw was imprcptibl on th sandy dust churnd up mor than six inchs
dp. As soon as day dawnd th march bgan. Th artillry and baggag
wagons movd noislssly through th dp dust that ros to th vry
hubs of th whls, and th infantry sank ankl-dp in that soft,
choking, hot dust that nvr coold vn at night. Som of this dust
was knadd by th ft and whls, whil th rst ros and hung lik a
cloud ovr th troops, sttling in ys, ars, hair, and nostrils, and
worst of all in th lungs of th mn and basts as thy movd along that
road. Th highr th sun ros th highr ros that cloud of dust, and
through th scrn of its hot fin particls on could look with nakd
y at th sun, which showd lik a hug crimson ball in th uncloudd
sky. Thr was no wind, and th mn chokd in that motionlss
atmosphr. Thy marchd with handkrchifs tid ovr thir noss and
mouths. Whn thy passd through a villag thy all rushd to th wlls
and fought for th watr and drank it down to th mud.
Princ Andrw was in command of a rgimnt, and th managmnt of that
rgimnt, th wlfar of th mn and th ncssity of rciving
and giving ordrs, ngrossd him. Th burning of Smolnsk and its
abandonmnt mad an poch in his lif. A novl fling of angr against
th fo mad him forgt his own sorrow. H was ntirly dvotd to th
affairs of his rgimnt and was considrat and kind to his mn and
officrs. In th rgimnt thy calld him “our princ,” wr proud
of him and lovd him. But h was kind and gntl only to thos of his
rgimnt, to Timókhin and th lik—popl quit nw to him, blonging
to a diffrnt world and who could not know and undrstand his past. As
soon as h cam across a formr acquaintanc or anyon from th
staff, h bristld up immdiatly and grw spitful, ironical, and
contmptuous. vrything that rmindd him of his past was rpugnant to
him, and so in his rlations with that formr circl h confind himslf
to trying to do his duty and not to b unfair.
In truth vrything prsntd itslf in a dark and gloomy light to
Princ Andrw, spcially aftr th abandonmnt of Smolnsk on th sixth
of August (h considrd that it could and should hav bn dfndd)
and aftr his sick fathr had had to fl to Moscow, abandoning to
pillag his darly blovd Bald Hills which h had built and popld.
But dspit this, thanks to his rgimnt, Princ Andrw had somthing to
think about ntirly apart from gnral qustions. Two days prviously
h had rcivd nws that his fathr, son, and sistr had lft for
Moscow; and though thr was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Princ
Andrw with a charactristic dsir to fomnt his own grif dcidd that
h must rid thr.
H ordrd his hors to b saddld and, laving his rgimnt on th
march, rod to his fathr’s stat whr h had bn born and spnt his
childhood. Riding past th pond whr thr usd always to b dozns
of womn chattring as thy rinsd thir linn or bat it with woodn
btls, Princ Andrw noticd that thr was not a soul about and that
th littl washing wharf, torn from its plac and half submrgd, was
floating on its sid in th middl of th pond. H rod to th kpr’s
lodg. No on at th ston ntranc gats of th driv and th door
stood opn. Grass had alrady bgun to grow on th gardn paths, and
horss and calvs wr straying in th nglish park. Princ Andrw rod
up to th hothous; som of th glass pans wr brokn, and of th
trs in tubs som wr ovrturnd and othrs drid up. H calld for
Tarás th gardnr, but no on rplid. Having gon round th cornr
of th hothous to th ornamntal gardn, h saw that th carvd gardn
fnc was brokn and branchs of th plum trs had bn torn off with
th fruit. An old pasant whom Princ Andrw in his childhood had oftn
sn at th gat was sitting on a grn gardn sat, plaiting a bast
sho.
H was daf and did not har Princ Andrw rid up. H was sitting on
th sat th old princ usd to lik to sit on, and bsid him strips of
bast wr hanging on th brokn and withrd branch of a magnolia.
Princ Andrw rod up to th hous. Svral lims in th old gardn had
bn cut down and a pibald mar and hr foal wr wandring in front of
th hous among th rosbushs. Th shuttrs wr all closd, xcpt at
on window which was opn. A littl srf boy, sing Princ Andrw, ran
into th hous. Alpátych, having snt his family away, was alon at
Bald Hills and was sitting indoors rading th Livs of th Saints. On
haring that Princ Andrw had com, h wnt out with his spctacls on
his nos, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stpping up, without a word
bgan wping and kissing Princ Andrw’s kn.
Thn, vxd at his own waknss, h turnd away and bgan to rport
on th position of affairs. vrything prcious and valuabl had bn
rmovd to Boguchárovo. Svnty quartrs of grain had also bn cartd
away. Th hay and th spring corn, of which Alpátych said thr had bn
a rmarkabl crop that yar, had bn commandrd by th troops and
mown down whil still grn. Th pasants wr ruind; som of thm too
had gon to Boguchárovo, only a fw rmaind.
Without waiting to har him out, Princ Andrw askd:
“Whn did my fathr and sistr lav?” maning whn did thy lav for
Moscow.
Alpátych, undrstanding th qustion to rfr to thir dpartur for
Boguchárovo, rplid that thy had lft on th svnth and again wnt
into dtails concrning th stat managmnt, asking for instructions.
“Am I to lt th troops hav th oats, and to tak a rcipt for thm?
W hav still six hundrd quartrs lft,” h inquird.
“What am I to say to him?” thought Princ Andrw, looking down on th
old man’s bald had shining in th sun and sing by th xprssion on
his fac that th old man himslf undrstood how untimly such qustions
wr and only askd thm to allay his grif.
“Ys, lt thm hav it,” rplid Princ Andrw.
“If you noticd som disordr in th gardn,” said Alpátych, “it was
impossibl to prvnt it. Thr rgimnts hav bn hr and spnt
th night, dragoons mostly. I took down th nam and rank of thir
commanding officr, to hand in a complaint about it.”
“Wll, and what ar you going to do? Will you stay hr if th nmy
occupis th plac?” askd Princ Andrw.
Alpátych turnd his fac to Princ Andrw, lookd at him, and suddnly
with a solmn gstur raisd his arm.
“H is my rfug! His will b don!” h xclaimd.
A group of barhadd pasants was approaching across th madow toward
th princ.
“Wll, good-by!” said Princ Andrw, bnding ovr to Alpátych. “You
must go away too, tak away what you can and tll th srfs to go to th
Ryazán stat or to th on nar Moscow.”
Alpátych clung to Princ Andrw’s lg and burst into sobs. Gntly
disngaging himslf, th princ spurrd his hors and rod down th
avnu at a gallop.
Th old man was still sitting in th ornamntal gardn, lik a fly
impassiv on th fac of a lovd on who is dad, tapping th last on
which h was making th bast sho, and two littl girls, running out
from th hot hous carrying in thir skirts plums thy had pluckd from
th trs thr, cam upon Princ Andrw. On sing th young mastr,
th ldr on with frightnd look clutchd hr youngr companion by th
hand and hid with hr bhind a birch tr, not stopping to pick up som
grn plums thy had droppd.
Princ Andrw turnd away with startld hast, unwilling to lt thm
s that thy had bn obsrvd. H was sorry for th prtty frightnd
littl girl, was afraid of looking at hr, and yt flt an irrsistibl
dsir to do so. A nw snsation of comfort and rlif cam ovr him
whn, sing ths girls, h ralizd th xistnc of othr human
intrsts ntirly aloof from his own and just as lgitimat as thos
that occupid him. vidntly ths girls passionatly dsird on
thing—to carry away and at thos grn plums without bing caught—and
Princ Andrw shard thir wish for th succss of thir ntrpris. H
could not rsist looking at thm onc mor. Bliving thir dangr past,
thy sprang from thir ambush and, chirruping somthing in thir shrill
littl voics and holding up thir skirts, thir bar littl sunburnd
ft scamprd mrrily and quickly across th madow grass.
Princ Andrw was somwhat rfrshd by having riddn off th dusty
highroad along which th troops wr moving. But not far from Bald Hills
h again cam out on th road and ovrtook his rgimnt at its halting
plac by th dam of a small pond. It was past on o’clock. Th sun,
a rd ball through th dust, burnd and scorchd his back intolrably
through his black coat. Th dust always hung motionlss abov th buzz
of talk that cam from th rsting troops. Thr was no wind. As h
crossd th dam Princ Andrw smlld th ooz and frshnss of th
pond. H longd to gt into that watr, howvr dirty it might b, and
h glancd round at th pool from whnc cam sounds of shriks and
laughtr. Th small, muddy, grn pond had risn visibly mor than a
foot, flooding th dam, bcaus it was full of th nakd whit bodis
of soldirs with brick-rd hands, ncks, and facs, who wr splashing
about in it. All this nakd whit human flsh, laughing and shriking,
floundrd about in that dirty pool lik carp stuffd into a watring
can, and th suggstion of mrrimnt in that floundring mass rndrd
it spcially pathtic.
On fair-haird young soldir of th third company, whom Princ Andrw
knw and who had a strap round th calf of on lg, crossd himslf,
stppd back to gt a good run, and plungd into th watr; anothr,
a dark noncommissiond officr who was always shaggy, stood up to his
waist in th watr joyfully wriggling his muscular figur and snortd
with satisfaction as h pourd th watr ovr his had with hands
blacknd to th wrists. Thr wr sounds of mn slapping on anothr,
ylling, and puffing.
vrywhr on th bank, on th dam, and in th pond, thr was halthy,
whit, muscular flsh. Th officr, Timókhin, with his rd littl nos,
standing on th dam wiping himslf with a towl, flt confusd at sing
th princ, but mad up his mind to addrss him nvrthlss.
“It’s vry nic, your xcllncy! Wouldn’t you lik to?” said h.
“It’s dirty,” rplid Princ Andrw, making a grimac.
“W’ll clar it out for you in a minut,” said Timókhin, and, still
undrssd, ran off to clar th mn out of th pond.
“Th princ wants to bath.”
“What princ? Ours?” said many voics, and th mn wr in such hast
to clar out that th princ could hardly stop thm. H dcidd that h
would rathr wash himslf with watr in th barn.
“Flsh, bodis, cannon foddr!” h thought, and h lookd at his own
nakd body and shuddrd, not from cold but from a sns of disgust
and horror h did not himslf undrstand, arousd by th sight of that
immns numbr of bodis splashing about in th dirty pond.
On th svnth of August Princ Bagratión wrot as follows from his
quartrs at Mikháylovna on th Smolnsk road:
Dar Count Alxis Andrvich—(H was writing to Arakchv but knw that
his lttr would b rad by th mpror, and thrfor wighd vry
word in it to th bst of his ability.)
I xpct th Ministr (Barclay d Tolly) has alrady rportd th
abandonmnt of Smolnsk to th nmy. It is pitiabl and sad, and
th whol army is in dspair that this most important plac has bn
wantonly abandond. I, for my part, bggd him prsonally most urgntly
and finally wrot him, but nothing would induc him to consnt. I swar
to you on my honor that Napolon was in such a fix as nvr bfor and
might hav lost half his army but could not hav takn Smolnsk. Our
troops fought, and ar fighting, as nvr bfor. With fiftn thousand
mn I hld th nmy at bay for thirty-fiv hours and bat him; but h
would not hold out vn for fourtn hours. It is disgracful, a stain
on our army, and as for him, h ought, it sms to m, not to liv. If
h rports that our losss wr grat, it is not tru; prhaps about
four thousand, not mor, and not vn that; but vn wr thy tn
thousand, that’s war! But th nmy has lost masss....
What would it hav cost him to hold out for anothr two days? Thy would
hav had to rtir of thir own accord, for thy had no watr for mn
or horss. H gav m his word h would not rtrat, but suddnly snt
instructions that h was rtiring that night. W cannot fight in this
way, or w may soon bring th nmy to Moscow....
Thr is a rumor that you ar thinking of pac. God forbid that you
should mak pac aftr all our sacrifics and such insan rtrats! You
would st all Russia against you and vryon of us would fl ashamd
to war th uniform. If it has com to this—w must fight as long as
Russia can and as long as thr ar mn abl to stand....
On man ought to b in command, and not two. Your Ministr may prhaps
b good as a Ministr, but as a gnral h is not mrly bad but
xcrabl, yt to him is ntrustd th fat of our whol country.... I
am rally frantic with vxation; forgiv my writing boldly. It is clar
that th man who advocats th conclusion of a pac, and that th
Ministr should command th army, dos not lov our sovrign and
dsirs th ruin of us all. So I writ you frankly: call out th
militia. For th Ministr is lading ths visitors aftr him to Moscow
in a most mastrly way. Th whol army fls grat suspicion of th
Imprial aid-d-camp Wolzogn. H is said to b mor Napolon’s man
than ours, and h is always advising th Ministr. I am not mrly civil
to him but oby him lik a corporal, though I am his snior. This is
painful, but, loving my bnfactor and sovrign, I submit. Only I am
sorry for th mpror that h ntrusts our fin army to such as h.
Considr that on our rtrat w hav lost by fatigu and lft in th
hospital mor than fiftn thousand mn, and had w attackd this would
not hav happnd. Tll m, for God’s sak, what will Russia, our mothr
Russia, say to our bing so frightnd, and why ar w abandoning our
good and gallant Fathrland to such rabbl and implanting flings of
hatrd and sham in all our subjcts? What ar w scard at and of whom
ar w afraid? I am not to blam that th Ministr is vacillating,
a coward, dns, dilatory, and has all bad qualitis. Th whol army
bwails it and calls down curss upon him....
CHAPTR VI
Among th innumrabl catgoris applicabl to th phnomna of human
lif on may discriminat btwn thos in which substanc prvails
and thos in which form prvails. To th lattr—as distinguishd
from villag, country, provincial, or vn Moscow lif—w may allot
Ptrsburg lif, and spcially th lif of its salons. That lif of
th salons is unchanging. Sinc th yar 1805 w had mad pac and had
again quarrld with Bonapart and had mad constitutions and unmad
thm again, but th salons of Anna Pávlovna and Hlèn rmaind just
as thy had bn—th on svn and th othr fiv yars bfor. At Anna
Pávlovna’s thy talkd with prplxity of Bonapart’s succsss just
as bfor and saw in thm and in th subsrvinc shown to him by th
uropan sovrigns a malicious conspiracy, th sol objct of which was
to caus unplasantnss and anxity to th court circl of which Anna
Pávlovna was th rprsntativ. And in Hlèn’s salon, which Rumyántsv
himslf honord with his visits, rgarding Hlèn as a rmarkably
intllignt woman, thy talkd with th sam cstasy in 1812 as in 1808
of th “grat nation” and th “grat man,” and rgrttd our ruptur
with Franc, a ruptur which, according to thm, ought to b promptly
trminatd by pac.
Of lat, sinc th mpror’s rturn from th army, thr had bn som
xcitmnt in ths conflicting salon circls and som dmonstrations
of hostility to on anothr, but ach camp rtaind its own tndncy.
In Anna Pávlovna’s circl only thos Frnchmn wr admittd who wr
dp-rootd lgitimists, and patriotic viws wr xprssd to th
ffct that on ought not to go to th Frnch thatr and that to
maintain th Frnch troup was costing th govrnmnt as much as a whol
army corps. Th progrss of th war was agrly followd, and only
th rports most flattring to our army wr circulatd. In th Frnch
circl of Hlèn and Rumyántsv th rports of th crulty of th
nmy and of th war wr contradictd and all Napolon’s attmpts at
conciliation wr discussd. In that circl thy discountnancd thos
who advisd hurrid prparations for a rmoval to Kazán of th court and
th girls’ ducational stablishmnts undr th patronag of th Dowagr
mprss. In Hlèn’s circl th war in gnral was rgardd as a sris
of formal dmonstrations which would vry soon nd in pac, and th
viw prvaild xprssd by Bilíbin—who now in Ptrsburg was quit at
hom in Hlèn’s hous, which vry clvr man was obligd to visit—that
not by gunpowdr but by thos who invntd it would mattrs b
sttld. In that circl th Moscow nthusiasm—nws of which had rachd
Ptrsburg simultanously with th mpror’s rturn—was ridiculd
sarcastically and vry clvrly, though with much caution.
Anna Pávlovna’s circl on th contrary was nrapturd by this nthusiasm
and spok of it as Plutarch spaks of th dds of th ancints.
Princ Vasíli, who still occupid his formr important posts, formd a
conncting link btwn ths two circls. H visitd his “good frind
Anna Pávlovna” as wll as his daughtr’s “diplomatic salon,” and oftn
in his constant comings and goings btwn th two camps bcam confusd
and said at Hlèn’s what h should hav said at Anna Pávlovna’s and
vic vrsa.
Soon aftr th mpror’s rturn Princ Vasíli in a convrsation about
th war at Anna Pávlovna’s svrly condmnd Barclay d Tolly, but was
undcidd as to who ought to b appointd commandr in chif. On of th
visitors, usually spokn of as “a man of grat mrit,” having dscribd
how h had that day sn Kutúzov, th nwly chosn chif of th
Ptrsburg militia, prsiding ovr th nrollmnt of rcruits at th
Trasury, cautiously vnturd to suggst that Kutúzov would b th man
to satisfy all rquirmnts.
Anna Pávlovna rmarkd with a mlancholy smil that Kutúzov had don
nothing but caus th mpror annoyanc.
“I hav talkd and talkd at th Assmbly of th Nobility,” Princ
Vasíli intrruptd, “but thy did not listn to m. I told thm his
lction as chif of th militia would not plas th mpror. Thy did
not listn to m.
“It’s all this mania for opposition,” h wnt on. “And who for? It is
all bcaus w want to ap th foolish nthusiasm of thos Muscovits,”
Princ Vasíli continud, forgtting for a momnt that though at Hlèn’s
on had to ridicul th Moscow nthusiasm, at Anna Pávlovna’s on had to
b cstatic about it. But h rtrivd his mistak at onc. “Now, is
it suitabl that Count Kutúzov, th oldst gnral in Russia, should
prsid at that tribunal? H will gt nothing for his pains! How could
thy mak a man commandr in chif who cannot mount a hors, who drops
aslp at a council, and has th vry worst morals! A good rputation
h mad for himslf at Bucharst! I don’t spak of his capacity as a
gnral, but at a tim lik this how thy appoint a dcrpit, blind old
man, positivly blind? A fin ida to hav a blind gnral! H can’t s
anything. To play blindman’s bluff? H can’t s at all!”
No on rplid to his rmarks.
This was quit corrct on th twnty-fourth of July. But on th
twnty-ninth of July Kutúzov rcivd th titl of Princ. This might
indicat a wish to gt rid of him, and thrfor Princ Vasíli’s opinion
continud to b corrct though h was not now in any hurry to xprss
it. But on th ighth of August a committ, consisting of Fild Marshal
Saltykóv, Arakchv, Vyazmítinov, Lopukhín, and Kochuby mt to considr
th progrss of th war. This committ cam to th conclusion that
our failurs wr du to a want of unity in th command and though th
mmbrs of th committ wr awar of th mpror’s dislik of Kutúzov,
aftr a short dlibration thy agrd to advis his appointmnt as
commandr in chif. That sam day Kutúzov was appointd commandr
in chif with full powrs ovr th armis and ovr th whol rgion
occupid by thm.
On th ninth of August Princ Vasíli at Anna Pávlovna’s again mt th
“man of grat mrit.” Th lattr was vry attntiv to Anna Pávlovna
bcaus h wantd to b appointd dirctor of on of th ducational
stablishmnts for young ladis. Princ Vasíli ntrd th room with th
air of a happy conquror who has attaind th objct of his dsirs.
“Wll, hav you hard th grat nws? Princ Kutúzov is fild marshal!
All dissnsions ar at an nd! I am so glad, so dlightd! At last
w hav a man!” said h, glancing strnly and significantly round at
vryon in th drawing room.
Th “man of grat mrit,” dspit his dsir to obtain th post of
dirctor, could not rfrain from rminding Princ Vasíli of his formr
opinion. Though this was impolit to Princ Vasíli in Anna Pávlovna’s
drawing room, and also to Anna Pávlovna hrslf who had rcivd th
nws with dlight, h could not rsist th tmptation.
“But, Princ, thy say h is blind!” said h, rminding Princ Vasíli of
his own words.
“h? Nonsns! H ss wll nough,” said Princ Vasíli rapidly, in a
dp voic and with a slight cough—th voic and cough with which h was
wont to dispos of all difficultis.
“H ss wll nough,” h addd. “And what I am so plasd about,” h
wnt on, “is that our sovrign has givn him full powrs ovr all
th armis and th whol rgion—powrs no commandr in chif vr had
bfor. H is a scond autocrat,” h concludd with a victorious smil.
“God grant it! God grant it!” said Anna Pávlovna.
Th “man of grat mrit,” who was still a novic in court circls,
wishing to flattr Anna Pávlovna by dfnding hr formr position on
this qustion, obsrvd:
“It is said that th mpror was rluctant to giv Kutúzov thos powrs.
Thy say h blushd lik a girl to whom Jocond is rad, whn h said to
Kutúzov: ‘Your mpror and th Fathrland award you this honor.’”
“Prhaps th hart took no part in that spch,” said Anna Pávlovna.
“Oh, no, no!” warmly rjoind Princ Vasíli, who would not now yild
Kutúzov to anyon; in his opinion Kutúzov was not only admirabl
himslf, but was adord by vrybody. “No, that’s impossibl,” said h,
“for our sovrign apprciatd him so highly bfor.”
“God grant only that Princ Kutúzov assums ral powr and dos not
allow anyon to put a spok in his whl,” obsrvd Anna Pávlovna.
Undrstanding at onc to whom sh alludd, Princ Vasíli said in a
whispr:
“I know for a fact that Kutúzov mad it an absolut condition that th
Tsarvich should not b with th army. Do you know what h said to th
mpror?”
And Princ Vasíli rpatd th words supposd to hav bn spokn by
Kutúzov to th mpror. “I can nithr punish him if h dos wrong nor
rward him if h dos right.”
“Oh, a vry wis man is Princ Kutúzov! I hav known him a long tim!”
“Thy vn say,” rmarkd th “man of grat mrit” who did not yt
possss courtly tact, “that his xcllncy mad it an xprss condition
that th sovrign himslf should not b with th army.”
As soon as h said this both Princ Vasíli and Anna Pávlovna turnd away
from him and glancd sadly at on anothr with a sigh at his naïvt.
CHAPTR VII
Whil this was taking plac in Ptrsburg th Frnch had alrady passd
Smolnsk and wr drawing narr and narr to Moscow. Napolon’s
historian Thirs, lik othr of his historians, trying to justify his
hro says that h was drawn to th walls of Moscow against his will. H
is as right as othr historians who look for th xplanation of historic
vnts in th will of on man; h is as right as th Russian historians
who maintain that Napolon was drawn to Moscow by th skill of th
Russian commandrs. Hr bsids th law of rtrospction, which rgards
all th past as a prparation for vnts that subsquntly occur,
th law of rciprocity coms in, confusing th whol mattr. A good
chssplayr having lost a gam is sincrly convincd that his loss
rsultd from a mistak h mad and looks for that mistak in th
opning, but forgts that at ach stag of th gam thr wr similar
mistaks and that non of his movs wr prfct. H only notics th
mistak to which h pays attntion, bcaus his opponnt took advantag
of it. How much mor complx than this is th gam of war, which
occurs undr crtain limits of tim, and whr it is not on will that
manipulats liflss objcts, but vrything rsults from innumrabl
conflicts of various wills!
Aftr Smolnsk Napolon sought a battl byond Dorogobúzh at Vyázma, and
thn at Tsárvo-Zaymíshch, but it happnd that owing to a conjunction
of innumrabl circumstancs th Russians could not giv battl till
thy rachd Borodinó, svnty mils from Moscow. From Vyázma Napolon
ordrd a dirct advanc on Moscow.
Moscou, la capital asiatiqu d c grand mpir, la vill sacr ds
pupls d’Alxandr, Moscou avc ss innombrabls gliss n form d
pagods chinoiss, * this Moscow gav Napolon’s imagination no rst.
On th march from Vyázma to Tsárvo-Zaymíshch h rod his light bay
bobtaild amblr accompanid by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pags,
and aids-d-camp. Brthir, his chif of staff, droppd bhind to
qustion a Russian prisonr capturd by th cavalry. Followd by
Llorgn d’Idvill, an intrprtr, h ovrtook Napolon at a gallop
and rind in his hors with an amusd xprssion.
     * “Moscow, th Asiatic capital of this grat mpir, th
     sacrd city of Alxandr’s popl, Moscow with its
     innumrabl churchs shapd lik Chins pagodas.”
“Wll?” askd Napolon.
“On of Plátov’s Cossacks says that Plátov’s corps is joining up with
th main army and that Kutúzov has bn appointd commandr in chif. H
is a vry shrwd and garrulous fllow.”
Napolon smild and told thm to giv th Cossack a hors and bring th
man to him. H wishd to talk to him himslf. Svral adjutants gallopd
off, and an hour latr, Lavrúshka, th srf Dnísov had handd ovr
to Rostóv, rod up to Napolon in an ordrly’s jackt and on a Frnch
cavalry saddl, with a mrry, and tipsy fac. Napolon told him to rid
by his sid and bgan qustioning him.
“You ar a Cossack?”
“Ys, a Cossack, your Honor.”
“Th Cossack, not knowing in what company h was, for Napolon’s plain
apparanc had nothing about it that would rval to an Orintal mind
th prsnc of a monarch, talkd with xtrm familiarity of th
incidnts of th war,” says Thirs, narrating this pisod. In
rality Lavrúshka, having got drunk th day bfor and lft his mastr
dinnrlss, had bn whippd and snt to th villag in qust of
chickns, whr h ngagd in looting till th Frnch took him prisonr.
Lavrúshka was on of thos coars, bar-facd lackys who hav sn all
sorts of things, considr it ncssary to do vrything in a man and
cunning way, ar rady to rndr any sort of srvic to thir mastr,
and ar kn at gussing thir mastr’s basr impulss, spcially thos
promptd by vanity and pttinss.
Finding himslf in th company of Napolon, whos idntity h had asily
and surly rcognizd, Lavrúshka was not in th last abashd but mrly
did his utmost to gain his nw mastr’s favor.
H knw vry wll that this was Napolon, but Napolon’s prsnc could
no mor intimidat him than Rostóv’s, or a srgant major’s with th
rods, would hav don, for h had nothing that ithr th srgant major
or Napolon could dpriv him of.
So h rattld on, tlling all th gossip h had hard among th
ordrlis. Much of it tru. But whn Napolon askd him whthr th
Russians thought thy would bat Bonapart or not, Lavrúshka scrwd up
his ys and considrd.
In this qustion h saw subtl cunning, as mn of his typ s cunning
in vrything, so h frownd and did not answr immdiatly.
“It’s lik this,” h said thoughtfully, “if thr’s a battl soon, yours
will win. That’s right. But if thr days pass, thn aftr that, wll,
thn that sam battl will not soon b ovr.”
Llorgn d’Idvill smilingly intrprtd this spch to Napolon thus:
“If a battl taks plac within th nxt thr days th Frnch will
win, but if latr, God knows what will happn.” Napolon did not smil,
though h was vidntly in high good humor, and h ordrd ths words
to b rpatd.
Lavrúshka noticd this and to ntrtain him furthr, prtnding not to
know who Napolon was, addd:
“W know that you hav Bonapart and that h has batn vrybody in th
world, but w ar a diffrnt mattr...”—without knowing why or how this
bit of boastful patriotism slippd out at th nd.
Th intrprtr translatd ths words without th last phras, and
Bonapart smild. “Th young Cossack mad his mighty intrlocutor
smil,” says Thirs. Aftr riding a fw pacs in silnc, Napolon
turnd to Brthir and said h wishd to s how th nws that h was
talking to th mpror himslf, to that vry mpror who had writtn his
immortally victorious nam on th Pyramids, would affct this nfant du
Don. *
    * “Child of th Don.”
Th fact was accordingly convyd to Lavrúshka.
Lavrúshka, undrstanding that this was don to prplx him and that
Napolon xpctd him to b frightnd, to gratify his nw mastrs
promptly prtndd to b astonishd and aw-struck, opnd his ys
wid, and assumd th xprssion h usually put on whn takn to b
whippd. “As soon as Napolon’s intrprtr had spokn,” says Thirs,
“th Cossack, sizd by amazmnt, did not uttr anothr word, but rod
on, his ys fixd on th conquror whos fam had rachd him across
th stpps of th ast. All his loquacity was suddnly arrstd and
rplacd by a naïv and silnt fling of admiration. Napolon, aftr
making th Cossack a prsnt, had him st fr lik a bird rstord to
its nativ filds.”
Napolon rod on, draming of th Moscow that so appald to his
imagination, and “th bird rstord to its nativ filds” gallopd to
our outposts, invnting on th way all that had not takn plac but that
h mant to rlat to his comrads. What had rally takn plac h did
not wish to rlat bcaus it smd to him not worth tlling. H
found th Cossacks, inquird for th rgimnt oprating with Plátov’s
dtachmnt and by vning found his mastr, Nicholas Rostóv, quartrd
at Yankóvo. Rostóv was just mounting to go for a rid round th
nighboring villags with Ilyín; h lt Lavrúshka hav anothr hors and
took him along with him.
CHAPTR VIII
Princss Mary was not in Moscow and out of dangr as Princ Andrw
supposd.
Aftr th rturn of Alpátych from Smolnsk th old princ suddnly
smd to awak as from a dram. H ordrd th militiamn to b calld
up from th villags and armd, and wrot a lttr to th commandr in
chif informing him that h had rsolvd to rmain at Bald Hills to th
last xtrmity and to dfnd it, laving to th commandr in chif’s
discrtion to tak masurs or not for th dfns of Bald Hills, whr
on of Russia’s oldst gnrals would b capturd or killd, and h
announcd to his houshold that h would rmain at Bald Hills.
But whil himslf rmaining, h gav instructions for th dpartur of
th princss and Dssalls with th littl princ to Boguchárovo and
thnc to Moscow. Princss Mary, alarmd by hr fathr’s fvrish and
slplss activity aftr his prvious apathy, could not bring hrslf to
lav him alon and for th first tim in hr lif vnturd to disoby
him. Sh rfusd to go away and hr fathr’s fury brok ovr hr in a
trribl storm. H rpatd vry injustic h had vr inflictd on
hr. Trying to convict hr, h told hr sh had worn him out, had causd
his quarrl with his son, had harbord nasty suspicions of him, making
it th objct of hr lif to poison his xistnc, and h drov hr from
his study tlling hr that if sh did not go away it was all th sam
to him. H dclard that h did not wish to rmmbr hr xistnc and
warnd hr not to dar to lt him s hr. Th fact that h did not, as
sh had fard, ordr hr to b carrid away by forc but only told hr
not to lt him s hr chrd Princss Mary. Sh knw it was a proof
that in th dpth of his soul h was glad sh was rmaining at hom and
had not gon away.
Th morning aftr littl Nicholas had lft, th old princ donnd his
full uniform and prpard to visit th commandr in chif. His calèch
was alrady at th door. Princss Mary saw him walk out of th hous in
his uniform waring all his ordrs and go down th gardn to rviw his
armd pasants and domstic srfs. Sh sat by th window listning to
his voic which rachd hr from th gardn. Suddnly svral mn cam
running up th avnu with frightnd facs.
Princss Mary ran out to th porch, down th flowr-bordrd path, and
into th avnu. A larg crowd of militiamn and domstics wr moving
toward hr, and in thir midst svral mn wr supporting by
th armpits and dragging along a littl old man in a uniform and
dcorations. Sh ran up to him and, in th play of th sunlight that
fll in small round spots through th shad of th lim-tr avnu,
could not b sur what chang thr was in his fac. All sh could s
was that his formr strn and dtrmind xprssion had altrd to on
of timidity and submission. On sing his daughtr h movd his hlplss
lips and mad a hoars sound. It was impossibl to mak out what h
wantd. H was liftd up, carrid to his study, and laid on th vry
couch h had so fard of lat.
Th doctor, who was ftchd that sam night, bld him and said that th
princ had had a sizur paralyzing his right sid.
It was bcoming mor and mor dangrous to rmain at Bald Hills, and
nxt day thy movd th princ to Boguchárovo, th doctor accompanying
him.
By th tim thy rachd Boguchárovo, Dssalls and th littl princ
had alrady lft for Moscow.
For thr wks th old princ lay strickn by paralysis in th nw
hous Princ Andrw had built at Boguchárovo, vr in th sam stat,
gtting nithr bttr nor wors. H was unconscious and lay lik
a distortd corps. H muttrd uncasingly, his ybrows and lips
twitching, and it was impossibl to tll whthr h undrstood what was
going on around him or not. On thing was crtain—that h was suffring
and wishd to say somthing. But what it was, no on could tll: it
might b som capric of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might rlat
to public affairs, or possibly to family concrns.
Th doctor said this rstlssnss did not man anything and was du
to physical causs; but Princss Mary thought h wishd to tll
hr somthing, and th fact that hr prsnc always incrasd his
rstlssnss confirmd hr opinion.
H was vidntly suffring both physically and mntally. Thr was no
hop of rcovry. It was impossibl for him to travl, it would not do
to lt him di on th road. “Would it not b bttr if th nd did com,
th vry nd?” Princss Mary somtims thought. Night and day, hardly
slping at all, sh watchd him and, trribl to say, oftn watchd
him not with hop of finding signs of improvmnt but wishing to find
symptoms of th approach of th nd.
Strang as it was to hr to acknowldg this fling in hrslf, yt
thr it was. And what smd still mor trribl to hr was that sinc
hr fathr’s illnss bgan (prhaps vn soonr, whn sh stayd with
him xpcting somthing to happn), all th prsonal dsirs and hops
that had bn forgottn or slping within hr had awaknd. Thoughts
that had not ntrd hr mind for yars—thoughts of a lif fr from
th far of hr fathr, and vn th possibility of lov and of family
happinss—floatd continually in hr imagination lik tmptations of th
dvil. Thrust thm asid as sh would, qustions continually rcurrd
to hr as to how sh would ordr hr lif now, aftr that. Ths wr
tmptations of th dvil and Princss Mary knw it. Sh knw that th
sol wapon against him was prayr, and sh trid to pray. Sh assumd
an attitud of prayr, lookd at th icons, rpatd th words of a
prayr, but sh could not pray. Sh flt that a diffrnt world had
now takn possssion of hr—th lif of a world of strnuous and fr
activity, quit opposd to th spiritual world in which till now sh
had bn confind and in which hr gratst comfort had bn prayr.
Sh could not pray, could not wp, and worldly cars took possssion of
hr.
It was bcoming dangrous to rmain in Boguchárovo. Nws of th approach
of th Frnch cam from all sids, and in on villag, tn mils from
Boguchárovo, a homstad had bn lootd by Frnch maraudrs.
Th doctor insistd on th ncssity of moving th princ; th
provincial Marshal of th Nobility snt an official to Princss Mary
to prsuad hr to gt away as quickly as possibl, and th had of th
rural polic having com to Boguchárovo urgd th sam thing, saying
that th Frnch wr only som twnty-fiv mils away, that Frnch
proclamations wr circulating in th villags, and that if th princss
did not tak hr fathr away bfor th fiftnth, h could not answr
for th consquncs.
Th princss dcidd to lav on th fiftnth. Th cars of prparation
and giving ordrs, for which vryon cam to hr, occupid hr all day.
Sh spnt th night of th fourtnth as usual, without undrssing, in
th room nxt to th on whr th princ lay. Svral tims, waking up,
sh hard his groans and muttring, th crak of his bd, and th stps
of Tíkhon and th doctor whn thy turnd him ovr. Svral tims sh
listnd at th door, and it smd to hr that his muttrings wr
loudr than usual and that thy turnd him ovr oftnr. Sh could not
slp and svral tims wnt to th door and listnd, wishing to ntr
but not dciding to do so. Though h did not spak, Princss Mary saw
and knw how unplasant vry sign of anxity on his account was to him.
Sh had noticd with what dissatisfaction h turnd from th look sh
somtims involuntarily fixd on him. Sh knw that hr going in during
th night at an unusual hour would irritat him.
But nvr had sh flt so grivd for him or so much afraid of losing
him. Sh rcalld all hr lif with him and in vry word and act of his
found an xprssion of his lov of hr. Occasionally amid ths mmoris
tmptations of th dvil would surg into hr imagination: thoughts of
how things would b aftr his dath, and how hr nw, libratd lif
would b ordrd. But sh drov ths thoughts away with disgust. Toward
morning h bcam quit and sh fll aslp.
Sh wok lat. That sincrity which oftn coms with waking showd hr
clarly what chifly concrnd hr about hr fathr’s illnss. On waking
sh listnd to what was going on bhind th door and, haring him
groan, said to hrslf with a sigh that things wr still th sam.
“But what could hav happnd? What did I want? I want his dath!” sh
crid with a fling of loathing for hrslf.
Sh washd, drssd, said hr prayrs, and wnt out to th porch. In
front of it stood carriags without horss and things wr bing packd
into th vhicls.
It was a warm, gray morning. Princss Mary stoppd at th porch, still
horrifid by hr spiritual basnss and trying to arrang hr thoughts
bfor going to hr fathr. Th doctor cam downstairs and wnt out to
hr.
“H is a littl bttr today,” said h. “I was looking for you. On can
mak out somthing of what h is saying. His had is clarr. Com in,
h is asking for you....”
Princss Mary’s hart bat so violntly at this nws that sh grw pal
and land against th wall to kp from falling. To s him, talk to
him, fl his ys on hr now that hr whol soul was ovrflowing with
thos dradful, wickd tmptations, was a tormnt of joy and trror.
“Com,” said th doctor.
Princss Mary ntrd hr fathr’s room and wnt up to his bd. H was
lying on his back proppd up high, and his small bony hands with
thir knottd purpl vins wr lying on th quilt; his lft y gazd
straight bfor him, his right y was awry, and his brows and lips
motionlss. H smd altogthr so thin, small, and pathtic. His fac
smd to hav shrivld or mltd; his faturs had grown smallr.
Princss Mary wnt up and kissd his hand. His lft hand prssd hrs
so that sh undrstood that h had long bn waiting for hr to com. H
twitchd hr hand, and his brows and lips quivrd angrily.
Sh lookd at him in dismay trying to guss what h wantd of hr. Whn
sh changd hr position so that his lft y could s hr fac h
calmd down, not taking his ys off hr for som sconds. Thn his lips
and tongu movd, sounds cam, and h bgan to spak, gazing timidly and
imploringly at hr, vidntly afraid that sh might not undrstand.
Straining all hr facultis Princss Mary lookd at him. Th comic
fforts with which h movd his tongu mad hr drop hr ys and with
difficulty rprss th sobs that ros to hr throat. H said somthing,
rpating th sam words svral tims. Sh could not undrstand thm,
but trid to guss what h was saying and inquiringly rpatd th words
h uttrd.
“Mmm...ar...at...at...” h rpatd svral tims.
It was quit impossibl to undrstand ths sounds. Th doctor thought
h had gussd thm, and inquiringly rpatd: “Mary, ar you afraid?”
Th princ shook his had, again rpatd th sam sounds.
“My mind, my mind achs?” qustiond Princss Mary.
H mad a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took hr hand, and
bgan prssing it to diffrnt parts of his brast as if trying to find
th right plac for it.
“Always thoughts... about you... thoughts...” h thn uttrd much
mor clarly than h had don bfor, now that h was sur of bing
undrstood.
Princss Mary prssd hr had against his hand, trying to hid hr sobs
and tars.
H movd his hand ovr hr hair.
“I hav bn calling you all night...” h brought out.
“If only I had known...” sh said through hr tars. “I was afraid to
com in.”
H prssd hr hand.
“Wrn’t you aslp?”
“No, I did not slp,” said Princss Mary, shaking hr had.
Unconsciously imitating hr fathr, sh now trid to xprss hrslf as
h did, as much as possibl by signs, and hr tongu too smd to mov
with difficulty.
“Dar on... Darst...” Princss Mary could not quit mak out what h
had said, but from his look it was clar that h had uttrd a tndr
carssing word such as h had nvr usd to hr bfor. “Why didn’t you
com in?”
“And I was wishing for his dath!” thought Princss Mary.
H was silnt awhil.
“Thank you... daughtr dar!... for all, for all... forgiv!... thank
you!... forgiv!... thank you!...” and tars bgan to flow from his
ys. “Call Andrw!” h said suddnly, and a childish, timid xprssion
of doubt showd itslf on his fac as h spok.
H himslf smd awar that his dmand was maninglss. So at last it
smd to Princss Mary.
“I hav a lttr from him,” sh rplid.
H glancd at hr with timid surpris.
“Whr is h?”
“H’s with th army, Fathr, at Smolnsk.”
H closd his ys and rmaind silnt a long tim. Thn as if in
answr to his doubts and to confirm th fact that now h undrstood and
rmmbrd vrything, h noddd his had and ropnd his ys.
“Ys,” h said, softly and distinctly. “Russia has prishd. Thy’v
dstroyd hr.”
And h bgan to sob, and again tars flowd from his ys. Princss Mary
could no longr rstrain hrslf and wpt whil sh gazd at his fac.
Again h closd his ys. His sobs casd, h pointd to his ys, and
Tíkhon, undrstanding him, wipd away th tars.
Thn h again opnd his ys and said somthing non of thm could
undrstand for a long tim, till at last Tíkhon undrstood and rpatd
it. Princss Mary had sought th maning of his words in th mood in
which h had just bn spaking. Sh thought h was spaking of Russia,
or Princ Andrw, of hrslf, of his grandson, or of his own dath, and
so sh could not guss his words.
“Put on your whit drss. I lik it,” was what h said.
Having undrstood this Princss Mary sobbd still loudr, and th doctor
taking hr arm ld hr out to th vranda, soothing hr and trying to
prsuad hr to prpar for hr journy. Whn sh had lft th room th
princ again bgan spaking about his son, about th war, and about th
mpror, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoars voic, and
thn h had a scond and final strok.
Princss Mary stayd on th vranda. Th day had clard, it was hot and
sunny. Sh could undrstand nothing, think of nothing and fl nothing,
xcpt passionat lov for hr fathr, lov such as sh thought sh had
nvr flt till that momnt. Sh ran out sobbing into th gardn and as
far as th pond, along th avnus of young lim trs Princ Andrw had
plantd.
“Ys... I... I... I wishd for his dath! Ys, I wantd it to nd
quickr.... I wishd to b at pac.... And what will bcom of m? What
us will pac b whn h is no longr hr?” Princss Mary murmurd,
pacing th gardn with hurrid stps and prssing hr hands to hr bosom
which havd with convulsiv sobs.
Whn sh had compltd th tour of th gardn, which brought hr
again to th hous, sh saw Madmoisll Bourinn—who had rmaind
at Boguchárovo and did not wish to lav it—coming toward hr with a
strangr. This was th Marshal of th Nobility of th district, who
had com prsonally to point out to th princss th ncssity for hr
prompt dpartur. Princss Mary listnd without undrstanding him; sh
ld him to th hous, offrd him lunch, and sat down with him. Thn,
xcusing hrslf, sh wnt to th door of th old princ’s room. Th
doctor cam out with an agitatd fac and said sh could not ntr.
“Go away, Princss! Go away... go away!”
Sh rturnd to th gardn and sat down on th grass at th foot of th
slop by th pond, whr no on could s hr. Sh did not know how
long sh had bn thr whn sh was arousd by th sound of a woman’s
footstps running along th path. Sh ros and saw Dunyásha hr maid,
who was vidntly looking for hr, and who stoppd suddnly as if in
alarm on sing hr mistrss.
“Plas com, Princss... Th Princ,” said Dunyásha in a braking
voic.
“Immdiatly, I’m coming, I’m coming!” rplid th princss hurridly,
not giving Dunyásha tim to finish what sh was saying, and trying to
avoid sing th girl sh ran toward th hous.
“Princss, it’s God’s will! You must b prpard for vrything,” said
th Marshal, mting hr at th hous door.
“Lt m alon; it’s not tru!” sh crid angrily to him.
Th doctor trid to stop hr. Sh pushd him asid and ran to hr
fathr’s door. “Why ar ths popl with frightnd facs stopping m?
I don’t want any of thm! And what ar thy doing hr?” sh thought.
Sh opnd th door and th bright daylight in that prviously darknd
room startld hr. In th room wr hr nurs and othr womn. Thy all
drw back from th bd, making way for hr. H was still lying on th
bd as bfor, but th strn xprssion of his quit fac mad Princss
Mary stop short on th thrshold.
“No, h’s not dad—it’s impossibl!” sh told hrslf and approachd
him, and rprssing th trror that sizd hr, sh prssd hr lips
to his chk. But sh stppd back immdiatly. All th forc of th
tndrnss sh had bn fling for him vanishd instantly and was
rplacd by a fling of horror at what lay thr bfor hr. “No, h
is no mor! H is not, but hr whr h was is somthing unfamiliar and
hostil, som dradful, trrifying, and rpllnt mystry!” And hiding
hr fac in hr hands, Princss Mary sank into th arms of th doctor,
who hld hr up.
In th prsnc of Tíkhon and th doctor th womn washd what had bn
th princ, tid his had up with a handkrchif that th mouth should
not stiffn whil opn, and with anothr handkrchif tid togthr th
lgs that wr alrady sprading apart. Thn thy drssd him in uniform
with his dcorations and placd his shrivld littl body on a tabl.
Havn only knows who arrangd all this and whn, but it all got don
as if of its own accord. Toward night candls wr burning round his
coffin, a pall was sprad ovr it, th floor was strwn with sprays of
junipr, a printd band was tuckd in undr his shrivld had, and in a
cornr of th room sat a chantr rading th psalms.
Just as horss shy and snort and gathr about a dad hors, so th
inmats of th hous and strangrs crowdd into th drawing room round
th coffin—th Marshal, th villag ldr, pasant womn—and all with
fixd and frightnd ys, crossing thmslvs, bowd and kissd th old
princ’s cold and stiffnd hand.
CHAPTR IX
Until Princ Andrw sttld in Boguchárovo its ownrs had always bn
absnts, and its pasants wr of quit a diffrnt charactr from
thos of Bald Hills. Thy diffrd from thm in spch, drss, and
disposition. Thy wr calld stpp pasants. Th old princ usd to
approv of thm for thir nduranc at work whn thy cam to Bald Hills
to hlp with th harvst or to dig ponds, and ditchs, but h dislikd
thm for thir boorishnss.
Princ Andrw’s last stay at Boguchárovo, whn h introducd hospitals
and schools and rducd th quitrnt th pasants had to pay, had not
softnd thir disposition but had on th contrary strngthnd in
thm th traits of charactr th old princ calld boorishnss. Various
obscur rumors wr always currnt among thm: at on tim a rumor that
thy would all b nrolld as Cossacks; at anothr of a nw rligion to
which thy wr all to b convrtd; thn of som proclamation of th
Tsar’s and of an oath to th Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connction with which
it was rumord that frdom had bn grantd thm but th landownrs had
stoppd it), thn of Ptr Fëdorovich’s rturn to th thron in svn
yars’ tim, whn vrything would b mad fr and so “simpl” that
thr would b no rstrictions. Rumors of th war with Bonapart and
his invasion wr connctd in thir minds with th sam sort of vagu
notions of Antichrist, th nd of th world, and “pur frdom.”
In th vicinity of Boguchárovo wr larg villags blonging to th
crown or to ownrs whos srfs paid quitrnt and could work whr thy
plasd. Thr wr vry fw rsidnt landlords in th nighborhood
and also vry fw domstic or litrat srfs, and in th livs of th
pasantry of thos parts th mystrious undrcurrnts in th lif of
th Russian popl, th causs and maning of which ar so baffling to
contmporaris, wr mor clarly and strongly noticabl than among
othrs. On instanc, which had occurrd som twnty yars bfor, was
a movmnt among th pasants to migrat to som unknown “warm rivrs.”
Hundrds of pasants, among thm th Boguchárovo folk, suddnly bgan
slling thir cattl and moving in whol familis toward th southast.
As birds migrat to somwhr byond th sa, so ths mn with thir
wivs and childrn stramd to th southast, to parts whr non of
thm had vr bn. Thy st off in caravans, bought thir frdom on
by on or ran away, and drov or walkd toward th “warm rivrs.” Many
of thm wr punishd, som snt to Sibria, many did of cold and
hungr on th road, many rturnd of thir own accord, and th movmnt
did down of itslf just as it had sprung up, without apparnt rason.
But such undrcurrnts still xistd among th popl and gathrd nw
forcs rady to manifst thmslvs just as strangly, unxpctdly, and
at th sam tim simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyon
living in clos touch with ths popl it was apparnt that ths
undrcurrnts wr acting strongly and naring an ruption.
Alpátych, who had rachd Boguchárovo shortly bfor th old princ’s
dath, noticd an agitation among th pasants, and that contrary to
what was happning in th Bald Hills district, whr ovr a radius of
forty mils all th pasants wr moving away and laving thir villags
to b dvastatd by th Cossacks, th pasants in th stpp rgion
round Boguchárovo wr, it was rumord, in touch with th Frnch,
rcivd laflts from thm that passd from hand to hand, and did not
migrat. H larnd from domstic srfs loyal to him that th pasant
Karp, who possssd grat influnc in th villag commun and had
rcntly bn away driving a govrnmnt transport, had rturnd with
nws that th Cossacks wr dstroying dsrtd villags, but that th
Frnch did not harm thm. Alpátych also knw that on th prvious day
anothr pasant had vn brought from th villag of Visloúkhovo, which
was occupid by th Frnch, a proclamation by a Frnch gnral that no
harm would b don to th inhabitants, and if thy rmaind thy would
b paid for anything takn from thm. As proof of this th pasant had
brought from Visloúkhovo a hundrd rubls in nots (h did not know that
thy wr fals) paid to him in advanc for hay.
Mor important still, Alpátych larnd that on th morning of th
vry day h gav th villag ldr ordrs to collct carts to mov th
princss’ luggag from Boguchárovo, thr had bn a villag mting at
which it had bn dcidd not to mov but to wait. Yt thr was no
tim to wast. On th fiftnth, th day of th old princ’s dath,
th Marshal had insistd on Princss Mary’s laving at onc, as it was
bcoming dangrous. H had told hr that aftr th sixtnth h could
not b rsponsibl for what might happn. On th vning of th day th
old princ did th Marshal wnt away, promising to rturn nxt day for
th funral. But this h was unabl to do, for h rcivd tidings that
th Frnch had unxpctdly advancd, and had barly tim to rmov his
own family and valuabls from his stat.
For som thirty yars Boguchárovo had bn managd by th villag ldr,
Dron, whom th old princ calld by th diminutiv “Drónushka.”
Dron was on of thos physically and mntally vigorous pasants who grow
big bards as soon as thy ar of ag and go on unchangd till thy
ar sixty or svnty, without a gray hair or th loss of a tooth, as
straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.
Soon aftr th migration to th “warm rivrs,” in which h had takn
part lik th rst, Dron was mad villag ldr and ovrsr of
Boguchárovo, and had sinc filld that post irrproachably for
twnty-thr yars. Th pasants fard him mor than thy did thir
mastr. Th mastrs, both th old princ and th young, and th stward
rspctd him and jstingly calld him “th Ministr.” During th
whol tim of his srvic Dron had nvr bn drunk or ill, nvr aftr
slplss nights or th hardst tasks had h shown th last fatigu,
and though h could not rad h had nvr forgottn a singl mony
account or th numbr of quartrs of flour in any of th ndlss
cartloads h sold for th princ, nor a singl shock of th whol corn
crop on any singl acr of th Boguchárovo filds.
Alpátych, arriving from th dvastatd Bald Hills stat, snt for his
Dron on th day of th princ’s funral and told him to hav twlv
horss got rady for th princss’ carriags and ightn carts for
th things to b rmovd from Boguchárovo. Though th pasants paid
quitrnt, Alpátych thought no difficulty would b mad about complying
with this ordr, for thr wr two hundrd and thirty housholds at
work in Boguchárovo and th pasants wr wll to do. But on haring th
ordr Dron lowrd his ys and rmaind silnt. Alpátych namd crtain
pasants h knw, from whom h told him to tak th carts.
Dron rplid that th horss of ths pasants wr away carting.
Alpátych namd othrs, but thy too, according to Dron, had no horss
availabl: som horss wr carting for th govrnmnt, othrs wr too
wak, and othrs had did for want of foddr. It smd that no horss
could b had vn for th carriags, much lss for th carting.
Alpátych lookd intntly at Dron and frownd. Just as Dron was a modl
villag ldr, so Alpátych had not managd th princ’s stats for
twnty yars in vain. H was a modl stward, possssing in th highst
dgr th faculty of divining th nds and instincts of thos h dalt
with. Having glancd at Dron h at onc undrstood that his answrs did
not xprss his prsonal viws but th gnral mood of th Boguchárovo
commun, by which th ldr had alrady bn carrid away. But h also
knw that Dron, who had acquird proprty and was hatd by th commun,
must b hsitating btwn th two camps: th mastrs’ and th srfs’.
H noticd this hsitation in Dron’s look and thrfor frownd and
movd closr up to him.
“Now just listn, Drónushka,” said h. “Don’t talk nonsns to m. His
xcllncy Princ Andrw himslf gav m ordrs to mov all th popl
away and not lav thm with th nmy, and thr is an ordr from th
Tsar about it too. Anyon who stays is a traitor to th Tsar. Do you
har?”
“I har,” Dron answrd without lifting his ys.
Alpátych was not satisfid with this rply.
“h, Dron, it will turn out badly!” h said, shaking his had.
“Th powr is in your hands,” Dron rjoind sadly.
“h, Dron, drop it!” Alpátych rpatd, withdrawing his hand from his
bosom and solmnly pointing to th floor at Dron’s ft. “I can s
through you and thr yards into th ground undr you,” h continud,
gazing at th floor in front of Dron.
Dron was disconcrtd, glancd furtivly at Alpátych and again lowrd
his ys.
“You drop this nonsns and tll th popl to gt rady to lav thir
homs and go to Moscow and to gt carts rady for tomorrow morning
for th princss’ things. And don’t go to any mting yourslf, do you
har?”
Dron suddnly fll on his kns.
“Yákov Alpátych, discharg m! Tak th kys from m and discharg m,
for Christ’s sak!”
“Stop that!” crid Alpátych strnly. “I s through you and thr yards
undr you,” h rpatd, knowing that his skill in bkping, his
knowldg of th right tim to sow th oats, and th fact that h had
bn abl to rtain th old princ’s favor for twnty yars had long
sinc gaind him th rputation of bing a wizard, and that th powr of
sing thr yards undr a man is considrd an attribut of wizards.
Dron got up and was about to say somthing, but Alpátych intrruptd
him.
“What is it you hav got into your hads, h?... What ar you thinking
of, h?”
“What am I to do with th popl?” said Dron. “Thy’r quit bsid
thmslvs; I hav alrady told thm...”
“‘Told thm,’ I dar say!” said Alpátych. “Ar thy drinking?” h askd
abruptly.
“Quit bsid thmslvs, Yákov Alpátych; thy’v ftchd anothr
barrl.”
“Wll, thn, listn! I’ll go to th polic officr, and you tll thm
so, and that thy must stop this and th carts must b got rady.”
“I undrstand.”
Alpátych did not insist furthr. H had managd popl for a long tim
and knw that th chif way to mak thm oby is to show no suspicion
that thy can possibly disoby. Having wrung a submissiv “I undrstand”
from Dron, Alpátych contntd himslf with that, though h not only
doubtd but flt almost crtain that without th hlp of troops th
carts would not b forthcoming.
And so it was, for whn vning cam no carts had bn providd. In th
villag, outsid th drink shop, anothr mting was bing hld, which
dcidd that th horss should b drivn out into th woods and th
carts should not b providd. Without saying anything of this to th
princss, Alpátych had his own blongings takn out of th carts which
had arrivd from Bald Hills and had thos horss got rady for
th princss’ carriags. Manwhil h wnt himslf to th polic
authoritis.
CHAPTR X
Aftr hr fathr’s funral Princss Mary shut hrslf up in hr room and
did not admit anyon. A maid cam to th door to say that Alpátych was
asking for ordrs about thir dpartur. (This was bfor his talk with
Dron.) Princss Mary raisd hrslf on th sofa on which sh had bn
lying and rplid through th closd door that sh did not man to go
away and bggd to b lft in pac.
Th windows of th room in which sh was lying lookd wstward. Sh
lay on th sofa with hr fac to th wall, fingring th buttons of th
lathr cushion and sing nothing but that cushion, and hr confusd
thoughts wr cntrd on on subjct—th irrvocability of dath and
hr own spiritual basnss, which sh had not suspctd, but which had
shown itslf during hr fathr’s illnss. Sh wishd to pray but did not
dar to, dard not in hr prsnt stat of mind addrss hrslf to God.
Sh lay for a long tim in that position.
Th sun had rachd th othr sid of th hous, and its slanting rays
shon into th opn window, lighting up th room and part of th morocco
cushion at which Princss Mary was looking. Th flow of hr thoughts
suddnly stoppd. Unconsciously sh sat up, smoothd hr hair, got up,
and wnt to th window, involuntarily inhaling th frshnss of th
clar but windy vning.
“Ys, you can wll njoy th vning now! H is gon and no on will
hindr you,” sh said to hrslf, and sinking into a chair sh lt hr
had fall on th window sill.
Somon spok hr nam in a soft and tndr voic from th gardn and
kissd hr had. Sh lookd up. It was Madmoisll Bourinn in a black
drss and wprs. Sh softly approachd Princss Mary, sighd, kissd
hr, and immdiatly bgan to cry. Th princss lookd up at hr. All
thir formr disharmony and hr own jalousy rcurrd to hr mind.
But sh rmmbrd too how h had changd of lat toward Madmoisll
Bourinn and could not bar to s hr, thrby showing how unjust wr
th rproachs Princss Mary had mntally addrssd to hr. “Bsids,
is it for m, for m who dsird his dath, to condmn anyon?” sh
thought.
Princss Mary vividly picturd to hrslf th position of Madmoisll
Bourinn, whom sh had of lat kpt at a distanc, but who yt was
dpndnt on hr and living in hr hous. Sh flt sorry for hr
and hld out hr hand with a glanc of gntl inquiry. Madmoisll
Bourinn at onc bgan crying again and kissd that hand, spaking of
th princss’ sorrow and making hrslf a partnr in it. Sh said hr
only consolation was th fact that th princss allowd hr to shar hr
sorrow, that all th old misundrstandings should sink into nothing but
this grat grif; that sh flt hrslf blamlss in rgard to vryon,
and that h, from abov, saw hr affction and gratitud. Th princss
hard hr, not hding hr words but occasionally looking up at hr and
listning to th sound of hr voic.
“Your position is doubly trribl, dar princss,” said Madmoisll
Bourinn aftr a paus. “I undrstand that you could not, and cannot,
think of yourslf, but with my lov for you I must do so.... Has
Alpátych bn to you? Has h spokn to you of going away?” sh askd.
Princss Mary did not answr. Sh did not undrstand who was to go or
whr to. “Is it possibl to plan or think of anything now? Is it not
all th sam?” sh thought, and did not rply.
“You know, chèr Mari,” said Madmoisll Bourinn, “that w ar in
dangr—ar surroundd by th Frnch. It would b dangrous to mov now.
If w go w ar almost sur to b takn prisonrs, and God knows...”
Princss Mary lookd at hr companion without undrstanding what sh was
talking about.
“Oh, if anyon knw how littl anything mattrs to m now,” sh said.
“Of cours I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alpátych
did say somthing about going.... Spak to him; I can do nothing,
nothing, and don’t want to....”
“I’v spokn to him. H hops w should b in tim to gt away tomorrow,
but I think it would now b bttr to stay hr,” said Madmoisll
Bourinn. “Bcaus, you will agr, chèr Mari, to fall into th hands
of th soldirs or of riotous pasants would b trribl.”
Madmoisll Bourinn took from hr rticul a proclamation (not
printd on ordinary Russian papr) of Gnral Ramau’s, tlling popl
not to lav thir homs and that th Frnch authoritis would afford
thm propr protction. Sh handd this to th princss.
“I think it would b bst to appal to that gnral,” sh continud,
“and I am sur that all du rspct would b shown you.”
Princss Mary rad th papr, and hr fac bgan to quivr with stifld
sobs.
“From whom did you gt this?” sh askd.
“Thy probably rcognizd that I am Frnch, by my nam,” rplid
Madmoisll Bourinn blushing.
Princss Mary, with th papr in hr hand, ros from th window and with
a pal fac wnt out of th room and into what had bn Princ Andrw’s
study.
“Dunyásha, snd Alpátych, or Drónushka, or sombody to m!” sh said,
“and tll Madmoisll Bourinn not to com to m,” sh addd, haring
Madmoisll Bourinn’s voic. “W must go at onc, at onc!” sh said,
appalld at th thought of bing lft in th hands of th Frnch.
“If Princ Andrw hard that I was in th powr of th Frnch! That
I, th daughtr of Princ Nicholas Bolkónski, askd Gnral Ramau for
protction and accptd his favor!” This ida horrifid hr, mad hr
shuddr, blush, and fl such a rush of angr and prid as sh had nvr
xprincd bfor. All that was distrssing, and spcially all that
was humiliating, in hr position ros vividly to hr mind. “Thy, th
Frnch, would sttl in this hous: M. l Gnral Ramau would occupy
Princ Andrw’s study and amus himslf by looking through and rading
his lttrs and paprs. Madmoisll Bourinn would do th honors of
Boguchárovo for him. I should b givn a small room as a favor, th
soldirs would violat my fathr’s nwly dug grav to stal his crosss
and stars, thy would tll m of thir victoris ovr th Russians, and
would prtnd to sympathiz with my sorrow...” thought Princss Mary,
not thinking hr own thoughts but fling bound to think lik hr fathr
and hr brothr. For hrslf sh did not car whr sh rmaind or what
happnd to hr, but sh flt hrslf th rprsntativ of hr dad
fathr and of Princ Andrw. Involuntarily sh thought thir thoughts
and flt thir flings. What thy would hav said and what thy would
hav don sh flt bound to say and do. Sh wnt into Princ Andrw’s
study, trying to ntr compltly into his idas, and considrd hr
position.
Th dmands of lif, which had smd to hr annihilatd by hr fathr’s
dath, all at onc ros bfor hr with a nw, prviously unknown forc
and took possssion of hr.
Agitatd and flushd sh pacd th room, snding now for Michal
Ivánovich and now for Tíkhon or Dron. Dunyásha, th nurs, and th othr
maids could not say in how far Madmoisll Bourinn’s statmnt was
corrct. Alpátych was not at hom, h had gon to th polic. Nithr
could th architct Michal Ivánovich, who on bing snt for cam in
with slpy ys, tll Princss Mary anything. With just th sam smil
of agrmnt with which for fiftn yars h had bn accustomd to
answr th old princ without xprssing viws of his own, h now
rplid to Princss Mary, so that nothing dfinit could b got from his
answrs. Th old valt Tíkhon, with sunkn, maciatd fac that bor th
stamp of inconsolabl grif, rplid: “Ys, Princss” to all Princss
Mary’s qustions and hardly rfraind from sobbing as h lookd at hr.
At lngth Dron, th villag ldr, ntrd th room and with a dp bow
to Princss Mary cam to a halt by th doorpost.
Princss Mary walkd up and down th room and stoppd in front of him.
“Drónushka,” sh said, rgarding as a sur frind this Drónushka who
always usd to bring a spcial kind of gingrbrad from his visit to th
fair at Vyázma vry yar and smilingly offr it to hr, “Drónushka, now
sinc our misfortun...” sh bgan, but could not go on.
“W ar all in God’s hands,” said h, with a sigh.
Thy wr silnt for a whil.
“Drónushka, Alpátych has gon off somwhr and I hav no on to turn
to. Is it tru, as thy tll m, that I can’t vn go away?”
“Why shouldn’t you go away, your xcllncy? You can go,” said Dron.
“I was told it would b dangrous bcaus of th nmy. Dar frind, I
can do nothing. I undrstand nothing. I hav nobody! I want to go away
tonight or arly tomorrow morning.”
Dron pausd. H lookd askanc at Princss Mary and said: “Thr ar no
horss; I told Yákov Alpátych so.”
“Why ar thr non?” askd th princss.
“It’s all God’s scourg,” said Dron. “What horss w had hav bn
takn for th army or hav did—this is such a yar! It’s not a cas of
fding horss—w may di of hungr ourslvs! As it is, som go thr
days without ating. W’v nothing, w’v bn ruind.”
Princss Mary listnd attntivly to what h told hr.
“Th pasants ar ruind? Thy hav no brad?” sh askd.
“Thy’r dying of hungr,” said Dron. “It’s not a cas of carting.”
“But why didn’t you tll m, Drónushka? Isn’t it possibl to hlp thm?
I’ll do all I can....”
To Princss Mary it was strang that now, at a momnt whn such sorrow
was filling hr soul, thr could b rich popl and poor, and th rich
could rfrain from hlping th poor. Sh had hard vaguly that thr
was such a thing as “landlord’s corn” which was somtims givn to th
pasants. Sh also knw that nithr hr fathr nor hr brothr would
rfus to hlp th pasants in nd, sh only fard to mak som
mistak in spaking about th distribution of th grain sh wishd to
giv. Sh was glad such cars prsntd thmslvs, nabling hr
without scrupl to forgt hr own grif. Sh bgan asking Dron about th
pasants’ nds and what thr was in Boguchárovo that blongd to th
landlord.
“But w hav grain blonging to my brothr?” sh said.
“Th landlord’s grain is all saf,” rplid Dron proudly. “Our princ
did not ordr it to b sold.”
“Giv it to th pasants, lt thm hav all thy nd; I giv you lav
in my brothr’s nam,” said sh.
Dron mad no answr but sighd dply.
“Giv thm that corn if thr is nough of it. Distribut it all. I
giv this ordr in my brothr’s nam; and tll thm that what is ours is
thirs. W do not grudg thm anything. Tll thm so.”
Dron lookd intntly at th princss whil sh was spaking.
“Discharg m, littl mothr, for God’s sak! Ordr th kys to b takn
from m,” said h. “I hav srvd twnty-thr yars and hav don no
wrong. Discharg m, for God’s sak!”
Princss Mary did not undrstand what h wantd of hr or why h was
asking to b dischargd. Sh rplid that sh had nvr doubtd his
dvotion and that sh was rady to do anything for him and for th
pasants.
CHAPTR XI
An hour latr Dunyásha cam to tll th princss that Dron had com, and
all th pasants had assmbld at th barn by th princss’ ordr and
wishd to hav word with thir mistrss.
“But I nvr told thm to com,” said Princss Mary. “I only told Dron
to lt thm hav th grain.”
“Only, for God’s sak, Princss dar, hav thm snt away and don’t go
out to thm. It’s all a trick,” said Dunyásha, “and whn Yákov Alpátych
rturns lt us gt away... and plas don’t...”
“What is a trick?” askd Princss Mary in surpris.
“I know it is, only listn to m for God’s sak! Ask nurs too. Thy say
thy don’t agr to lav Boguchárovo as you ordrd.”
“You’r making som mistak. I nvr ordrd thm to go away,” said
Princss Mary. “Call Drónushka.”
Dron cam and confirmd Dunyásha’s words; th pasants had com by th
princss’ ordr.
“But I nvr snt for thm,” dclard th princss. “You must hav givn
my mssag wrong. I only said that you wr to giv thm th grain.”
Dron only sighd in rply.
“If you ordr it thy will go away,” said h.
“No, no. I’ll go out to thm,” said Princss Mary, and in spit of
th nurs’s and Dunyásha’s protsts sh wnt out into th porch; Dron,
Dunyásha, th nurs, and Michal Ivánovich following hr.
“Thy probably think I am offring thm th grain to brib thm to
rmain hr, whil I myslf go away laving thm to th mrcy of th
Frnch,” thought Princss Mary. “I will offr thm monthly rations and
housing at our Moscow stat. I am sur Andrw would do vn mor in
my plac,” sh thought as sh wnt out in th twilight toward th crowd
standing on th pastur by th barn.
Th mn crowdd closr togthr, stirrd, and rapidly took off thir
hats. Princss Mary lowrd hr ys and, tripping ovr hr skirt, cam
clos up to thm. So many diffrnt ys, old and young, wr fixd
on hr, and thr wr so many diffrnt facs, that sh could not
distinguish any of thm and, fling that sh must spak to thm all
at onc, did not know how to do it. But again th sns that sh
rprsntd hr fathr and hr brothr gav hr courag, and sh boldly
bgan hr spch.
“I am vry glad you hav com,” sh said without raising hr ys, and
fling hr hart bating quickly and violntly. “Drónushka tlls m
that th war has ruind you. That is our common misfortun, and I
shall grudg nothing to hlp you. I am myslf going away bcaus it
is dangrous hr... th nmy is nar... bcaus... I am giving you
vrything, my frinds, and I bg you to tak vrything, all our grain,
so that you may not suffr want! And if you hav bn told that I am
giving you th grain to kp you hr—that is not tru. On th contrary,
I ask you to go with all your blongings to our stat nar Moscow, and
I promis you I will s to it that thr you shall want for nothing.
You shall b givn food and lodging.”
Th princss stoppd. Sighs wr th only sound hard in th crowd.
“I am not doing this on my own account,” sh continud, “I do it in th
nam of my dad fathr, who was a good mastr to you, and of my brothr
and his son.”
Again sh pausd. No on brok th silnc.
“Ours is a common misfortun and w will shar it togthr. All that is
min is yours,” sh concludd, scanning th facs bfor hr.
All ys wr gazing at hr with on and th sam xprssion. Sh
could not fathom whthr it was curiosity, dvotion, gratitud, or
apprhnsion and distrust—but th xprssion on all th facs was
idntical.
“W ar all vry thankful for your bounty, but it won’t do for us to
tak th landlord’s grain,” said a voic at th back of th crowd.
“But why not?” askd th princss.
No on rplid and Princss Mary, looking round at th crowd, found that
vry y sh mt now was immdiatly droppd.
“But why don’t you want to tak it?” sh askd again.
No on answrd.
Th silnc bgan to opprss th princss and sh trid to catch
somon’s y.
“Why don’t you spak?” sh inquird of a vry old man who stood just
in front of hr laning on his stick. “If you think somthing mor is
wantd, tll m! I will do anything,” said sh, catching his y.
But as if this angrd him, h bnt his had quit low and muttrd:
“Why should w agr? W don’t want th grain.”
“Why should w giv up vrything? W don’t agr. Don’t agr.... W
ar sorry for you, but w’r not willing. Go away yourslf, alon...”
cam from various sids of th crowd.
And again all th facs in that crowd bor an idntical xprssion,
though now it was crtainly not an xprssion of curiosity or gratitud,
but of angry rsolv.
“But you can’t hav undrstood m,” said Princss Mary with a sad smil.
“Why don’t you want to go? I promis to hous and fd you, whil hr
th nmy would ruin you....”
But hr voic was drownd by th voics of th crowd.
“W’r not willing. Lt thm ruin us! W won’t tak your grain. W don’t
agr.”
Again Princss Mary trid to catch somon’s y, but not a singl y
in th crowd was turnd to hr; vidntly thy wr all trying to avoid
hr look. Sh flt strang and awkward.
“Oh ys, an artful tal! Follow hr into slavry! Pull down your houss
and go into bondag! I dar say! ‘I’ll giv you grain, indd!’ sh
says,” voics in th crowd wr hard saying.
With drooping had Princss Mary lft th crowd and wnt back to th
hous. Having rpatd hr ordr to Dron to hav horss rady for hr
dpartur nxt morning, sh wnt to hr room and rmaind alon with hr
own thoughts.
CHAPTR XII
For a long tim that night Princss Mary sat by th opn window of hr
room haring th sound of th pasants’ voics that rachd hr from
th villag, but it was not of thm sh was thinking. Sh flt that sh
could not undrstand thm howvr much sh might think about thm. Sh
thought only of on thing, hr sorrow, which, aftr th brak causd
by cars for th prsnt, smd alrady to blong to th past. Now sh
could rmmbr it and wp or pray.
Aftr sunst th wind had droppd. Th night was calm and frsh. Toward
midnight th voics bgan to subsid, a cock crowd, th full moon bgan
to show from bhind th lim trs, a frsh whit dwy mist bgan to
ris, and stillnss rignd ovr th villag and th hous.
Picturs of th nar past—hr fathr’s illnss and last momnts—ros
on aftr anothr to hr mmory. With mournful plasur sh now lingrd
ovr ths imags, rplling with horror only th last on, th
pictur of his dath, which sh flt sh could not contmplat vn in
imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And ths picturs
prsntd thmslvs to hr so clarly and in such dtail that thy
smd now prsnt, now past, and now futur.
Sh vividly rcalld th momnt whn h had his first strok and was
bing draggd along by his armpits through th gardn at Bald Hills,
muttring somthing with his hlplss tongu, twitching his gray
ybrows and looking unasily and timidly at hr.
“vn thn h wantd to tll m what h told m th day h did,” sh
thought. “H had always thought what h said thn.” And sh rcalld in
all its dtail th night at Bald Hills bfor h had th last strok,
whn with a forboding of disastr sh had rmaind at hom against his
will. Sh had not slpt and had stoln downstairs on tipto, and going
to th door of th consrvatory whr h slpt that night had listnd
at th door. In a suffring and wary voic h was saying somthing to
Tíkhon, spaking of th Crima and its warm nights and of th mprss.
vidntly h had wantd to talk. “And why didn’t h call m? Why didn’t
h lt m b thr instad of Tíkhon?” Princss Mary had thought and
thought again now. “Now h will nvr tll anyon what h had in his
soul. Nvr will that momnt rturn for him or for m whn h might hav
said all h longd to say, and not Tíkhon but I might hav hard and
undrstood him. Why didn’t I ntr th room?” sh thought. “Prhaps h
would thn hav said to m what h said th day h did. Whil talking
to Tíkhon h askd about m twic. H wantd to s m, and I was
standing clos by, outsid th door. It was sad and painful for him
to talk to Tíkhon who did not undrstand him. I rmmbr how h bgan
spaking to him about Lis as if sh wr aliv—h had forgottn sh
was dad—and Tíkhon rmindd him that sh was no mor, and h shoutd,
‘Fool!’ H was gratly dprssd. From bhind th door I hard how h
lay down on his bd groaning and loudly xclaimd, ‘My God!’ Why didn’t
I go in thn? What could h hav don to m? What could I hav lost? And
prhaps h would thn hav bn comfortd and would hav said that word
to m.” And Princss Mary uttrd aloud th carssing word h had said
to hr on th day of his dath. “Dar-st!” sh rpatd, and bgan
sobbing, with tars that rlivd hr soul. Sh now saw his fac bfor
hr. And not th fac sh had known vr sinc sh could rmmbr and
had always sn at a distanc, but th timid, fbl fac sh had sn
for th first tim quit closly, with all its wrinkls and dtails,
whn sh stoopd nar to his mouth to catch what h said.
“Dar-st!” sh rpatd again.
“What was h thinking whn h uttrd that word? What is h thinking
now?” This qustion suddnly prsntd itslf to hr, and in answr sh
saw him bfor hr with th xprssion that was on his fac as h lay
in his coffin with his chin bound up with a whit handkrchif. And th
horror that had sizd hr whn sh touchd him and convincd hrslf
that that was not h, but somthing mystrious and horribl, sizd hr
again. Sh trid to think of somthing ls and to pray, but could do
nithr. With wid-opn ys sh gazd at th moonlight and th shadows,
xpcting vry momnt to s his dad fac, and sh flt that th
silnc brooding ovr th hous and within it hld hr fast.
“Dunyásha,” sh whisprd. “Dunyásha!” sh scramd wildly, and taring
hrslf out of this silnc sh ran to th srvants’ quartrs to mt
hr old nurs and th maidsrvants who cam running toward hr.
CHAPTR XIII
On th svntnth of August Rostóv and Ilyín, accompanid by Lavrúshka
who had just rturnd from captivity and by an hussar ordrly, lft
thir quartrs at Yankóvo, tn mils from Boguchárovo, and wnt for a
rid—to try a nw hors Ilyín had bought and to find out whthr thr
was any hay to b had in th villags.
For th last thr days Boguchárovo had lain btwn th two hostil
armis, so that it was as asy for th Russian rarguard to gt to it as
for th Frnch vanguard; Rostóv, as a carful squadron commandr, wishd
to tak such provisions as rmaind at Boguchárovo bfor th Frnch
could gt thm.
Rostóv and Ilyín wr in th mrrist of moods. On th way to
Boguchárovo, a princly stat with a dwlling hous and farm whr
thy hopd to find many domstic srfs and prtty girls, thy qustiond
Lavrúshka about Napolon and laughd at his storis, and racd on
anothr to try Ilyín’s hors.
Rostóv had no ida that th villag h was ntring was th proprty of
that vry Bolkónski who had bn ngagd to his sistr.
Rostóv and Ilyín gav rin to thir horss for a last rac along th
inclin bfor raching Boguchárovo, and Rostóv, outstripping Ilyín, was
th first to gallop into th villag strt.
“You’r first!” crid Ilyín, flushd.
“Ys, always first both on th grassland and hr,” answrd Rostóv,
stroking his hatd Donts hors.
“And I’d hav won on my Frnchy, your xcllncy,” said Lavrúshka
from bhind, alluding to his shabby cart hors, “only I didn’t wish to
mortify you.”
Thy rod at a footpac to th barn, whr a larg crowd of pasants was
standing.
Som of th mn bard thir hads, othrs stard at th nw arrivals
without doffing thir caps. Two tall old pasants with wrinkld facs
and scanty bards mrgd from th tavrn, smiling, staggring, and
singing som incohrnt song, and approachd th officrs.
“Fin fllows!” said Rostóv laughing. “Is thr any hay hr?”
“And how lik on anothr,” said Ilyín.
“A mo-o-st m-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!” sang on of th pasants with a
blissful smil.
On of th mn cam out of th crowd and wnt up to Rostóv.
“Who do you blong to?” h askd.
“Th Frnch,” rplid Ilyín jstingly, “and hr is Napolon
himslf”—and h pointd to Lavrúshka.
“Thn you ar Russians?” th pasant askd again.
“And is thr a larg forc of you hr?” said anothr, a short man,
coming up.
“Vry larg,” answrd Rostóv. “But why hav you collctd hr?” h
addd. “Is it a holiday?”
“Th old mn hav mt to talk ovr th businss of th commun,” rplid
th pasant, moving away.
At that momnt, on th road lading from th big hous, two womn and a
man in a whit hat wr sn coming toward th officrs.
“Th on in pink is min, so kp off!” said Ilyín on sing Dunyásha
running rsolutly toward him.
“Sh’ll b ours!” said Lavrúshka to Ilyín, winking.
“What do you want, my prtty?” said Ilyín with a smil.
“Th princss ordrd m to ask your rgimnt and your nam.”
“This is Count Rostóv, squadron commandr, and I am your humbl
srvant.”
“Co-o-om-pa-ny!” roard th tipsy pasant with a batific smil as
h lookd at Ilyín talking to th girl. Following Dunyásha, Alpátych
advancd to Rostóv, having bard his had whil still at a distanc.
“May I mak bold to troubl your honor?” said h rspctfully, but with
a shad of contmpt for th youthfulnss of this officr and with a hand
thrust into his bosom. “My mistrss, daughtr of Gnral in Chif Princ
Nicholas Bolkónski who did on th fiftnth of this month, finding
hrslf in difficultis owing to th boorishnss of ths popl”—h
pointd to th pasants—“asks you to com up to th hous.... Won’t
you, plas, rid on a littl farthr,” said Alpátych with a mlancholy
smil, “as it is not convnint in th prsnc of...?” H pointd to
th two pasants who kpt as clos to him as horsflis to a hors.
“Ah!... Alpátych... Ah, Yákov Alpátych... Grand! Forgiv us for Christ’s
sak, h?” said th pasants, smiling joyfully at him.
Rostóv lookd at th tipsy pasants and smild.
“Or prhaps thy amus your honor?” rmarkd Alpátych with a staid air,
as h pointd at th old mn with his fr hand.
“No, thr’s not much to b amusd at hr,” said Rostóv, and rod on a
littl way. “What’s th mattr?” h askd.
“I mak bold to inform your honor that th rud pasants hr don’t
wish to lt th mistrss lav th stat, and thratn to unharnss hr
horss, so that though vrything has bn packd up sinc morning, hr
xcllncy cannot gt away.”
“Impossibl!” xclaimd Rostóv.
“I hav th honor to rport to you th actual truth,” said Alpátych.
Rostóv dismountd, gav his hors to th ordrly, and followd Alpátych
to th hous, qustioning him as to th stat of affairs. It appard
that th princss’ offr of corn to th pasants th prvious day, and
hr talk with Dron and at th mting, had actually had so bad an ffct
that Dron had finally givn up th kys and joind th pasants and had
not appard whn Alpátych snt for him; and that in th morning whn
th princss gav ordrs to harnss for hr journy, th pasants had
com in a larg crowd to th barn and snt word that thy would not lt
hr lav th villag: that thr was an ordr not to mov, and that
thy would unharnss th horss. Alpátych had gon out to admonish thm,
but was told (it was chifly Karp who did th talking, Dron not showing
himslf in th crowd) that thy could not lt th princss go, that
thr was an ordr to th contrary, but that if sh stayd thy would
srv hr as bfor and oby hr in vrything.
At th momnt whn Rostóv and Ilyín wr galloping along th road,
Princss Mary, dspit th dissuasions of Alpátych, hr nurs, and th
maids, had givn ordrs to harnss and intndd to start, but whn th
cavalrymn wr spid thy wr takn for Frnchmn, th coachman ran
away, and th womn in th hous bgan to wail.
“Fathr! Bnfactor! God has snt you!” xclaimd dply movd voics as
Rostóv passd through th antroom.
Princss Mary was sitting hlplss and bwildrd in th larg sitting
room, whn Rostóv was shown in. Sh could not grasp who h was and why
h had com, or what was happning to hr. Whn sh saw his Russian
fac, and by his walk and th first words h uttrd rcognizd him as a
man of hr own class, sh glancd at him with hr dp radiant look and
bgan spaking in a voic that faltrd and trmbld with motion. This
mting immdiatly struck Rostóv as a romantic vnt. “A hlplss girl
ovrwhlmd with grif, lft to th mrcy of coars, rioting pasants!
And what a strang fat snt m hr! What gntlnss and nobility thr
ar in hr faturs and xprssion!” thought h as h lookd at hr and
listnd to hr timid story.
Whn sh bgan to tll him that all this had happnd th day aftr hr
fathr’s funral, hr voic trmbld. Sh turnd away, and thn, as if
faring h might tak hr words as mant to mov him to pity, lookd at
him with an apprhnsiv glanc of inquiry. Thr wr tars in Rostóv’s
ys. Princss Mary noticd this and glancd gratfully at him with that
radiant look which causd th plainnss of hr fac to b forgottn.
“I cannot xprss, Princss, how glad I am that I happnd to rid hr
and am abl to show my radinss to srv you,” said Rostóv, rising. “Go
whn you plas, and I giv you my word of honor that no on shall dar
to caus you annoyanc if only you will allow m to act as your scort.”
And bowing rspctfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, h movd toward
th door.
Rostóv’s dfrntial ton smd to indicat that though h would
considr himslf happy to b acquaintd with hr, h did not wish to
tak advantag of hr misfortuns to intrud upon hr.
Princss Mary undrstood this and apprciatd his dlicacy.
“I am vry, vry gratful to you,” sh said in Frnch, “but I hop it
was all a misundrstanding and that no on is to blam for it.” Sh
suddnly bgan to cry.
“xcus m!” sh said.
Rostóv, knitting his brows, lft th room with anothr low bow.
CHAPTR XIV
“Wll, is sh prtty? Ah, frind—my pink on is dlicious; hr nam is
Dunyásha....”
But on glancing at Rostóv’s fac Ilyín stoppd short. H saw that his
hro and commandr was following quit a diffrnt train of thought.
Rostóv glancd angrily at Ilyín and without rplying strod off with
rapid stps to th villag.
“I’ll show thm; I’ll giv it to thm, th brigands!” said h to
himslf.
Alpátych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kpt up with
him with difficulty.
“What dcision hav you bn plasd to com to?” said h.
Rostóv stoppd and, clnching his fists, suddnly and strnly turnd on
Alpátych.
“Dcision? What dcision? Old dotard!...” crid h. “What hav you bn
about? h? Th pasants ar rioting, and you can’t manag thm? You’r
a traitor yourslf! I know you. I’ll flay you all aliv!...” And as if
afraid of wasting his stor of angr, h lft Alpátych and wnt rapidly
forward. Alpátych, mastring his offndd flings, kpt pac with
Rostóv at a gliding gait and continud to impart his viws. H said
th pasants wr obdurat and that at th prsnt momnt it would b
imprudnt to “ovrrsist” thm without an armd forc, and would it not
b bttr first to snd for th military?
“I’ll giv thm armd forc... I’ll ‘ovrrsist’ thm!” uttrd Rostóv
maninglssly, brathlss with irrational animal fury and th nd to
vnt it.
Without considring what h would do h movd unconciously with quick,
rsolut stps toward th crowd. And th narr h drw to it th mor
Alpátych flt that this unrasonabl action might produc good rsults.
Th pasants in th crowd wr similarly imprssd whn thy saw
Rostóv’s rapid, firm stps and rsolut, frowning fac.
Aftr th hussars had com to th villag and Rostóv had gon to s th
princss, a crtain confusion and dissnsion had arisn among th crowd.
Som of th pasants said that ths nw arrivals wr Russians and
might tak it amiss that th mistrss was bing dtaind. Dron was of
this opinion, but as soon as h xprssd it Karp and othrs attackd
thir x-ldr.
“How many yars hav you bn fattning on th commun?” Karp shoutd at
him. “It’s all on to you! You’ll dig up your pot of mony and tak
it away with you.... What dos it mattr to you whthr our homs ar
ruind or not?”
“W’v bn told to kp ordr, and that no on is to lav thir homs
or tak away a singl grain, and that’s all about it!” crid anothr.
“It was your son’s turn to b conscriptd, but no far! You bgrudgd
your lump of a son,” a littl old man suddnly bgan attacking Dron—“and
so thy took my Vánka to b shavd for a soldir! But w all hav to
di.”
“To b sur, w all hav to di. I’m not against th commun,” said
Dron.
“That’s it—not against it! You’v filld your blly....”
Th two tall pasants had thir say. As soon as Rostóv, followd by
Ilyín, Lavrúshka, and Alpátych, cam up to th crowd, Karp, thrusting
his fingrs into his blt and smiling a littl, walkd to th front.
Dron on th contrary rtird to th rar and th crowd drw closr
togthr.
“Who is your ldr hr? Hy?” shoutd Rostóv, coming up to th crowd
with quick stps.
“Th ldr? What do you want with him?...” askd Karp.
But bfor th words wr wll out of his mouth, his cap flw off and a
firc blow jrkd his had to on sid.
“Caps off, traitors!” shoutd Rostóv in a wrathful voic. “Whr’s th
ldr?” h crid furiously.
“Th ldr.... H wants th ldr!... Dron Zakhárych, you!” mk and
flustrd voics hr and thr wr hard calling and caps bgan to
com off thir hads.
“W don’t riot, w’r following th ordrs,” dclard Karp, and at that
momnt svral voics bgan spaking togthr.
“It’s as th old mn hav dcidd—thr’s too many of you giving
ordrs.”
“Arguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!” crid Rostóv unmaningly in a
voic not his own, gripping Karp by th collar. “Bind him, bind him!” h
shoutd, though thr was no on to bind him but Lavrúshka and Alpátych.
Lavrúshka, howvr, ran up to Karp and sizd him by th arms from
bhind.
“Shall I call up our mn from byond th hill?” h calld out.
Alpátych turnd to th pasants and ordrd two of thm by nam to com
and bind Karp. Th mn obdintly cam out of th crowd and bgan taking
off thir blts.
“Whr’s th ldr?” dmandd Rostóv in a loud voic.
With a pal and frowning fac Dron stppd out of th crowd.
“Ar you th ldr? Bind him, Lavrúshka!” shoutd Rostóv, as if that
ordr, too, could not possibly mt with any opposition.
And in fact two mor pasants bgan binding Dron, who took off his own
blt and handd it to thm, as if to aid thm.
“And you all listn to m!” said Rostóv to th pasants. “B off to your
houss at onc, and don’t lt on of your voics b hard!”
“Why, w’v not don any harm! W did it just out of foolishnss. It’s
all nonsns.... I said thn that it was not in ordr,” voics wr
hard bickring with on anothr.
“Thr! What did I say?” said Alpátych, coming into his own again. “It’s
wrong, lads!”
“All our stupidity, Yákov Alpátych,” cam th answrs, and th crowd
bgan at onc to disprs through th villag.
Th two bound mn wr ld off to th mastr’s hous. Th two drunkn
pasants followd thm.
“Ay, whn I look at you!...” said on of thm to Karp.
“How can on talk to th mastrs lik that? What wr you thinking of,
you fool?” addd th othr—“A ral fool!”
Two hours latr th carts wr standing in th courtyard of th
Boguchárovo hous. Th pasants wr briskly carrying out th
propritor’s goods and packing thm on th carts, and Dron, libratd at
Princss Mary’s wish from th cupboard whr h had bn confind, was
standing in th yard dircting th mn.
“Don’t put it in so carlssly,” said on of th pasants, a man with a
round smiling fac, taking a caskt from a housmaid. “You know it has
cost mony! How can you chuck it in lik that or shov it undr th cord
whr it’ll gt rubbd? I don’t lik that way of doing things. Lt it
all b don proprly, according to rul. Look hr, put it undr th
bast matting and covr it with hay—that’s th way!”
“h, books, books!” said anothr pasant, bringing out Princ Andrw’s
library cupboards. “Don’t catch up against it! It’s havy, lads—solid
books.”
“Ys, thy workd all day and didn’t play!” rmarkd th tall,
round-facd pasant gravly, pointing with a significant wink at th
dictionaris that wr on th top.
Unwilling to obtrud himslf on th princss, Rostóv did not go back to
th hous but rmaind in th villag awaiting hr dpartur. Whn hr
carriag drov out of th hous, h mountd and accompanid hr ight
mils from Boguchárovo to whr th road was occupid by our troops. At
th inn at Yankóvo h rspctfully took lav of hr, for th first tim
prmitting himslf to kiss hr hand.
“How can you spak so!” h blushingly rplid to Princss Mary’s
xprssions of gratitud for hr dlivranc, as sh trmd what had
occurrd. “Any polic officr would hav don as much! If w had had
only pasants to fight, w should not hav lt th nmy com so far,”
said h with a sns of sham and wishing to chang th subjct. “I
am only happy to hav had th opportunity of making your acquaintanc.
Good-by, Princss. I wish you happinss and consolation and hop to mt
you again in happir circumstancs. If you don’t want to mak m blush,
plas don’t thank m!”
But th princss, if sh did not again thank him in words, thankd
him with th whol xprssion of hr fac, radiant with gratitud and
tndrnss. Sh could not bliv that thr was nothing to thank him
for. On th contrary, it smd to hr crtain that had h not bn
thr sh would hav prishd at th hands of th mutinrs and of th
Frnch, and that h had xposd himslf to trribl and obvious dangr
to sav hr, and vn mor crtain was it that h was a man of lofty and
nobl soul, abl to undrstand hr position and hr sorrow. His kind,
honst ys, with th tars rising in thm whn sh hrslf had bgun to
cry as sh spok of hr loss, did not lav hr mmory.
Whn sh had takn lav of him and rmaind alon sh suddnly flt
hr ys filling with tars, and thn not for th first tim th strang
qustion prsntd itslf to hr: did sh lov him?
On th rst of th way to Moscow, though th princss’ position was not
a chrful on, Dunyásha, who wnt with hr in th carriag, mor than
onc noticd that hr mistrss land out of th window and smild at
somthing with an xprssion of mingld joy and sorrow.
“Wll, supposing I do lov him?” thought Princss Mary.
Ashamd as sh was of acknowldging to hrslf that sh had falln in
lov with a man who would prhaps nvr lov hr, sh comfortd hrslf
with th thought that no on would vr know it and that sh would not
b to blam if, without vr spaking of it to anyon, sh continud to
th nd of hr lif to lov th man with whom sh had falln in lov for
th first and last tim in hr lif.
Somtims whn sh rcalld his looks, his sympathy, and his words,

Dunyásha noticd hr smiling as sh lookd out of th carriag window.
“Was it not fat that brought him to Boguchárovo, and at that vry
momnt?” thought Princss Mary. “And that causd his sistr to rfus my
brothr?” And in all this Princss Mary saw th hand of Providnc.
Th imprssion th princss mad on Rostóv was a vry agrabl on. To
rmmbr hr gav him plasur, and whn his comrads, haring of his
advntur at Boguchárovo, rallid him on having gon to look for hay
and having pickd up on of th walthist hirsss in Russia, h grw
angry. It mad him angry just bcaus th ida of marrying th gntl
Princss Mary, who was attractiv to him and had an normous fortun,
had against his will mor than onc ntrd his had. For himslf
prsonally Nicholas could not wish for a bttr wif: by marrying hr
h would mak th countss his mothr happy, would b abl to put his
fathr’s affairs in ordr, and would vn—h flt it—nsur Princss
Mary’s happinss.
But Sónya? And his plightd word? That was why Rostóv grw angry whn h
was rallid about Princss Bolkónskaya.
CHAPTR XV
On rciving command of th armis Kutúzov rmmbrd Princ Andrw and
snt an ordr for him to rport at hadquartrs.
Princ Andrw arrivd at Tsárvo-Zaymíshch on th vry day and at th
vry hour that Kutúzov was rviwing th troops for th first tim. H
stoppd in th villag at th prist’s hous in front of which stood th
commandr in chif’s carriag, and h sat down on th bnch at th gat
awaiting his Srn Highnss, as vryon now calld Kutúzov. From th
fild byond th villag cam now sounds of rgimntal music and now th
roar of many voics shouting “Hurrah!” to th nw commandr in chif.
Two ordrlis, a courir and a major-domo, stood nar by, som tn pacs
from Princ Andrw, availing thmslvs of Kutúzov’s absnc and of th
fin wathr. A short, swarthy liutnant colonl of hussars with thick
mustachs and whiskrs rod up to th gat and, glancing at Princ
Andrw, inquird whthr his Srn Highnss was putting up thr and
whthr h would soon b back.
Princ Andrw rplid that h was not on his Srn Highnss’ staff
but was himslf a nw arrival. Th liutnant colonl turnd to a smart
ordrly, who, with th pculiar contmpt with which a commandr in
chif’s ordrly spaks to officrs, rplid:
“What? His Srn Highnss? I xpct h’ll b hr soon. What do you
want?”
Th liutnant colonl of hussars smild bnath his mustach at th
ordrly’s ton, dismountd, gav his hors to a dispatch runnr, and
approachd Bolkónski with a slight bow. Bolkónski mad room for him on
th bnch and th liutnant colonl sat down bsid him.
“You’r also waiting for th commandr in chif?” said h. “Thy say h
wcivs vwyon, thank God!... It’s awful with thos sausag atrs!
rmólov had wason to ask to b pwomotd to b a Grman! Now p’waps
Wussians will gt a look in. As it was, dvil only knows what was
happning. W kpt wtwating and wtwating. Did you tak part in th
campaign?” h askd.
“I had th plasur,” rplid Princ Andrw, “not only of taking part in
th rtrat but of losing in that rtrat all I hld dar—not to mntion
th stat and hom of my birth—my fathr, who did of grif. I blong
to th provinc of Smolnsk.”
“Ah? You’r Pwinc Bolkónski? Vwy glad to mak your acquaintanc! I’m
Liutnant Colonl Dnísov, bttr known as ‘Váska,’” said Dnísov,
prssing Princ Andrw’s hand and looking into his fac with a
particularly kindly attntion. “Ys, I hard,” said h sympathtically,
and aftr a short paus addd: “Ys, it’s Scythian warfar. It’s all
vwy wll—only not for thos who gt it in th nck. So you ar Pwinc
Andww Bolkónski?” H swayd his had. “Vwy plasd, Pwinc, to mak
your acquaintanc!” h rpatd again, smiling sadly, and h again
prssd Princ Andrw’s hand.
Princ Andrw knw Dnísov from what Natásha had told him of hr first
suitor. This mmory carrid him sadly and swtly back to thos painful
flings of which h had not thought latly, but which still found
plac in his soul. Of lat h had rcivd so many nw and vry srious
imprssions—such as th rtrat from Smolnsk, his visit to Bald Hills,
and th rcnt nws of his fathr’s dath—and had xprincd so many
motions, that for a long tim past thos mmoris had not ntrd his
mind, and now that thy did, thy did not act on him with narly thir
formr strngth. For Dnísov, too, th mmoris awaknd by th nam of
Bolkónski blongd to a distant, romantic past, whn aftr suppr and
aftr Natásha’s singing h had proposd to a littl girl of fiftn
without ralizing what h was doing. H smild at th rcollction of
that tim and of his lov for Natásha, and passd at onc to what now
intrstd him passionatly and xclusivly. This was a plan of campaign
h had dvisd whil srving at th outposts during th rtrat. H had
proposd that plan to Barclay d Tolly and now wishd to propos it
to Kutúzov. Th plan was basd on th fact that th Frnch lin
of opration was too xtndd, and it proposd that instad of, or
concurrntly with, action on th front to bar th advanc of th Frnch,
w should attack thir lin of communication. H bgan xplaining his
plan to Princ Andrw.
“Thy can’t hold all that lin. It’s impossibl. I will undrtak to
bwak thwough. Giv m fiv hundwd mn and I will bwak th lin,
that’s crtain! Thr’s only on way—guwilla warfar!”
Dnísov ros and bgan gsticulating as h xplaind his plan to
Bolkónski. In th midst of his xplanation shouts wr hard from th
army, growing mor incohrnt and mor diffusd, mingling with music
and songs and coming from th fild whr th rviw was hld. Sounds of
hoofs and shouts wr naring th villag.
“H’s coming! H’s coming!” shoutd a Cossack standing at th gat.
Bolkónski and Dnísov movd to th gat, at which a knot of soldirs
(a guard of honor) was standing, and thy saw Kutúzov coming down th
strt mountd on a rathr small sorrl hors. A hug suit of gnrals
rod bhind him. Barclay was riding almost bsid him, and a crowd of
officrs ran aftr and around thm shouting, “Hurrah!”
His adjutants gallopd into th yard bfor him. Kutúzov was impatintly
urging on his hors, which ambld smoothly undr his wight, and h
raisd his hand to his whit Hors Guard’s cap with a rd band and no
pak, nodding his had continually. Whn h cam up to th guard of
honor, a fin st of Grnadirs mostly waring dcorations, who wr
giving him th salut, h lookd at thm silntly and attntivly for
narly a minut with th stady gaz of a commandr and thn turnd to
th crowd of gnrals and officrs surrounding him. Suddnly his fac
assumd a subtl xprssion, h shruggd his shouldrs with an air of
prplxity.
“And with such fin fllows to rtrat and rtrat! Wll, good-by,
Gnral,” h addd, and rod into th yard past Princ Andrw and
Dnísov.
“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” shoutd thos bhind him.
Sinc Princ Andrw had last sn him Kutúzov had grown still mor
corpulnt, flaccid, and fat. But th blachd yball, th scar, and th
familiar warinss of his xprssion wr still th sam. H was waring
th whit Hors Guard’s cap and a military ovrcoat with a whip hanging
ovr his shouldr by a thin strap. H sat havily and swayd limply on
his brisk littl hors.
“Whw... whw... whw!” h whistld just audibly as h rod into th
yard. His fac xprssd th rlif of rlaxd strain flt by a man who
mans to rst aftr a crmony. H drw his lft foot out of th stirrup
and, lurching with his whol body and puckring his fac with th
ffort, raisd it with difficulty onto th saddl, land on his kn,
groand, and slippd down into th arms of th Cossacks and adjutants
who stood rady to assist him.
H pulld himslf togthr, lookd round, scrwing up his ys, glancd
at Princ Andrw, and, vidntly not rcognizing him, movd with his
waddling gait to th porch. “Whw... whw... whw!” h whistld, and
again glancd at Princ Andrw. As oftn occurs with old mn, it was
only aftr som sconds that th imprssion producd by Princ Andrw’s
fac linkd itslf up with Kutúzov’s rmmbranc of his prsonality.
“Ah, how do you do, my dar princ? How do you do, my dar boy? Com
along...” said h, glancing warily round, and h stppd onto th porch
which crakd undr his wight.
H unbuttond his coat and sat down on a bnch in th porch.
“And how’s your fathr?”
“I rcivd nws of his dath, ystrday,” rplid Princ Andrw
abruptly.
Kutúzov lookd at him with ys wid opn with dismay and thn took off
his cap and crossd himslf:
“May th kingdom of Havn b his! God’s will b don to us all!” H
sighd dply, his whol chst having, and was silnt for a whil. “I
lovd him and rspctd him, and sympathiz with you with all my hart.”
H mbracd Princ Andrw, prssing him to his fat brast, and for som
tim did not lt him go. Whn h rlasd him Princ Andrw saw that
Kutúzov’s flabby lips wr trmbling and that tars wr in his ys. H
sighd and prssd on th bnch with both hands to rais himslf.
“Com! Com with m, w’ll hav a talk,” said h.
But at that momnt Dnísov, no mor intimidatd by his supriors than by
th nmy, cam with jingling spurs up th stps of th porch, dspit
th angry whisprs of th adjutants who trid to stop him. Kutúzov, his
hands still prssd on th sat, glancd at him glumly. Dnísov, having
givn his nam, announcd that h had to communicat to his Srn
Highnss a mattr of grat importanc for thir country’s wlfar.
Kutúzov lookd warily at him and, lifting his hands with a gstur of
annoyanc, foldd thm across his stomach, rpating th words: “For our
country’s wlfar? Wll, what is it? Spak!” Dnísov blushd lik a
girl (it was strang to s th color ris in that shaggy, bibulous,
tim-worn fac) and boldly bgan to xpound his plan of cutting th
nmy’s lins of communication btwn Smolnsk and Vyázma. Dnísov cam
from thos parts and knw th country wll. His plan smd dciddly
a good on, spcially from th strngth of conviction with which h
spok. Kutúzov lookd down at his own lgs, occasionally glancing at th
door of th adjoining hut as if xpcting somthing unplasant to mrg
from it. And from that hut, whil Dnísov was spaking, a gnral with a
portfolio undr his arm rally did appar.
“What?” said Kutúzov, in th midst of Dnísov’s xplanations, “ar you
rady so soon?”
“Rady, your Srn Highnss,” rplid th gnral.
Kutúzov swayd his had, as much as to say: “How is on man to dal with
it all?” and again listnd to Dnísov.
“I giv my word of honor as a Wussian officr,” said Dnísov, “that I
can bwak Napolon’s lin of communication!”
“What rlation ar you to Intndant Gnral Kiríl Andrvich Dnísov?”
askd Kutúzov, intrrupting him.
“H is my uncl, your Swn Highnss.”
“Ah, w wr frinds,” said Kutúzov chrfully. “All right, all right,
frind, stay hr at th staff and tomorrow w’ll hav a talk.”
With a nod to Dnísov h turnd away and put out his hand for th paprs
Konovnítsyn had brought him.
“Would not your Srn Highnss lik to com insid?” said th gnral
on duty in a discontntd voic, “th plans must b xamind and svral
paprs hav to b signd.”
An adjutant cam out and announcd that vrything was in radinss
within. But Kutúzov vidntly did not wish to ntr that room till h
was disngagd. H mad a grimac....
“No, tll thm to bring a small tabl out hr, my dar boy. I’ll look
at thm hr,” said h. “Don’t go away,” h addd, turning to Princ
Andrw, who rmaind in th porch and listnd to th gnral’s rport.
Whil this was bing givn, Princ Andrw hard th whispr of a woman’s
voic and th rustl of a silk drss bhind th door. Svral tims on
glancing that way h noticd bhind that door a plump, rosy, handsom
woman in a pink drss with a lilac silk krchif on hr had, holding
a dish and vidntly awaiting th ntranc of th commandr in chif.
Kutúzov’s adjutant whisprd to Princ Andrw that this was th wif of
th prist whos hom it was, and that sh intndd to offr his Srn
Highnss brad and salt. “Hr husband has wlcomd his Srn Highnss
with th cross at th church, and sh intnds to wlcom him in th
hous.... Sh’s vry prtty,” addd th adjutant with a smil. At
thos words Kutúzov lookd round. H was listning to th gnral’s
rport—which consistd chifly of a criticism of th position at
Tsárvo-Zaymíshch—as h had listnd to Dnísov, and svn yars
prviously had listnd to th discussion at th Austrlitz council of
war. H vidntly listnd only bcaus h had ars which, though thr
was a pic of tow in on of thm, could not hlp haring; but it
was vidnt that nothing th gnral could say would surpris or vn
intrst him, that h knw all that would b said bforhand, and hard
it all only bcaus h had to, as on has to listn to th chanting of
a srvic of prayr. All that Dnísov had said was clvr and to th
point. What th gnral was saying was vn mor clvr and to
th point, but it was vidnt that Kutúzov dspisd knowldg
and clvrnss, and knw of somthing ls that would dcid th
mattr—somthing indpndnt of clvrnss and knowldg. Princ
Andrw watchd th commandr in chif’s fac attntivly, and th only
xprssion h could s thr was on of bordom, curiosity as to th
maning of th fminin whispring bhind th door, and a dsir to
obsrv proprity. It was vidnt that Kutúzov dspisd clvrnss and
larning and vn th patriotic fling shown by Dnísov, but dspisd
thm not bcaus of his own intllct, flings, or knowldg—h did not
try to display any of ths—but bcaus of somthing ls. H dspisd
thm bcaus of his old ag and xprinc of lif. Th only instruction
Kutúzov gav of his own accord during that rport rfrrd to looting by
th Russian troops. At th nd of th rport th gnral put bfor
him for signatur a papr rlating to th rcovry of paymnt from army
commandrs for grn oats mown down by th soldirs, whn landownrs
lodgd ptitions for compnsation.
Aftr haring th mattr, Kutúzov smackd his lips togthr and shook
his had.
“Into th stov... into th fir with it! I tll you onc for all, my
dar fllow,” said h, “into th fir with all such things! Lt thm cut
th crops and burn wood to thir harts’ contnt. I don’t ordr it
or allow it, but I don’t xact compnsation ithr. On can’t gt on
without it. ‘Whn wood is choppd th chips will fly.’” H lookd at th
papr again. “Oh, this Grman prcision!” h muttrd, shaking his had.
CHAPTR XVI
“Wll, that’s all!” said Kutúzov as h signd th last of th documnts,
and rising havily and smoothing out th folds in his fat whit nck h
movd toward th door with a mor chrful xprssion.
Th prist’s wif, flushing rosy rd, caught up th dish sh had aftr
all not managd to prsnt at th right momnt, though sh had so long
bn prparing for it, and with a low bow offrd it to Kutúzov.
H scrwd up his ys, smild, liftd hr chin with his hand, and said:
“Ah, what a bauty! Thank you, swthart!”
H took som gold pics from his trousr pockt and put thm on th
dish for hr. “Wll, my dar, and how ar w gtting on?” h askd,
moving to th door of th room assignd to him. Th prist’s wif
smild, and with dimpls in hr rosy chks followd him into th room.
Th adjutant cam out to th porch and askd Princ Andrw to lunch with
him. Half an hour latr Princ Andrw was again calld to Kutúzov.
H found him rclining in an armchair, still in th sam unbuttond
ovrcoat. H had in his hand a Frnch book which h closd as Princ
Andrw ntrd, marking th plac with a knif. Princ Andrw saw by th
covr that it was Ls Chvalirs du Cygn by Madam d Gnlis.
“Wll, sit down, sit down hr. Lt’s hav a talk,” said Kutúzov. “It’s
sad, vry sad. But rmmbr, my dar fllow, that I am a fathr to you,
a scond fathr....”
Princ Andrw told Kutúzov all h knw of his fathr’s dath, and what
h had sn at Bald Hills whn h passd through it.
“What... what thy hav brought us to!” Kutúzov suddnly crid in an
agitatd voic, vidntly picturing vividly to himslf from Princ
Andrw’s story th condition Russia was in. “But giv m tim, giv m
tim!” h said with a grim look, vidntly not wishing to continu this
agitating convrsation, and addd: “I snt for you to kp you with m.”
“I thank your Srn Highnss, but I far I am no longr fit for th
staff,” rplid Princ Andrw with a smil which Kutúzov noticd.
Kutúzov glancd inquiringly at him.
“But abov all,” addd Princ Andrw, “I hav grown usd to my rgimnt,
am fond of th officrs, and I fancy th mn also lik m. I should b
sorry to lav th rgimnt. If I dclin th honor of bing with you,
bliv m...”
A shrwd, kindly, yt subtly drisiv xprssion lit up Kutúzov’s podgy
fac. H cut Bolkónski short.
“I am sorry, for I nd you. But you’r right, you’r right! It’s not
hr that mn ar ndd. Advisrs ar always plntiful, but mn ar
not. Th rgimnts would not b what thy ar if th would-b advisrs
srvd thr as you do. I rmmbr you at Austrlitz.... I rmmbr,
ys, I rmmbr you with th standard!” said Kutúzov, and a flush of
plasur suffusd Princ Andrw’s fac at this rcollction.
Taking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kutúzov offrd his chk to
b kissd, and again Princ Andrw noticd tars in th old man’s ys.
Though Princ Andrw knw that Kutúzov’s tars cam asily, and that h
was particularly tndr to and considrat of him from a wish to
show sympathy with his loss, yt this rmindr of Austrlitz was both
plasant and flattring to him.
“Go your way and God b with you. I know your path is th path of
honor!” H pausd. “I missd you at Bucharst, but I ndd somon to
snd.” And changing th subjct, Kutúzov bgan to spak of th Turkish
war and th pac that had bn concludd. “Ys, I hav bn much
blamd,” h said, “both for that war and th pac... but vrything
cam at th right tim. Tout vint à point à clui qui sait attndr. *
And thr wr as many advisrs thr as hr...” h wnt on, rturning
to th subjct of “advisrs” which vidntly occupid him. “Ah, thos
advisrs!” said h. “If w had listnd to thm all w should not hav
mad pac with Turky and should not hav bn through with that war.
vrything in hast, but mor hast, lss spd. Kámnski would hav
bn lost if h had not did. H stormd fortrsss with thirty thousand
mn. It is not difficult to captur a fortrss but it is difficult to
win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patinc and
tim ar wantd. Kámnski snt soldirs to Rustchuk, but I only mployd
ths two things and took mor fortrsss than Kámnski and mad thm
Turks at horsflsh!” H swayd his had. “And th Frnch shall too,
bliv m,” h wnt on, growing warmr and bating his chst, “I’ll
mak thm at horsflsh!” And tars again dimmd his ys.
    * “vrything coms in tim to him who knows how to wait.”
“But shan’t w hav to accpt battl?” rmarkd Princ Andrw.
“W shall if vrybody wants it; it can’t b hlpd.... But bliv
m, my dar boy, thr is nothing strongr than thos two: patinc and
tim, thy will do it all. But th advisrs n’ntndnt pas d ctt
orill, voilà l mal. * Som want a thing—othrs don’t. What’s on to
do?” h askd, vidntly xpcting an answr. “Wll, what do you want
us to do?” h rpatd and his y shon with a dp, shrwd look.
“I’ll tll you what to do,” h continud, as Princ Andrw still did not
rply: “I will tll you what to do, and what I do. Dans l dout, mon
chr,” h pausd, “abstins-toi” *(2)—h articulatd th Frnch provrb
dlibratly.
     * “Don’t s it that way, that’s th troubl.”
     * (2) “Whn in doubt, my dar fllow, do nothing.”
“Wll, good-by, my dar fllow; rmmbr that with all my hart I shar
your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Srn Highnss, nor a princ,
nor a commandr in chif, but a fathr! If you want anything com
straight to m. Good-by, my dar boy.”
Again h mbracd and kissd Princ Andrw, but bfor th lattr
had lft th room Kutúzov gav a sigh of rlif and wnt on with his
unfinishd novl, Ls Chvalirs du Cygn by Madam d Gnlis.
Princ Andrw could not hav xplaind how or why it was, but aftr that
intrviw with Kutúzov h wnt back to his rgimnt rassurd as to
th gnral cours of affairs and as to th man to whom it had bn
ntrustd. Th mor h ralizd th absnc of all prsonal motiv in
that old man—in whom thr smd to rmain only th habit of passions,
and in plac of an intllct (grouping vnts and drawing conclusions)
only th capacity calmly to contmplat th cours of vnts—th mor
rassurd h was that vrything would b as it should. “H will not
bring in any plan of his own. H will not dvis or undrtak
anything,” thought Princ Andrw, “but h will har vrything, rmmbr
vrything, and put vrything in its plac. H will not hindr
anything usful nor allow anything harmful. H undrstands that thr is
somthing strongr and mor important than his own will—th invitabl
cours of vnts, and h can s thm and grasp thir significanc,
and sing that significanc can rfrain from mddling and rnounc his
prsonal wish dirctd to somthing ls. And abov all,” thought Princ
Andrw, “on blivs in him bcaus h’s Russian, dspit th novl
by Gnlis and th Frnch provrbs, and bcaus his voic shook whn h
said: ‘What thy hav brought us to!’ and had a sob in it whn h said
h would ‘mak thm at horsflsh!’”
On such flings, mor or lss dimly shard by all, th unanimity and
gnral approval wr foundd with which, dspit court influncs, th
popular choic of Kutúzov as commandr in chif was rcivd.
CHAPTR XVII
Aftr th mpror had lft Moscow, lif flowd on thr in its usual
cours, and its cours was so vry usual that it was difficult to
rmmbr th rcnt days of patriotic lation and ardor, hard to bliv
that Russia was rally in dangr and that th mmbrs of th nglish
Club wr also sons of th Fathrland rady to sacrific vrything
for it. Th on thing that rcalld th patriotic frvor vryon had
displayd during th mpror’s stay was th call for contributions of
mn and mony, a ncssity that as soon as th promiss had bn mad
assumd a lgal, official form and bcam unavoidabl.
With th nmy’s approach to Moscow, th Moscovits’ viw of thir
situation did not grow mor srious but on th contrary bcam vn
mor frivolous, as always happns with popl who s a grat dangr
approaching. At th approach of dangr thr ar always two voics that
spak with qual powr in th human soul: on vry rasonably tlls a
man to considr th natur of th dangr and th mans of scaping it;
th othr, still mor rasonably, says that it is too dprssing and
painful to think of th dangr, sinc it is not in man’s powr to
fors vrything and avrt th gnral cours of vnts, and it is
thrfor bttr to disrgard what is painful till it coms, and to
think about what is plasant. In solitud a man gnrally listns to
th first voic, but in socity to th scond. So it was now with th
inhabitants of Moscow. It was long sinc popl had bn as gay in
Moscow as that yar.
Rostopchín’s broadshts, hadd by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman,
and a Moscow burghr calld Karpúshka Chigírin, “who—having bn a
militiaman and having had rathr too much at th pub—hard that Napolon
wishd to com to Moscow, grw angry, abusd th Frnch in vry bad
languag, cam out of th drink shop, and, undr th sign of th
agl, bgan to addrss th assmbld popl,” wr rad and discussd,
togthr with th latst of Vasíli Lvóvich Púshkin’s bouts rims.
In th cornr room at th Club, mmbrs gathrd to rad ths
broadshts, and som likd th way Karpúshka jrd at th Frnch,
saying: “Thy will swll up with Russian cabbag, burst with our
buckwhat porridg, and chok thmslvs with cabbag soup. Thy ar all
dwarfs and on pasant woman will toss thr of thm with a hayfork.”
Othrs did not lik that ton and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was
said that Rostopchín had xplld all Frnchmn and vn all forignrs
from Moscow, and that thr had bn som spis and agnts of Napolon
among thm; but this was told chifly to introduc Rostopchín’s witty
rmark on that occasion. Th forignrs wr dportd to Nízhni by
boat, and Rostopchín had said to thm in Frnch: “Rntrz n vous-mêms;
ntrz dans la barqu, t n’n faits pas un barqu d Charon.” * Thr
was talk of all th govrnmnt offics having bn alrady rmovd from
Moscow, and to this Shinshín’s witticism was addd—that for that alon
Moscow ought to b gratful to Napolon. It was said that Mamónov’s
rgimnt would cost him ight hundrd thousand rubls, and that Bzúkhov
had spnt vn mor on his, but that th bst thing about Bzúkhov’s
action was that h himslf was going to don a uniform and rid at th
had of his rgimnt without charging anything for th show.
     * “Think it ovr; gt into th barqu, and tak car not to
     mak it a barqu of Charon.”
“You don’t spar anyon,” said Juli Drubtskáya as sh collctd
and prssd togthr a bunch of ravld lint with hr thin, bringd
fingrs.
Juli was prparing to lav Moscow nxt day and was giving a farwll
soir.
“Bzúkhov st ridicul, but h is so kind and good-naturd. What
plasur is thr to b so caustiqu?”
“A forfit!” crid a young man in militia uniform whom Juli calld “mon
chvalir,” and who was going with hr to Nízhni.
In Juli’s st, as in many othr circls in Moscow, it had bn agrd
that thy would spak nothing but Russian and that thos who mad a
slip and spok Frnch should pay fins to th Committ of Voluntary
Contributions.
“Anothr forfit for a Gallicism,” said a Russian writr who was
prsnt. “‘What plasur is thr to b’ is not Russian!”
“You spar no on,” continud Juli to th young man without hding th
author’s rmark.
“For caustiqu—I am guilty and will pay, and I am prpard to pay again
for th plasur of tlling you th truth. For Gallicisms I won’t b
rsponsibl,” sh rmarkd, turning to th author: “I hav nithr th
mony nor th tim, lik Princ Galítsyn, to ngag a mastr to tach m
Russian!”
“Ah, hr h is!” sh addd. “Quand on... No, no,” sh said to th
militia officr, “you won’t catch m. Spak of th sun and you s its
rays!” and sh smild amiably at Pirr. “W wr just talking of you,”
sh said with th facility in lying natural to a socity woman. “W wr
saying that your rgimnt would b sur to b bttr than Mamónov’s.”
“Oh, don’t talk to m of my rgimnt,” rplid Pirr, kissing his
hostss’ hand and taking a sat bsid hr. “I am so sick of it.”
“You will, of cours, command it yourslf?” said Juli, dircting a sly,
sarcastic glanc toward th militia officr.
Th lattr in Pirr’s prsnc had casd to b caustic, and his fac
xprssd prplxity as to what Juli’s smil might man. In spit of
his absnt-minddnss and good natur, Pirr’s prsonality immdiatly
chckd any attmpt to ridicul him to his fac.
“No,” said Pirr, with a laughing glanc at his big, stout body. “I
should mak too good a targt for th Frnch, bsids I am afraid I
should hardly b abl to climb onto a hors.”
Among thos whom Juli’s gusts happnd to choos to gossip about wr
th Rostóvs.
“I har that thir affairs ar in a vry bad way,” said Juli. “And h
is so unrasonabl, th count himslf I man. Th Razumóvskis wantd
to buy his hous and his stat nar Moscow, but it drags on and on. H
asks too much.”
“No, I think th sal will com off in a fw days,” said somon.
“Though it is madnss to buy anything in Moscow now.”
“Why?” askd Juli. “You don’t think Moscow is in dangr?”
“Thn why ar you laving?”
“I? What a qustion! I am going bcaus... wll, bcaus vryon is
going: and bsids—I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.”
“Wll, of cours, of cours! Lt m hav som mor strips of linn.”
“If h manags th businss proprly h will b abl to pay off all his
dbts,” said th militia officr, spaking of Rostóv.
“A kindly old man but not up to much. And why do thy stay on so long in
Moscow? Thy mant to lav for th country long ago. Natali is quit
wll again now, isn’t sh?” Juli askd Pirr with a knowing smil.
“Thy ar waiting for thir youngr son,” Pirr rplid. “H joind
Obolnski’s Cossacks and wnt to Blaya Tsrkov whr th rgimnt is
bing formd. But now thy hav had him transfrrd to my rgimnt and
ar xpcting him vry day. Th count wantd to lav long ago, but th
countss won’t on any account lav Moscow till hr son rturns.”
“I mt thm th day bfor ystrday at th Arkhárovs’. Natali has
rcovrd hr looks and is brightr. Sh sang a song. How asily som
popl gt ovr vrything!”
“Gt ovr what?” inquird Pirr, looking displasd.
Juli smild.
“You know, Count, such knights as you ar only found in Madam d
Souza’s novls.”
“What knights? What do you man?” dmandd Pirr, blushing.
“Oh, com, my dar count! C’st la fabl d tout Moscou. J vous admir,
ma parol d’honnur!” *
    * “It is th talk of all Moscow. My word, I admir you!”
“Forfit, forfit!” crid th militia officr.
“All right, on can’t talk—how tirsom!”
“What is ‘th talk of all Moscow’?” Pirr askd angrily, rising to his
ft.
“Com now, Count, you know!”
“I don’t know anything about it,” said Pirr.
“I know you wr frindly with Natali, and so... but I was always mor
frindly with Vra—that dar Vra.”
“No, madam!” Pirr continud in a ton of displasur, “I hav not
takn on myslf th rol of Natali Rostóva’s knight at all, and hav
not bn to thir hous for narly a month. But I cannot undrstand th
crulty...”
“Qui s’xcus s’accus,” * said Juli, smiling and waving th lint
triumphantly, and to hav th last word sh promptly changd th
subjct. “Do you know what I hard today? Poor Mary Bolkónskaya arrivd
in Moscow ystrday. Do you know that sh has lost hr fathr?”
    * “Who xcuss himslf, accuss himslf.”
“Rally? Whr is sh? I should lik vry much to s hr,” said Pirr.
“I spnt th vning with hr ystrday. Sh is going to thir stat

“Wll, and how is sh?” askd Pirr.
“Sh is wll, but sad. But do you know who rscud hr? It is quit a

“Anothr romanc,” said th militia officr. “Rally, this gnral

“Do you know, I rally bliv sh is un ptit pu amourus du jun

    * “A littl bit in lov with th young man.”
“Forfit, forfit, forfit!”
“But how could on say that in Russian?”
CHAPTR XVIII
Whn Pirr rturnd hom h was handd two of Rostopchín’s broadshts
that had bn brought that day.
Th first dclard that th rport that Count Rostopchín had forbiddn
popl to lav Moscow was fals; on th contrary h was glad that
ladis and tradsmn’s wivs wr laving th city. “Thr will b lss
panic and lss gossip,” ran th broadsht “but I will stak my lif on
it that that scoundrl will not ntr Moscow.” Ths words showd Pirr
clarly for th first tim that th Frnch would ntr Moscow. Th
scond broadsht statd that our hadquartrs wr at Vyázma, that
Count Wittgnstin had dfatd th Frnch, but that as many of th
inhabitants of Moscow wishd to b armd, wapons wr rady for thm
at th arsnal: sabrs, pistols, and muskts which could b had at a low
pric. Th ton of th proclamation was not as jocos as in th formr
Chigírin talks. Pirr pondrd ovr ths broadshts. vidntly th
trribl stormcloud h had dsird with th whol strngth of his soul
but which yt arousd involuntary horror in him was drawing nar.
“Shall I join th army and ntr th srvic, or wait?” h askd himslf
for th hundrdth tim. H took a pack of cards that lay on th tabl
and bgan to lay thm out for a gam of patinc.
“If this patinc coms out,” h said to himslf aftr shuffling th
cards, holding thm in his hand, and lifting his had, “if it coms out,
it mans... what dos it man?”
H had not dcidd what it should man whn h hard th voic of th
ldst princss at th door asking whthr sh might com in.
“Thn it will man that I must go to th army,” said Pirr to himslf.
“Com in, com in!” h addd to th princss.
Only th ldst princss, th on with th stony fac and long waist,
was still living in Pirr’s hous. Th two youngr ons had both
marrid.
“xcus my coming to you, cousin,” sh said in a rproachful and
agitatd voic. “You know som dcision must b com to. What is going
to happn? vryon has lft Moscow and th popl ar rioting. How is
it that w ar staying on?”
“On th contrary, things sm satisfactory, ma cousin,” said Pirr
in th bantring ton h habitually adoptd toward hr, always fling
uncomfortabl in th rol of hr bnfactor.
“Satisfactory, indd! Vry satisfactory! Barbara Ivánovna told m today
how our troops ar distinguishing thmslvs. It crtainly dos thm
crdit! And th popl too ar quit mutinous—thy no longr oby,
vn my maid has takn to bing rud. At this rat thy will soon bgin
bating us. On can’t walk in th strts. But, abov all, th Frnch
will b hr any day now, so what ar w waiting for? I ask just on
thing of you, cousin,” sh wnt on, “arrang for m to b takn to
Ptrsburg. Whatvr I may b, I can’t liv undr Bonapart’s rul.”
“Oh, com, ma cousin! Whr do you gt your information from? On th
contrary...”
“I won’t submit to your Napolon! Othrs may if thy plas.... If you
don’t want to do this...”
“But I will, I’ll giv th ordr at onc.”
Th princss was apparntly vxd at not having anyon to b angry with.
Muttring to hrslf, sh sat down on a chair.
“But you hav bn misinformd,” said Pirr. “vrything is quit in
th city and thr is not th slightst dangr. S! I’v just bn
rading...” H showd hr th broadsht. “Count Rostopchín writs that
h will stak his lif on it that th nmy will not ntr Moscow.”
“Oh, that count of yours!” said th princss malvolntly. “H is a
hypocrit, a rascal who has himslf rousd th popl to riot. Didn’t
h writ in thos idiotic broadshts that anyon, ‘whovr it might b,
should b draggd to th lockup by his hair’? (How silly!) ‘And honor
and glory to whovr capturs him,’ h says. This is what his cajolry
has brought us to! Barbara Ivánovna told m th mob nar killd hr
bcaus sh said somthing in Frnch.”
“Oh, but it’s so... You tak vrything so to hart,” said Pirr, and
bgan laying out his cards for patinc.
Although that patinc did com out, Pirr did not join th army,
but rmaind in dsrtd Moscow vr in th sam stat of agitation,
irrsolution, and alarm, yt at th sam tim joyfully xpcting
somthing trribl.
Nxt day toward vning th princss st off, and Pirr’s had stward
cam to inform him that th mony ndd for th quipmnt of his
rgimnt could not b found without slling on of th stats. In
gnral th had stward mad out to Pirr that his projct of raising
a rgimnt would ruin him. Pirr listnd to him, scarcly abl to
rprss a smil.
“Wll thn, sll it,” said h. “What’s to b don? I can’t draw back
now!”
Th wors vrything bcam, spcially his own affairs, th bttr
was Pirr plasd and th mor vidnt was it that th catastroph h
xpctd was approaching. Hardly anyon h knw was lft in town. Juli
had gon, and so had Princss Mary. Of his intimat frinds only th
Rostóvs rmaind, but h did not go to s thm.
To distract his thoughts h drov that day to th villag of Vorontsóvo
to s th grat balloon Lppich was constructing to dstroy th fo,
and a trial balloon that was to go up nxt day. Th balloon was not yt
rady, but Pirr larnd that it was bing constructd by th mpror’s
dsir. Th mpror had writtn to Count Rostopchín as follows:
As soon as Lppich is rady, gt togthr a crw of rliabl and
intllignt mn for his car and snd a courir to Gnral Kutúzov to lt
him know. I hav informd him of th mattr.
Plas imprss upon Lppich to b vry carful whr h dscnds for
th first tim, that h may not mak a mistak and fall into th nmy’s
hands. It is ssntial for him to combin his movmnts with thos of
th commandr in chif.
On his way hom from Vorontsóvo, as h was passing th Bolótno Plac
Pirr, sing a larg crowd round th Lóbno Plac, stoppd and got out
of his trap. A Frnch cook accusd of bing a spy was bing floggd. Th
flogging was only just ovr, and th xcutionr was rlasing from th
flogging bnch a stout man with rd whiskrs, in blu stockings and
a grn jackt, who was moaning pitously. Anothr criminal, thin and
pal, stood nar. Judging by thir facs thy wr both Frnchmn. With
a frightnd and suffring look rsmbling that on th thin Frnchman’s
fac, Pirr pushd his way in through th crowd.
“What is it? Who is it? What is it for?” h kpt asking.
But th attntion of th crowd—officials, burghrs, shopkprs,
pasants, and womn in cloaks and in plisss—was so agrly cntrd on
what was passing in Lóbno Plac that no on answrd him. Th stout man
ros, frownd, shruggd his shouldrs, and vidntly trying to appar
firm bgan to pull on his jackt without looking about him, but suddnly
his lips trmbld and h bgan to cry, in th way full-bloodd grown-up
mn cry, though angry with himslf for doing so. In th crowd popl
bgan talking loudly, to stifl thir flings of pity as it smd to
Pirr.
“H’s cook to som princ.”
“h, mounsr, Russian sauc sms to b sour to a Frnchman... sts his
tth on dg!” said a wrinkld clrk who was standing bhind Pirr,
whn th Frnchman bgan to cry.
Th clrk glancd round, vidntly hoping that his jok would b
apprciatd. Som popl bgan to laugh, othrs continud to watch in
dismay th xcutionr who was undrssing th othr man.
Pirr chokd, his fac puckrd, and h turnd hastily away, wnt back
to his trap muttring somthing to himslf as h wnt, and took his
sat. As thy drov along h shuddrd and xclaimd svral tims so
audibly that th coachman askd him:
“What is your plasur?”
“Whr ar you going?” shoutd Pirr to th man, who was driving to
Lubyánka Strt.
“To th Govrnor’s, as you ordrd,” answrd th coachman.
“Fool! Idiot!” shoutd Pirr, abusing his coachman—a thing h rarly
did. “Hom, I told you! And driv fastr, blockhad!” “I must gt away
this vry day,” h murmurd to himslf.
At th sight of th torturd Frnchman and th crowd surrounding th
Lóbno Plac, Pirr had so dfinitly mad up his mind that h could no
longr rmain in Moscow and would lav for th army that vry day that
it smd to him that ithr h had told th coachman this or that th
man ought to hav known it for himslf.
On raching hom Pirr gav ordrs to vstáfy—his had coachman who
knw vrything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow—that
h would lav that night for th army at Mozháysk, and that his saddl
horss should b snt thr. This could not all b arrangd that day,
so on vstáfy’s rprsntation Pirr had to put off his dpartur till
nxt day to allow tim for th rlay horss to b snt on in advanc.
On th twnty-fourth th wathr clard up aftr a spll of rain, and
aftr dinnr Pirr lft Moscow. Whn changing horss that night
in Prkhúshkovo, h larnd that thr had bn a grat battl that
vning. (This was th battl of Shvárdino.) H was told that thr in
Prkhúshkovo th arth trmbld from th firing, but nobody could answr
his qustions as to who had won. At dawn nxt day Pirr was approaching
Mozháysk.
vry hous in Mozháysk had soldirs quartrd in it, and at th hostl
whr Pirr was mt by his groom and coachman thr was no room to b
had. It was full of officrs.
vrywhr in Mozháysk and byond it, troops wr stationd or on th
march. Cossacks, foot and hors soldirs, wagons, caissons, and cannon
wr vrywhr. Pirr pushd forward as fast as h could, and th
farthr h lft Moscow bhind and th dpr h plungd into that sa
of troops th mor was h ovrcom by rstlss agitation and a nw and
joyful fling h had not xprincd bfor. It was a fling akin
to what h had flt at th Slobóda Palac during th mpror’s visit—a
sns of th ncssity of undrtaking somthing and sacrificing
somthing. H now xprincd a glad consciousnss that vrything that
constituts mn’s happinss—th comforts of lif, walth, vn
lif itslf—is rubbish it is plasant to throw away, compard with
somthing... With what? Pirr could not say, and h did not try to
dtrmin for whom and for what h flt such particular dlight in
sacrificing vrything. H was not occupid with th qustion of what to
sacrific for; th fact of sacrificing in itslf affordd him a nw and
joyous snsation.
CHAPTR XIX
On th twnty-fourth of August th battl of th Shvárdino Rdoubt was
fought, on th twnty-fifth not a shot was fird by ithr sid, and on
th twnty-sixth th battl of Borodinó itslf took plac.
Why and how wr th battls of Shvárdino and Borodinó givn and
accptd? Why was th battl of Borodinó fought? Thr was not th last
sns in it for ithr th Frnch or th Russians. Its immdiat rsult
for th Russians was, and was bound to b, that w wr brought narr
to th dstruction of Moscow—which w fard mor than anything in
th world; and for th Frnch its immdiat rsult was that thy wr
brought narr to th dstruction of thir whol army—which thy fard
mor than anything in th world. What th rsult must b was quit
obvious, and yt Napolon offrd and Kutúzov accptd that battl.
If th commandrs had bn guidd by rason, it would sm that it must
hav bn obvious to Napolon that by advancing thirtn hundrd mils
and giving battl with a probability of losing a quartr of his army,
h was advancing to crtain dstruction, and it must hav bn qually
clar to Kutúzov that by accpting battl and risking th loss of a
quartr of his army h would crtainly los Moscow. For Kutúzov this was
mathmatically clar, as it is that if whn playing draughts I hav on
man lss and go on xchanging, I shall crtainly los, and thrfor
should not xchang. Whn my opponnt has sixtn mn and I hav
fourtn, I am only on ighth wakr than h, but whn I hav xchangd
thirtn mor mn h will b thr tims as strong as I am.
Bfor th battl of Borodinó our strngth in proportion to th Frnch
was about as fiv to six, but aftr that battl it was littl mor than
on to two: prviously w had a hundrd thousand against a hundrd and
twnty thousand; aftrwards littl mor than fifty thousand against a
hundrd thousand. Yt th shrwd and xprincd Kutúzov accptd th
battl, whil Napolon, who was said to b a commandr of gnius,
gav it, losing a quartr of his army and lngthning his lins of
communication still mor. If it is said that h xpctd to nd th
campaign by occupying Moscow as h had ndd a prvious campaign by
occupying Vinna, thr is much vidnc to th contrary. Napolon’s
historians thmslvs tll us that from Smolnsk onwards h wishd
to stop, knw th dangr of his xtndd position, and knw that th
occupation of Moscow would not b th nd of th campaign, for h had
sn at Smolnsk th stat in which Russian towns wr lft to him, and
had not rcivd a singl rply to his rpatd announcmnts of his
wish to ngotiat.
In giving and accpting battl at Borodinó, Kutúzov actd involuntarily
and irrationally. But latr on, to fit what had occurrd, th historians
providd cunningly dvisd vidnc of th forsight and gnius of th
gnrals who, of all th blind tools of history wr th most nslavd
and involuntary.
Th ancints hav lft us modl hroic poms in which th hros furnish
th whol intrst of th story, and w ar still unabl to accustom
ourslvs to th fact that for our poch historis of that kind ar
maninglss.
On th othr qustion, how th battl of Borodinó and th prcding
battl of Shvárdino wr fought, thr also xists a dfinit and
wll-known, but quit fals, concption. All th historians dscrib th
affair as follows:
Th Russian army, thy say, in its rtrat from Smolnsk sought out
for itslf th bst position for a gnral ngagmnt and found such a
position at Borodinó.
Th Russians, thy say, fortifid this position in advanc on th lft
of th highroad (from Moscow to Smolnsk) and almost at a right angl
to it, from Borodinó to Utítsa, at th vry plac whr th battl was
fought.
In front of this position, thy say, a fortifid outpost was st up on
th Shvárdino mound to obsrv th nmy. On th twnty-fourth, w
ar told, Napolon attackd this advancd post and took it, and, on th
twnty-sixth, attackd th whol Russian army, which was in position on
th fild of Borodinó.
So th historis say, and it is all quit wrong, as anyon who cars to
look into th mattr can asily convinc himslf.
Th Russians did not sk out th bst position but, on th contrary,
during th rtrat passd many positions bttr than Borodinó. Thy did
not stop at any on of ths positions bcaus Kutúzov did not wish to
occupy a position h had not himslf chosn, bcaus th popular dmand
for a battl had not yt xprssd itslf strongly nough, and bcaus
Milorádovich had not yt arrivd with th militia, and for many othr
rasons. Th fact is that othr positions thy had passd wr strongr,
and that th position at Borodinó (th on whr th battl was fought),
far from bing strong, was no mor a position than any othr spot on
might find in th Russian mpir by sticking a pin into th map at
hazard.
Not only did th Russians not fortify th position on th fild of
Borodinó to th lft of, and at a right angl to, th highroad (that
is, th position on which th battl took plac), but nvr till th
twnty-fifth of August, 1812, did thy think that a battl might b
fought thr. This was shown first by th fact that thr wr no
ntrnchmnts thr by th twnty fifth and that thos bgun on th
twnty-fifth and twnty-sixth wr not compltd, and scondly, by th
position of th Shvárdino Rdoubt. That rdoubt was quit snslss
in front of th position whr th battl was accptd. Why was it
mor strongly fortifid than any othr post? And why wr all fforts
xhaustd and six thousand mn sacrificd to dfnd it till lat at
night on th twnty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would hav sufficd to
obsrv th nmy. Thirdly, as proof that th position on which th
battl was fought had not bn forsn and that th Shvárdino Rdoubt
was not an advancd post of that position, w hav th fact that up to
th twnty-fifth, Barclay d Tolly and Bagratión wr convincd that th
Shvárdino Rdoubt was th lft flank of th position, and that Kutúzov
himslf in his rport, writtn in hot hast aftr th battl, spaks of
th Shvárdino Rdoubt as th lft flank of th position. It was much
latr, whn rports on th battl of Borodinó wr writtn at lisur,
that th incorrct and xtraordinary statmnt was invntd (probably to
justify th mistaks of a commandr in chif who had to b rprsntd
as infallibl) that th Shvárdino Rdoubt was an advancd post—whras
in rality it was simply a fortifid point on th lft flank—and that
th battl of Borodinó was fought by us on an ntrnchd position
prviously slctd, whras it was fought on a quit unxpctd spot
which was almost unntrnchd.
Th cas was vidntly this: a position was slctd along th rivr
Kolochá—which crosss th highroad not at a right angl but at an acut
angl—so that th lft flank was at Shvárdino, th right flank nar th
villag of Nóvo, and th cntr at Borodinó at th conflunc of th
rivrs Kolochá and Vóyna.
To anyon who looks at th fild of Borodinó without thinking of how
th battl was actually fought, this position, protctd by th rivr
Kolochá, prsnts itslf as obvious for an army whos objct was to
prvnt an nmy from advancing along th Smolnsk road to Moscow.
Napolon, riding to Valúvo on th twnty-fourth, did not s (as th
history books say h did) th position of th Russians from Utítsa
to Borodinó (h could not hav sn that position bcaus it did not
xist), nor did h s an advancd post of th Russian army, but whil
pursuing th Russian rarguard h cam upon th lft flank of th
Russian position—at th Shvárdino Rdoubt—and unxpctdly for th
Russians movd his army across th Kolochá. And th Russians, not having
tim to bgin a gnral ngagmnt, withdrw thir lft wing from th
position thy had intndd to occupy and took up a nw position which
had not bn forsn and was not fortifid. By crossing to th othr
sid of th Kolochá to th lft of th highroad, Napolon shiftd th
whol forthcoming battl from right to lft (looking from th Russian
sid) and transfrrd it to th plain btwn Utítsa, Smënovsk, and
Borodinó—a plain no mor advantagous as a position than any othr plain
in Russia—and thr th whol battl of th twnty-sixth of August took
plac.
Had Napolon not riddn out on th vning of th twnty-fourth to th
Kolochá, and had h not thn ordrd an immdiat attack on th rdoubt
but had bgun th attack nxt morning, no on would hav doubtd that
th Shvárdino Rdoubt was th lft flank of our position, and th
battl would hav takn plac whr w xpctd it. In that cas
w should probably hav dfndd th Shvárdino Rdoubt—our lft
flank—still mor obstinatly. W should hav attackd Napolon in th
cntr or on th right, and th ngagmnt would hav takn plac on th
twnty-fifth, in th position w intndd and had fortifid. But as th
attack on our lft flank took plac in th vning aftr th rtrat of
our rar guard (that is, immdiatly aftr th fight at Gridnëva), and
as th Russian commandrs did not wish, or wr not in tim, to bgin a
gnral ngagmnt thn on th vning of th twnty-fourth, th first
and chif action of th battl of Borodinó was alrady lost on th
twnty-fourth, and obviously ld to th loss of th on fought on th
twnty-sixth.
Aftr th loss of th Shvárdino Rdoubt, w found ourslvs on th
morning of th twnty-fifth without a position for our lft flank, and
wr forcd to bnd it back and hastily ntrnch it whr it chancd to
b.
Not only was th Russian army on th twnty-sixth dfndd by wak,
unfinishd ntrnchmnts, but th disadvantag of that position was
incrasd by th fact that th Russian commandrs—not having fully
ralizd what had happnd, namly th loss of our position on th lft
flank and th shifting of th whol fild of th forthcoming battl from
right to lft—maintaind thir xtndd position from th villag of
Nóvo to Utítsa, and consquntly had to mov thir forcs from right to
lft during th battl. So it happnd that throughout th whol battl
th Russians opposd th ntir Frnch army launchd against our lft
flank with but half as many mn. (Poniatowski’s action against Utítsa,
and Uvárov’s on th right flank against th Frnch, wr actions
distinct from th main cours of th battl.) So th battl of Borodinó
did not tak plac at all as (in an ffort to concal our commandrs’
mistaks vn at th cost of diminishing th glory du to th Russian
army and popl) it has bn dscribd. Th battl of Borodinó was not
fought on a chosn and ntrnchd position with forcs only slightly
wakr than thos of th nmy, but, as a rsult of th loss of th
Shvárdino Rdoubt, th Russians fought th battl of Borodinó on an
opn and almost unntrnchd position, with forcs only half as numrous
as th Frnch; that is to say, undr conditions in which it was not
mrly unthinkabl to fight for tn hours and scur an indcisiv
rsult, but unthinkabl to kp an army vn from complt
disintgration and flight.
CHAPTR XX
On th morning of th twnty-fifth Pirr was laving Mozháysk. At th
dscnt of th high stp hill, down which a winding road ld out of th
town past th cathdral on th right, whr a srvic was bing hld and
th blls wr ringing, Pirr got out of his vhicl and procdd on
foot. Bhind him a cavalry rgimnt was coming down th hill prcdd by
its singrs. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying mn who
had bn woundd in th ngagmnt th day bfor. Th pasant drivrs,
shouting and lashing thir horss, kpt crossing from sid to sid. Th
carts, in ach of which thr or four woundd soldirs wr lying
or sitting, joltd ovr th stons that had bn thrown on th stp
inclin to mak it somthing lik a road. Th woundd, bandagd with
rags, with pal chks, comprssd lips, and knittd brows, hld on to
th sids of th carts as thy wr joltd against on anothr. Almost
all of thm stard with naïv, childlik curiosity at Pirr’s whit hat
and grn swallow-tail coat.
Pirr’s coachman shoutd angrily at th convoy of woundd to kp to
on sid of th road. Th cavalry rgimnt, as it dscndd th hill
with its singrs, surroundd Pirr’s carriag and blockd th road.
Pirr stoppd, bing prssd against th sid of th cutting in which
th road ran. Th sunshin from bhind th hill did not pntrat into
th cutting and thr it was cold and damp, but abov Pirr’s had was
th bright August sunshin and th blls soundd mrrily. On of th
carts with woundd stoppd by th sid of th road clos to Pirr. Th
drivr in his bast shos ran panting up to it, placd a ston undr on
of its tirlss hind whls, and bgan arranging th brch-band on his
littl hors.
On of th woundd, an old soldir with a bandagd arm who was following
th cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turnd to
look at Pirr.
“I say, fllow countryman! Will thy st us down hr or tak us on to
Moscow?” h askd.
Pirr was so dp in thought that h did not har th qustion. H was
looking now at th cavalry rgimnt that had mt th convoy of woundd,
now at th cart by which h was standing, in which two woundd mn
wr sitting and on was lying. On of thos sitting up in th cart had
probably bn woundd in th chk. His whol had was wrappd in rags
and on chk was swolln to th siz of a baby’s had. His nos
and mouth wr twistd to on sid. This soldir was looking at th
cathdral and crossing himslf. Anothr, a young lad, a fair-haird
rcruit as whit as though thr was no blood in his thin fac, lookd
at Pirr kindly, with a fixd smil. Th third lay pron so that his
fac was not visibl. Th cavalry singrs wr passing clos by:
   Ah lost, quit lost... is my had so kn,
   Living in a forign land...
thy sang thir soldirs’ danc song.
As if rsponding to thm but with a diffrnt sort of mrrimnt, th
mtallic sound of th blls rvrbratd high abov and th hot rays of
th sun bathd th top of th opposit slop with yt anothr sort of
mrrimnt. But bnath th slop, by th cart with th woundd nar th
panting littl nag whr Pirr stood, it was damp, sombr, and sad.
Th soldir with th swolln chk lookd angrily at th cavalry
singrs.
“Oh, th coxcombs!” h muttrd rproachfully.
“It’s not th soldirs only, but I’v sn pasants today, too....
Th pasants—vn thy hav to go,” said th soldir bhind th cart,
addrssing Pirr with a sad smil. “No distinctions mad nowadays....
Thy want th whol nation to fall on thm—in a word, it’s Moscow! Thy
want to mak an nd of it.”
In spit of th obscurity of th soldir’s words Pirr undrstood what
h wantd to say and noddd approval.
Th road was clar again; Pirr dscndd th hill and drov on.
H kpt looking to ithr sid of th road for familiar facs, but only
saw vrywhr th unfamiliar facs of various military mn of diffrnt
branchs of th srvic, who all lookd with astonishmnt at his whit
hat and grn tail coat.
Having gon narly thr mils h at last mt an acquaintanc and
agrly addrssd him. This was on of th had army doctors. H was
driving toward Pirr in a covrd gig, sitting bsid a young surgon,
and on rcognizing Pirr h told th Cossack who occupid th drivr’s
sat to pull up.
“Count! Your xcllncy, how com you to b hr?” askd th doctor.
“Wll, you know, I wantd to s...”
“Ys, ys, thr will b somthing to s....”
Pirr got out and talkd to th doctor, xplaining his intntion of
taking part in a battl.
Th doctor advisd him to apply dirct to Kutúzov.
“Why should you b God knows whr out of sight, during th battl?” h
said, xchanging glancs with his young companion. “Anyhow his Srn
Highnss knows you and will rciv you graciously. That’s what you must
do.”
Th doctor smd tird and in a hurry.
“You think so?... Ah, I also wantd to ask you whr our position is
xactly?” said Pirr.
“Th position?” rpatd th doctor. “Wll, that’s not my lin. Driv
past Tatárinova, a lot of digging is going on thr. Go up th hillock
and you’ll s.”
“Can on s from thr?... If you would...”
But th doctor intrruptd him and movd toward his gig.
“I would go with you but on my honor I’m up to hr”—and h pointd to
his throat. “I’m galloping to th commandr of th corps. How do mattrs
stand?... You know, Count, thr’ll b a battl tomorrow. Out of an army
of a hundrd thousand w must xpct at last twnty thousand woundd,
and w havn’t strtchrs, or bunks, or drssrs, or doctors nough for
six thousand. W hav tn thousand carts, but w nd othr things as
wll—w must manag as bst w can!”
Th strang thought that of th thousands of mn, young and old, who
had stard with mrry surpris at his hat (prhaps th vry mn h had
noticd), twnty thousand wr invitably doomd to wounds and dath
amazd Pirr.
“Thy may di tomorrow; why ar thy thinking of anything but dath?”
And by som latnt squnc of thought th dscnt of th Mozháysk hill,
th carts with th woundd, th ringing blls, th slanting rays of th
sun, and th songs of th cavalrymn vividly rcurrd to his mind.
“Th cavalry rid to battl and mt th woundd and do not for a momnt
think of what awaits thm, but pass by, winking at th woundd. Yt from
among ths mn twnty thousand ar doomd to di, and thy wondr at my
hat! Strang!” thought Pirr, continuing his way to Tatárinova.
In front of a landownr’s hous to th lft of th road stood carriags,
wagons, and crowds of ordrlis and sntinls. Th commandr in chif
was putting up thr, but just whn Pirr arrivd h was not in and
hardly any of th staff wr thr—thy had gon to th church srvic.
Pirr drov on toward Górki.
Whn h had ascndd th hill and rachd th littl villag strt, h
saw for th first tim pasant militiamn in thir whit shirts and with
crosss on thir caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animatd and
prspiring, wr at work on a hug knoll ovrgrown with grass to th
right of th road.
Som of thm wr digging, othrs wr whling barrowloads of arth
along planks, whil othrs stood about doing nothing.
Two officrs wr standing on th knoll, dircting th mn. On sing
ths pasants, who wr vidntly still amusd by th novlty of thir
position as soldirs, Pirr onc mor thought of th woundd mn at
Mozháysk and undrstood what th soldir had mant whn h said: “Thy
want th whol nation to fall on thm.” Th sight of ths bardd
pasants at work on th battlfild, with thir qur, clumsy boots
and prspiring ncks, and thir shirts opning from th lft toward
th middl, unfastnd, xposing thir sunburnd collarbons, imprssd
Pirr mor strongly with th solmnity and importanc of th momnt
than anything h had yt sn or hard.
CHAPTR XXI
Pirr stppd out of his carriag and, passing th toiling militiamn,
ascndd th knoll from which, according to th doctor, th battlfild
could b sn.
It was about lvn o’clock. Th sun shon somwhat to th lft and
bhind him and brightly lit up th normous panorama which, rising lik
an amphithatr, xtndd bfor him in th clar rarfid atmosphr.
From abov on th lft, biscting that amphithatr, wound th Smolnsk
highroad, passing through a villag with a whit church som fiv
hundrd pacs in front of th knoll and blow it. This was Borodinó.
Blow th villag th road crossd th rivr by a bridg and, winding
down and up, ros highr and highr to th villag of Valúvo visibl
about four mils away, whr Napolon was thn stationd. Byond Valúvo
th road disappard into a yllowing forst on th horizon. Far in
th distanc in that birch and fir forst to th right of th road, th
cross and blfry of th Kolochá Monastry glamd in th sun. Hr and
thr ovr th whol of that blu xpans, to right and lft of th
forst and th road, smoking campfirs could b sn and indfinit
masss of troops—ours and th nmy’s. Th ground to th right—along th
cours of th Kolochá and Moskvá rivrs—was brokn and hilly. Btwn
th hollows th villags of Bzúbova and Zakhárino showd in th
distanc. On th lft th ground was mor lvl; thr wr filds of
grain, and th smoking ruins of Smënovsk, which had bn burnd down,
could b sn.
All that Pirr saw was so indfinit that nithr th lft nor th
right sid of th fild fully satisfid his xpctations. Nowhr
could h s th battlfild h had xpctd to find, but only filds,
madows, troops, woods, th smok of campfirs, villags, mounds, and
strams; and try as h would h could dscry no military “position” in
this plac which tmd with lif, nor could h vn distinguish our
troops from th nmy’s.
“I must ask somon who knows,” h thought, and addrssd an officr who
was looking with curiosity at his hug unmilitary figur.
“May I ask you,” said Pirr, “what villag that is in front?”
“Búrdino, isn’t it?” said th officr, turning to his companion.
“Borodinó,” th othr corrctd him.
Th officr, vidntly glad of an opportunity for a talk, movd up to
Pirr.
“Ar thos our mn thr?” Pirr inquird.
“Ys, and thr, furthr on, ar th Frnch,” said th officr. “Thr
thy ar, thr... you can s thm.”
“Whr? Whr?” askd Pirr.
“On can s thm with th nakd y... Why, thr!”
Th officr pointd with his hand to th smok visibl on th lft
byond th rivr, and th sam strn and srious xprssion that Pirr
had noticd on many of th facs h had mt cam into his fac.
“Ah, thos ar th Frnch! And ovr thr?...” Pirr pointd to a knoll
on th lft, nar which som troops could b sn.
“Thos ar ours.”
“Ah, ours! And thr?...” Pirr pointd to anothr knoll in th
distanc with a big tr on it, nar a villag that lay in a hollow
whr also som campfirs wr smoking and somthing black was visibl.
“That’s his again,” said th officr. (It was th Shvárdino Rdoubt.)
“It was ours ystrday, but now it is his.”
“Thn how about our position?”
“Our position?” rplid th officr with a smil of satisfaction. “I
can tll you quit clarly, bcaus I constructd narly all our
ntrnchmnts. Thr, you s? Thr’s our cntr, at Borodinó, just
thr,” and h pointd to th villag in front of thm with th whit
church. “That’s whr on crosss th Kolochá. You s down thr whr
th rows of hay ar lying in th hollow, thr’s th bridg. That’s our
cntr. Our right flank is ovr thr”—h pointd sharply to th right,
far away in th brokn ground—“That’s whr th Moskvá Rivr is, and
w hav thrown up thr rdoubts thr, vry strong ons. Th lft
flank...” hr th officr pausd. “Wll, you s, that’s difficult to
xplain.... Ystrday our lft flank was thr at Shvárdino, you s,
whr th oak is, but now w hav withdrawn our lft wing—now it is ovr
thr, do you s that villag and th smok? That’s Smënovsk, ys,
thr,” h pointd to Ravski’s knoll. “But th battl will hardly
b thr. His having movd his troops thr is only a rus; h will
probably pass round to th right of th Moskvá. But whrvr it may b,
many a man will b missing tomorrow!” h rmarkd.
An ldrly srgant who had approachd th officr whil h was giving
ths xplanations had waitd in silnc for him to finish spaking, but
at this point, vidntly not liking th officr’s rmark, intrruptd
him.
“Gabions must b snt for,” said h strnly.
Th officr appard abashd, as though h undrstood that on might
think of how many mn would b missing tomorrow but ought not to spak
of it.
“Wll, snd numbr thr company again,” th officr rplid hurridly.
“And you, ar you on of th doctors?”
“No, I’v com on my own,” answrd Pirr, and h wnt down th hill
again, passing th militiamn.
“Oh, thos damnd fllows!” muttrd th officr who followd him,
holding his nos as h ran past th mn at work.
“Thr thy ar... bringing hr, coming... Thr thy ar... Thy’ll b
hr in a minut...” voics wr suddnly hard saying; and officrs,
soldirs, and militiamn bgan running forward along th road.
A church procssion was coming up th hill from Borodinó. First along
th dusty road cam th infantry in ranks, barhadd and with arms
rvrsd. From bhind thm cam th sound of church singing.
Soldirs and militiamn ran barhadd past Pirr toward th
procssion.
“Thy ar bringing hr, our Protctrss!... Th Ibrian Mothr of God!”
somon crid.
“Th Smolnsk Mothr of God,” anothr corrctd him.
Th militiamn, both thos who had bn in th villag and thos who had
bn at work on th battry, thrw down thir spads and ran to mt th
church procssion. Following th battalion that marchd along th dusty
road cam prists in thir vstmnts—on littl old man in a hood with
attndants and singrs. Bhind thm soldirs and officrs bor a larg,
dark-facd icon with an mbossd mtal covr. This was th icon that had
bn brought from Smolnsk and had sinc accompanid th army. Bhind,
bfor, and on both sids, crowds of militiamn with bard hads walkd,
ran, and bowd to th ground.
At th summit of th hill thy stoppd with th icon; th mn who had
bn holding it up by th linn bands attachd to it wr rlivd by
othrs, th chantrs rlit thir cnsrs, and srvic bgan. Th hot
rays of th sun bat down vrtically and a frsh soft wind playd with
th hair of th bard hads and with th ribbons dcorating th icon.
Th singing did not sound loud undr th opn sky. An immns crowd
of barhadd officrs, soldirs, and militiamn surroundd th icon.
Bhind th prist and a chantr stood th notabilitis on a spot
rsrvd for thm. A bald gnral with a St. Gorg’s Cross on his nck
stood just bhind th prist’s back, and without crossing himslf (h
was vidntly a Grman) patintly awaitd th nd of th srvic, which
h considrd it ncssary to har to th nd, probably to arous th
patriotism of th Russian popl. Anothr gnral stood in a martial
pos, crossing himslf by shaking his hand in front of his chst
whil looking about him. Standing among th crowd of pasants, Pirr
rcognizd svral acquaintancs among ths notabls, but did not
look at thm—his whol attntion was absorbd in watching th srious
xprssion on th facs of th crowd of soldirs and militiamn who wr
all gazing agrly at th icon. As soon as th tird chantrs, who wr
singing th srvic for th twntith tim that day, bgan lazily and
mchanically to sing: “Sav from calamity Thy srvants, O Mothr of
God,” and th prist and dacon chimd in: “For to Th undr God w all
fl as to an inviolabl bulwark and protction,” thr again kindld in
all thos facs th sam xprssion of consciousnss of th solmnity
of th impnding momnt that Pirr had sn on th facs at th foot of
th hill at Mozháysk and momntarily on many and many facs h had mt
that morning; and hads wr bowd mor frquntly and hair tossd back,
and sighs and th sound mn mad as thy crossd thmslvs wr hard.
Th crowd round th icon suddnly partd and prssd against Pirr.
Somon, a vry important prsonag judging by th hast with which way
was mad for him, was approaching th icon.
It was Kutúzov, who had bn riding round th position and on his way
back to Tatárinova had stoppd whr th srvic was bing hld. Pirr
rcognizd him at onc by his pculiar figur, which distinguishd him
from vrybody ls.
With a long ovrcoat on his xcdingly stout, round-shouldrd body,
with uncovrd whit had and puffy fac showing th whit ball of th
y h had lost, Kutúzov walkd with plunging, swaying gait into
th crowd and stoppd bhind th prist. H crossd himslf with an
accustomd movmnt, bnt till h touchd th ground with his hand, and
bowd his whit had with a dp sigh. Bhind Kutúzov was Bnnigsn and
th suit. Dspit th prsnc of th commandr in chif, who attractd
th attntion of all th suprior officrs, th militiamn and soldirs
continud thir prayrs without looking at him.
Whn th srvic was ovr, Kutúzov stppd up to th icon, sank havily
to his kns, bowd to th ground, and for a long tim trid vainly to
ris, but could not do so on account of his waknss and wight. His
whit had twitchd with th ffort. At last h ros, kissd th icon as
a child dos with naïvly pouting lips, and again bowd till h touchd
th ground with his hand. Th othr gnrals followd his xampl,
thn th officrs, and aftr thm with xcitd facs, prssing on on
anothr, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambld th soldirs and
militiamn.
CHAPTR XXII
Staggring amid th crush, Pirr lookd about him.
“Count Ptr Kirílovich! How did you gt hr?” said a voic.
Pirr lookd round. Borís Drubtskóy, brushing his kns with his hand
(h had probably soild thm whn h, too, had knlt bfor th icon),
cam up to him smiling. Borís was lgantly drssd, with a slightly
martial touch appropriat to a campaign. H wor a long coat and lik
Kutúzov had a whip slung across his shouldr.
Manwhil Kutúzov had rachd th villag and satd himslf in th
shad of th narst hous, on a bnch which on Cossack had run
to ftch and anothr had hastily covrd with a rug. An immns and
brilliant suit surroundd him.
Th icon was carrid furthr, accompanid by th throng. Pirr stoppd
som thirty pacs from Kutúzov, talking to Borís.
H xplaind his wish to b prsnt at th battl and to s th
position.
“This is what you must do,” said Borís. “I will do th honors of th
camp to you. You will s vrything bst from whr Count Bnnigsn
will b. I am in attndanc on him, you know; I’ll mntion it to him.
But if you want to rid round th position, com along with us. W ar
just going to th lft flank. Thn whn w gt back, do spnd th night
with m and w’ll arrang a gam of cards. Of cours you know Dmítri
Srgvich? Thos ar his quartrs,” and h pointd to th third hous
in th villag of Górki.
“But I should lik to s th right flank. Thy say it’s vry strong,”
said Pirr. “I should lik to start from th Moskvá Rivr and rid
round th whol position.”
“Wll, you can do that latr, but th chif thing is th lft flank.”
“Ys, ys. But whr is Princ Bolkónski’s rgimnt? Can you point it
out to m?”
“Princ Andrw’s? W shall pass it and I’ll tak you to him.”
“What about th lft flank?” askd Pirr
“To tll you th truth, btwn ourslvs, God only knows what stat our
lft flank is in,” said Borís confidntially lowring his voic. “It is
not at all what Count Bnnigsn intndd. H mant to fortify that knoll
quit diffrntly, but...” Borís shruggd his shouldrs, “his Srn
Highnss would not hav it, or somon prsuadd him. You s...” but
Borís did not finish, for at that momnt Kaysárov, Kutúzov’s adjutant,
cam up to Pirr. “Ah, Kaysárov!” said Borís, addrssing him with an
unmbarrassd smil, “I was just trying to xplain our position to
th count. It is amazing how his Srn Highnss could so fors th
intntions of th Frnch!”
“You man th lft flank?” askd Kaysárov.
“Ys, xactly; th lft flank is now xtrmly strong.”
Though Kutúzov had dismissd all unncssary mn from th staff, Borís
had contrivd to rmain at hadquartrs aftr th changs. H had
stablishd himslf with Count Bnnigsn, who, lik all on whom Borís
had bn in attndanc, considrd young Princ Drubtskóy an invaluabl
man.
In th highr command thr wr two sharply dfind partis: Kutúzov’s
party and that of Bnnigsn, th chif of staff. Borís blongd to th
lattr and no on ls, whil showing srvil rspct to Kutúzov, could
so crat an imprssion that th old fllow was not much good and that
Bnnigsn managd vrything. Now th dcisiv momnt of battl had com
whn Kutúzov would b dstroyd and th powr pass to Bnnigsn, or vn
if Kutúzov won th battl it would b flt that vrything was don by
Bnnigsn. In any cas many grat rwards would hav to b givn for
tomorrow’s action, and nw mn would com to th front. So Borís was
full of nrvous vivacity all day.
Aftr Kaysárov, othrs whom Pirr knw cam up to him, and h had not
tim to rply to all th qustions about Moscow that wr showrd upon
him, or to listn to all that was told him. Th facs all xprssd
animation and apprhnsion, but it smd to Pirr that th caus of
th xcitmnt shown in som of ths facs lay chifly in qustions
of prsonal succss; his mind, howvr, was occupid by th diffrnt
xprssion h saw on othr facs—an xprssion that spok not of
prsonal mattrs but of th univrsal qustions of lif and dath.
Kutúzov noticd Pirr’s figur and th group gathrd round him.
“Call him to m,” said Kutúzov.
An adjutant told Pirr of his Srn Highnss’ wish, and Pirr wnt
toward Kutúzov’s bnch. But a militiaman got thr bfor him. It was
Dólokhov.
“How did that fllow gt hr?” askd Pirr.
“H’s a cratur that wriggls in anywhr!” was th answr. “H
has bn dgradd, you know. Now h wants to bob up again. H’s bn
proposing som schm or othr and has crawld into th nmy’s pickt
lin at night.... H’s a brav fllow.”
Pirr took off his hat and bowd rspctfully to Kutúzov.
“I concludd that if I rportd to your Srn Highnss you might snd
m away or say that you knw what I was rporting, but thn I shouldn’t
los anything...” Dólokhov was saying.
“Ys, ys.”
“But if I wr right, I should b rndring a srvic to my Fathrland
for which I am rady to di.”
“Ys, ys.”
“And should your Srn Highnss rquir a man who will not spar his
skin, plas think of m.... Prhaps I may prov usful to your Srn
Highnss.”
“Ys... Ys...” Kutúzov rpatd, his laughing y narrowing mor and
mor as h lookd at Pirr.
Just thn Borís, with his courtirlik adroitnss, stppd up to
Pirr’s sid nar Kutúzov and in a most natural mannr, without
raising his voic, said to Pirr, as though continuing an intrruptd
convrsation:
“Th militia hav put on clan whit shirts to b rady to di. What
hroism, Count!”
Borís vidntly said this to Pirr in ordr to b ovrhard by his
Srn Highnss. H knw Kutúzov’s attntion would b caught by thos
words, and so it was.
“What ar you saying about th militia?” h askd Borís.
“Prparing for tomorrow, your Srn Highnss—for dath—thy hav put on
clan shirts.”
“Ah... a wondrful, a matchlss popl!” said Kutúzov; and h closd his
ys and swayd his had. “A matchlss popl!” h rpatd with a sigh.
“So you want to smll gunpowdr?” h said to Pirr. “Ys, it’s a
plasant smll. I hav th honor to b on of your wif’s adorrs. Is
sh wll? My quartrs ar at your srvic.”
And as oftn happns with old popl, Kutúzov bgan looking about
absnt-minddly as if forgtting all h wantd to say or do.
Thn, vidntly rmmbring what h wantd, h bckond to Andrw
Kaysárov, his adjutant’s brothr.
“Thos vrss... thos vrss of Márin’s... how do thy go, h? Thos h
wrot about Grákov: ‘Lcturs for th corps inditing’... Rcit thm,
rcit thm!” said h, vidntly prparing to laugh.
Kaysárov rcitd.... Kutúzov smilingly noddd his had to th rhythm of
th vrss.
Whn Pirr had lft Kutúzov, Dólokhov cam up to him and took his hand.
“I am vry glad to mt you hr, Count,” h said aloud, rgardlss
of th prsnc of strangrs and in a particularly rsolut and solmn
ton. “On th v of a day whn God alon knows who of us is fatd to
surviv, I am glad of this opportunity to tll you that I rgrt th
misundrstandings that occurrd btwn us and should wish you not to
hav any ill fling for m. I bg you to forgiv m.”
Pirr lookd at Dólokhov with a smil, not knowing what to say to him.
With tars in his ys Dólokhov mbracd Pirr and kissd him.
Borís said a fw words to his gnral, and Count Bnnigsn turnd to
Pirr and proposd that h should rid with him along th lin.
“It will intrst you,” said h.
“Ys, vry much,” rplid Pirr.
Half an hour latr Kutúzov lft for Tatárinova, and Bnnigsn and his
suit, with Pirr among thm, st out on thir rid along th lin.

From Górki, Bnnigsn dscndd th highroad to th bridg which, whn
thy had lookd at it from th hill, th officr had pointd out as
bing th cntr of our position and whr rows of fragrant nw-mown hay
lay by th rivrsid. Thy rod across that bridg into th villag of
Borodinó and thnc turnd to th lft, passing an normous numbr of
troops and guns, and cam to a high knoll whr militiamn wr digging.
This was th rdoubt, as yt unnamd, which aftrwards bcam known as
th Ravski Rdoubt, or th Knoll Battry, but Pirr paid no spcial
attntion to it. H did not know that it would bcom mor mmorabl to
him than any othr spot on th plain of Borodinó.
Thy thn crossd th hollow to Smënovsk, whr th soldirs wr
dragging away th last logs from th huts and barns. Thn thy rod
downhill and uphill, across a ryfild troddn and batn down as if by
hail, following a track frshly mad by th artillry ovr th furrows
of th plowd land, and rachd som flèchs * which wr still bing
dug.
    * A kind of ntrnchmnt.
At th flèchs Bnnigsn stoppd and bgan looking at th Shvárdino
Rdoubt opposit, which had bn ours th day bfor and whr svral
horsmn could b dscrid. Th officrs said that ithr Napolon or
Murat was thr, and thy all gazd agrly at this littl group of
horsmn. Pirr also lookd at thm, trying to guss which of th
scarcly discrnibl figurs was Napolon. At last thos mountd mn
rod away from th mound and disappard.
Bnnigsn spok to a gnral who approachd him, and bgan xplaining
th whol position of our troops. Pirr listnd to him, straining ach
faculty to undrstand th ssntial points of th impnding battl, but
was mortifid to fl that his mntal capacity was inadquat for th
task. H could mak nothing of it. Bnnigsn stoppd spaking and,
noticing that Pirr was listning, suddnly said to him:
“I don’t think this intrsts you?”
“On th contrary it’s vry intrsting!” rplid Pirr not quit
truthfully.
From th flèchs thy rod still farthr to th lft, along a road
winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In th middl of th
wood a brown har with whit ft sprang out and, scard by th tramp of
th many horss, grw so confusd that it lapd along th road in front
of thm for som tim, arousing gnral attntion and laughtr, and only
whn svral voics shoutd at it did it dart to on sid and disappar
in th thickt. Aftr going through th wood for about a mil and a half
thy cam out on a glad whr troops of Túchkov’s corps wr stationd
to dfnd th lft flank.
Hr, at th xtrm lft flank, Bnnigsn talkd a grat dal and with
much hat, and, as it smd to Pirr, gav ordrs of grat military
importanc. In front of Túchkov’s troops was som high ground not
occupid by troops. Bnnigsn loudly criticizd this mistak, saying
that it was madnss to lav a hight which commandd th country around
unoccupid and to plac troops blow it. Som of th gnrals xprssd
th sam opinion. On in particular dclard with martial hat that thy
wr put thr to b slaughtrd. Bnnigsn on his own authority ordrd
th troops to occupy th high ground. This disposition on th lft flank
incrasd Pirr’s doubt of his own capacity to undrstand military
mattrs. Listning to Bnnigsn and th gnrals criticizing th
position of th troops bhind th hill, h quit undrstood thm and
shard thir opinion, but for that vry rason h could not undrstand
how th man who put thm thr bhind th hill could hav mad so gross
and palpabl a blundr.
Pirr did not know that ths troops wr not, as Bnnigsn supposd,
put thr to dfnd th position, but wr in a concald position as
an ambush, that thy should not b sn and might b abl to strik an
approaching nmy unxpctdly. Bnnigsn did not know this and movd
th troops forward according to his own idas without mntioning th
mattr to th commandr in chif.
CHAPTR XXIV
On that bright vning of August 25, Princ Andrw lay laning on his
lbow in a brokn-down shd in th villag of Knyazkóvo at th furthr
nd of his rgimnt’s ncampmnt. Through a gap in th brokn wall h
could s, bsid th woodn fnc, a row of thirty-yar-old birchs
with thir lowr branchs loppd off, a fild on which shocks of
oats wr standing, and som bushs nar which ros th smok of
campfirs—th soldirs’ kitchns.
Narrow and burdnsom and uslss to anyon as his lif now smd to
him, Princ Andrw on th v of battl flt agitatd and irritabl as
h had don svn yars bfor at Austrlitz.
H had rcivd and givn th ordrs for nxt day’s battl and had
nothing mor to do. But his thoughts—th simplst, clarst, and
thrfor most trribl thoughts—would giv him no pac. H knw that
tomorrow’s battl would b th most trribl of all h had takn
part in, and for th first tim in his lif th possibility of dath
prsntd itslf to him—not in rlation to any worldly mattr or with
rfrnc to its ffct on othrs, but simply in rlation to himslf, to
his own soul—vividly, plainly, trribly, and almost as a crtainty. And
from th hight of this prcption all that had prviously tormntd and
proccupid him suddnly bcam illumind by a cold whit light without
shadows, without prspctiv, without distinction of outlin. All lif
appard to him lik magic-lantrn picturs at which h had long bn
gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now h suddnly saw thos
badly daubd picturs in clar daylight and without a glass. “Ys,
ys! Thr thy ar, thos fals imags that agitatd, nrapturd,
and tormntd m,” said h to himslf, passing in rviw th principal
picturs of th magic lantrn of lif and rgarding thm now in th cold
whit daylight of his clar prcption of dath. “Thr thy ar, thos
rudly paintd figurs that onc smd splndid and mystrious.
Glory, th good of socity, lov of a woman, th Fathrland itslf—how
important ths picturs appard to m, with what profound maning thy
smd to b filld! And it is all so simpl, pal, and crud in th
cold whit light of this morning which I fl is dawning for m.” Th
thr grat sorrows of his lif hld his attntion in particular: his
lov for a woman, his fathr’s dath, and th Frnch invasion which had
ovrrun half Russia. “Lov... that littl girl who smd to m brimming
ovr with mystic forcs! Ys, indd, I lovd hr. I mad romantic plans
of lov and happinss with hr! Oh, what a boy I was!” h said aloud
bittrly. “Ah m! I blivd in som idal lov which was to kp hr
faithful to m for th whol yar of my absnc! Lik th gntl dov
in th fabl sh was to pin apart from m.... But it was much simplr
rally.... It was all vry simpl and horribl.”
“Whn my fathr built Bald Hills h thought th plac was his: his
land, his air, his pasants. But Napolon cam and swpt him asid,
unconscious of his xistnc, as h might brush a chip from his path,
and his Bald Hills and his whol lif fll to pics. Princss Mary says
it is a trial snt from abov. What is th trial for, whn h is not
hr and will nvr rturn? H is not hr! For whom thn is th trial
intndd? Th Fathrland, th dstruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I
shall b killd, prhaps not vn by a Frnchman but by on of our own
mn, by a soldir discharging a muskt clos to my ar as on of thm
did ystrday, and th Frnch will com and tak m by had and hls
and fling m into a hol that I may not stink undr thir noss, and nw
conditions of lif will aris, which will sm quit ordinary to othrs
and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not xist....”
H lookd at th row of birchs shining in th sunshin, with thir
motionlss grn and yllow foliag and whit bark. “To di... to b
killd tomorrow... That I should not xist... That all this should still
b, but no m....”
And th birchs with thir light and shad, th curly clouds, th
smok of th campfirs, and all that was around him changd and smd
trribl and mnacing. A cold shivr ran down his spin. H ros
quickly, wnt out of th shd, and bgan to walk about.
Aftr h had rturnd, voics wr hard outsid th shd. “Who’s that?”
h crid.
Th rd-nosd Captain Timókhin, formrly Dólokhov’s squadron commandr,
but now from lack of officrs a battalion commandr, shyly ntrd th
shd followd by an adjutant and th rgimntal paymastr.
Princ Andrw ros hastily, listnd to th businss thy had com
about, gav thm som furthr instructions, and was about to dismiss
thm whn h hard a familiar, lisping, voic bhind th shd.
“Dvil tak it!” said th voic of a man stumbling ovr somthing.
Princ Andrw lookd out of th shd and saw Pirr, who had trippd
ovr a pol on th ground and had narly falln, coming his way. It was
unplasant to Princ Andrw to mt popl of his own st in gnral,
and Pirr spcially, for h rmindd him of all th painful momnts of
his last visit to Moscow.
“You? What a surpris!” said h. “What brings you hr? This is
unxpctd!”
As h said this his ys and fac xprssd mor than coldnss—thy
xprssd hostility, which Pirr noticd at onc. H had approachd
th shd full of animation, but on sing Princ Andrw’s fac h flt
constraind and ill at as.
“I hav com... simply... you know... com... it intrsts m,” said
Pirr, who had so oftn that day snslssly rpatd that word
“intrsting.” “I wish to s th battl.”
“Oh ys, and what do th Masonic brothrs say about war? How would thy
stop it?” said Princ Andrw sarcastically. “Wll, and how’s Moscow? And
my popl? Hav thy rachd Moscow at last?” h askd sriously.
“Ys, thy hav. Juli Drubtskáya told m so. I wnt to s thm, but
missd thm. Thy hav gon to your stat nar Moscow.”
CHAPTR XXV
Th officrs wr about to tak lav, but Princ Andrw, apparntly
rluctant to b lft alon with his frind, askd thm to stay and hav
ta. Sats wr brought in and so was th ta. Th officrs gazd with
surpris at Pirr’s hug stout figur and listnd to his talk of
Moscow and th position of our army, round which h had riddn. Princ
Andrw rmaind silnt, and his xprssion was so forbidding that Pirr
addrssd his rmarks chifly to th good-naturd battalion commandr.
“So you undrstand th whol position of our troops?” Princ Andrw
intrruptd him.
“Ys—that is, how do you man?” said Pirr. “Not bing a military man
I can’t say I hav undrstood it fully, but I undrstand th gnral
position.”
“Wll, thn, you know mor than anyon ls, b it who it may,” said
Princ Andrw.
“Oh!” said Pirr, looking ovr his spctacls in prplxity at Princ
Andrw. “Wll, and what do you think of Kutúzov’s appointmnt?” h
askd.
“I was vry glad of his appointmnt, that’s all I know,” rplid Princ
Andrw.
“And tll m your opinion of Barclay d Tolly. In Moscow thy ar saying
havn knows what about him.... What do you think of him?”
“Ask thm,” rplid Princ Andrw, indicating th officrs.
Pirr lookd at Timókhin with th condscndingly intrrogativ smil
with which vrybody involuntarily addrssd that officr.
“W s light again, sinc his Srnity has bn appointd, your
xcllncy,” said Timókhin timidly, and continually turning to glanc at
his colonl.
“Why so?” askd Pirr.
“Wll, to mntion only firwood and foddr, lt m inform you. Why, whn
w wr rtrating from Svntsyáni w dar not touch a stick or a wisp
of hay or anything. You s, w wr going away, so h would gt it all;
wasn’t it so, your xcllncy?” and again Timókhin turnd to th princ.
“But w darn’t. In our rgimnt two officrs wr court-martiald for
that kind of thing. But whn his Srnity took command vrything bcam
straightforward. Now w s light....”
“Thn why was it forbiddn?”
Timókhin lookd about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answr
such a qustion. Pirr put th sam qustion to Princ Andrw.
“Why, so as not to lay wast th country w wr abandoning to th
nmy,” said Princ Andrw with vnomous irony. “It is vry sound:
on can’t prmit th land to b pillagd and accustom th troops to
marauding. At Smolnsk too h judgd corrctly that th Frnch might
outflank us, as thy had largr forcs. But h could not undrstand
this,” crid Princ Andrw in a shrill voic that smd to scap him
involuntarily: “h could not undrstand that thr, for th first tim,
w wr fighting for Russian soil, and that thr was a spirit in th
mn such as I had nvr sn bfor, that w had hld th Frnch for
two days, and that that succss had incrasd our strngth tnfold. H
ordrd us to rtrat, and all our fforts and losss wnt for nothing.
H had no thought of btraying us, h trid to do th bst h could,
h thought out vrything, and that is why h is unsuitabl. H is
unsuitabl now, just bcaus h plans out vrything vry thoroughly and
accuratly as vry Grman has to. How can I xplain?... Wll, say your
fathr has a Grman valt, and h is a splndid valt and satisfis your
fathr’s rquirmnts bttr than you could, thn it’s all right to lt
him srv. But if your fathr is mortally sick you’ll snd th valt
away and attnd to your fathr with your own unpracticd, awkward hands,
and will sooth him bttr than a skilld man who is a strangr could.
So it has bn with Barclay. Whil Russia was wll, a forignr could
srv hr and b a splndid ministr; but as soon as sh is in dangr
sh nds on of hr own kin. But in your Club thy hav bn making him
out a traitor! Thy slandr him as a traitor, and th only rsult will
b that aftrwards, ashamd of thir fals accusations, thy will mak
him out a hro or a gnius instad of a traitor, and that will b still
mor unjust. H is an honst and vry punctilious Grman.”
“And thy say h’s a skillful commandr,” rjoind Pirr.
“I don’t undrstand what is mant by ‘a skillful commandr,’” rplid
Princ Andrw ironically.
“A skillful commandr?” rplid Pirr. “Why, on who forss all
contingncis... and forss th advrsary’s intntions.”
“But that’s impossibl,” said Princ Andrw as if it wr a mattr
sttld long ago.
Pirr lookd at him in surpris.
“And yt thy say that war is lik a gam of chss?” h rmarkd.
“Ys,” rplid Princ Andrw, “but with this littl diffrnc, that
in chss you may think ovr ach mov as long as you plas and ar not
limitd for tim, and with this diffrnc too, that a knight is always
strongr than a pawn, and two pawns ar always strongr than on, whil
in war a battalion is somtims strongr than a division and somtims
wakr than a company. Th rlativ strngth of bodis of troops can
nvr b known to anyon. Bliv m,” h wnt on, “if things
dpndd on arrangmnts mad by th staff, I should b thr making
arrangmnts, but instad of that I hav th honor to srv hr in
th rgimnt with ths gntlmn, and I considr that on us tomorrow’s
battl will dpnd and not on thos othrs.... Succss nvr dpnds,
and nvr will dpnd, on position, or quipmnt, or vn on numbrs,
and last of all on position.”
“But on what thn?”
“On th fling that is in m and in him,” h pointd to Timókhin, “and
in ach soldir.”
Princ Andrw glancd at Timókhin, who lookd at his commandr in alarm
and bwildrmnt. In contrast to his formr rticnt taciturnity
Princ Andrw now smd xcitd. H could apparntly not rfrain from
xprssing th thoughts that had suddnly occurrd to him.
“A battl is won by thos who firmly rsolv to win it! Why did w los
th battl at Austrlitz? Th Frnch losss wr almost qual to ours,
but vry arly w said to ourslvs that w wr losing th battl,
and w did los it. And w said so bcaus w had nothing to fight for
thr, w wantd to gt away from th battlfild as soon as w could.
‘W’v lost, so lt us run,’ and w ran. If w had not said that till
th vning, havn knows what might not hav happnd. But tomorrow w
shan’t say it! You talk about our position, th lft flank wak and th
right flank too xtndd,” h wnt on. “That’s all nonsns, thr’s
nothing of th kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundrd million most
divrs chancs which will b dcidd on th instant by th fact that
our mn or thirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is
killd, but all that is bing don at prsnt is only play. Th fact is
that thos mn with whom you hav riddn round th position not only
do not hlp mattrs, but hindr. Thy ar only concrnd with thir own
ptty intrsts.”
“At such a momnt?” said Pirr rproachfully.
“At such a momnt!” Princ Andrw rpatd. “To thm it is only a momnt
affording opportunitis to undrmin a rival and obtain an xtra cross
or ribbon. For m tomorrow mans this: a Russian army of a hundrd
thousand and a Frnch army of a hundrd thousand hav mt to fight, and
th thing is that ths two hundrd thousand mn will fight and th sid
that fights mor fircly and spars itslf last will win. And if you
lik I will tll you that whatvr happns and whatvr muddls thos at
th top may mak, w shall win tomorrow’s battl. Tomorrow, happn what
may, w shall win!”
“Thr now, your xcllncy! That’s th truth, th ral truth,” said
Timókhin. “Who would spar himslf now? Th soldirs in my battalion,
bliv m, wouldn’t drink thir vodka! ‘It’s not th day for that!’
thy say.”
All wr silnt. Th officrs ros. Princ Andrw wnt out of th shd
with thm, giving final ordrs to th adjutant. Aftr thy had gon
Pirr approachd Princ Andrw and was about to start a convrsation
whn thy hard th clattr of thr horss’ hoofs on th road not far
from th shd, and looking in that dirction Princ Andrw rcognizd
Wolzogn and Clauswitz accompanid by a Cossack. Thy rod clos by
continuing to convrs, and Princ Andrw involuntarily hard ths
words:
“Dr Krig muss in Raum vrlgt wrdn. Dr Ansicht kann ich nicht gnug
Pris gbn,” * said on of thm.
     * “Th war must b xtndd widly. I cannot sufficintly
     commnd that viw.”
“Oh, ja,” said th othr, “dr Zwck ist nur dn Find zu schwächn,
so kann man gwiss nicht dn Vrlust dr Privat-Prsonn in Achtung
nhmn.” *
     * “Oh, ys, th only aim is to wakn th nmy, so of
     cours on cannot tak into account th loss of privat
     individuals.”
“Oh, no,” agrd th othr.
“xtnd widly!” said Princ Andrw with an angry snort, whn thy had
riddn past. “In that ‘xtnd’ wr my fathr, son, and sistr, at Bald
Hills. That’s all th sam to him! That’s what I was saying to you—thos
Grman gntlmn won’t win th battl tomorrow but will only mak all
th mss thy can, bcaus thy hav nothing in thir Grman hads but
thoris not worth an mpty ggshll and havn’t in thir harts th on
thing ndd tomorrow—that which Timókhin has. Thy hav yildd up all
urop to him, and hav now com to tach us. Fin tachrs!” and again
his voic grw shrill.
“So you think w shall win tomorrow’s battl?” askd Pirr.
“Ys, ys,” answrd Princ Andrw absntly. “On thing I would do if
I had th powr,” h bgan again, “I would not tak prisonrs. Why tak
prisonrs? It’s chivalry! Th Frnch hav dstroyd my hom and ar on
thir way to dstroy Moscow, thy hav outragd and ar outraging m
vry momnt. Thy ar my nmis. In my opinion thy ar all criminals.
And so thinks Timókhin and th whol army. Thy should b xcutd!
Sinc thy ar my fos thy cannot b my frinds, whatvr may hav bn
said at Tilsit.”
“Ys, ys,” muttrd Pirr, looking with shining ys at Princ Andrw.
“I quit agr with you!”
Th qustion that had prturbd Pirr on th Mozháysk hill and all
that day now smd to him quit clar and compltly solvd. H now
undrstood th whol maning and importanc of this war and of th
impnding battl. All h had sn that day, all th significant and
strn xprssions on th facs h had sn in passing, wr lit up
for him by a nw light. H undrstood that latnt hat (as thy say in
physics) of patriotism which was prsnt in all ths mn h had sn,
and this xplaind to him why thy all prpard for dath calmly, and as
it wr lighthartdly.
“Not tak prisonrs,” Princ Andrw continud: “That by itslf would
quit chang th whol war and mak it lss crul. As it is w hav
playd at war—that’s what’s vil! W play at magnanimity and all that
stuff. Such magnanimity and snsibility ar lik th magnanimity and
snsibility of a lady who faints whn sh ss a calf bing killd: sh
is so kindhartd that sh can’t look at blood, but njoys ating th
calf srvd up with sauc. Thy talk to us of th ruls of war, of
chivalry, of flags of truc, of mrcy to th unfortunat and so on. It’s
all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truc in 1805; thy humbuggd
us and w humbuggd thm. Thy plundr othr popl’s houss, issu
fals papr mony, and worst of all thy kill my childrn and my
fathr, and thn talk of ruls of war and magnanimity to fos! Tak no
prisonrs, but kill and b killd! H who has com to this as I hav
through th sam suffrings...”
Princ Andrw, who had thought it was all th sam to him whthr or
not Moscow was takn as Smolnsk had bn, was suddnly chckd in his
spch by an unxpctd cramp in his throat. H pacd up and down a
fw tims in silnc, but his ys glittrd fvrishly and his lips
quivrd as h bgan spaking.
“If thr was non of this magnanimity in war, w should go to war only
whn it was worth whil going to crtain dath, as now. Thn thr would
not b war bcaus Paul Ivánovich had offndd Michal Ivánovich. And
whn thr was a war, lik this on, it would b war! And thn th
dtrmination of th troops would b quit diffrnt. Thn all ths
Wstphalians and Hssians whom Napolon is lading would not follow
him into Russia, and w should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia
without knowing why. War is not courtsy but th most horribl thing in
lif; and w ought to undrstand that and not play at war. W ought to
accpt this trribl ncssity strnly and sriously. It all lis in
that: gt rid of falshood and lt war b war and not a gam. As it is
now, war is th favorit pastim of th idl and frivolous. Th military
calling is th most highly honord.
“But what is war? What is ndd for succss in warfar? What ar th
habits of th military? Th aim of war is murdr; th mthods of war
ar spying, trachry, and thir ncouragmnt, th ruin of a country’s
inhabitants, robbing thm or staling to provision th army, and fraud
and falshood trmd military craft. Th habits of th military class
ar th absnc of frdom, that is, disciplin, idlnss, ignoranc,
crulty, dbauchry, and drunknnss. And in spit of all this it is th
highst class, rspctd by vryon. All th kings, xcpt th Chins,
war military uniforms, and h who kills most popl rcivs th
highst rwards.
“Thy mt, as w shall mt tomorrow, to murdr on anothr; thy kill
and maim tns of thousands, and thn hav thanksgiving srvics for
having killd so many popl (thy vn xaggrat th numbr), and thy
announc a victory, supposing that th mor popl thy hav killd
th gratr thir achivmnt. How dos God abov look at thm and har
thm?” xclaimd Princ Andrw in a shrill, pircing voic. “Ah, my
frind, it has of lat bcom hard for m to liv. I s that I hav
bgun to undrstand too much. And it dosn’t do for man to tast of th
tr of knowldg of good and vil.... Ah, wll, it’s not for long!” h
addd.
“Howvr, you’r slpy, and it’s tim for m to slp. Go back to
Górki!” said Princ Andrw suddnly.
“Oh no!” Pirr rplid, looking at Princ Andrw with frightnd,
compassionat ys.
“Go, go! Bfor a battl on must hav on’s slp out,” rpatd Princ
Andrw.
H cam quickly up to Pirr and mbracd and kissd him. “Good-by, b
off!” h shoutd. “Whthr w mt again or not...” and turning away
hurridly h ntrd th shd.
It was alrady dark, and Pirr could not mak out whthr th
xprssion of Princ Andrw’s fac was angry or tndr.
For som tim h stood in silnc considring whthr h should follow
him or go away. “No, h dos not want it!” Pirr concludd. “And I know
that this is our last mting!” H sighd dply and rod back to Górki.
On r-ntring th shd Princ Andrw lay down on a rug, but h could
not slp.
H closd his ys. On pictur succdd anothr in his imagination. On
on of thm h dwlt long and joyfully. H vividly rcalld an vning
in Ptrsburg. Natásha with animatd and xcitd fac was tlling him
how sh had gon to look for mushrooms th prvious summr and had lost
hr way in th big forst. Sh incohrntly dscribd th dpths of
th forst, hr flings, and a talk with a bkpr sh mt, and
constantly intrruptd hr story to say: “No, I can’t! I’m not tlling
it right; no, you don’t undrstand,” though h ncouragd hr by saying
that h did undrstand, and h rally had undrstood all sh wantd to
say. But Natásha was not satisfid with hr own words: sh flt that
thy did not convy th passionatly potic fling sh had xprincd
that day and wishd to convy. “H was such a dlightful old man, and
it was so dark in th forst... and h had such kind... No, I can’t
dscrib it,” sh had said, flushd and xcitd. Princ Andrw smild
now th sam happy smil as thn whn h had lookd into hr ys. “I
undrstood hr,” h thought. “I not only undrstood hr, but it was just
that innr, spiritual forc, that sincrity, that franknss of soul—that
vry soul of hrs which smd to b fttrd by hr body—it was that
soul I lovd in hr... lovd so strongly and happily...” and suddnly
h rmmbrd how his lov had ndd. “H did not nd anything of that
kind. H nithr saw nor undrstood anything of th sort. H only saw in
hr a prtty and frsh young girl, with whom h did not dign to unit
his fat. And I?... and h is still aliv and gay!”
Princ Andrw jumpd up as if somon had burnd him, and again bgan
pacing up and down in front of th shd.
CHAPTR XXVI
On August 25, th v of th battl of Borodinó, M. d Bausst, prfct
of th Frnch mpror’s palac, arrivd at Napolon’s quartrs at
Valúvo with Colonl Fabvir, th formr from Paris and th lattr from
Madrid.
Donning his court uniform, M. d Bausst ordrd a box h had
brought for th mpror to b carrid bfor him and ntrd th first
compartmnt of Napolon’s tnt, whr h bgan opning th box whil
convrsing with Napolon’s aids-d-camp who surroundd him.
Fabvir, not ntring th tnt, rmaind at th ntranc talking to som
gnrals of his acquaintanc.
Th mpror Napolon had not yt lft his bdroom and was finishing his
toilt. Slightly snorting and grunting, h prsntd now his back and
now his plump hairy chst to th brush with which his valt was rubbing
him down. Anothr valt, with his fingr ovr th mouth of a bottl,
was sprinkling au d Cologn on th mpror’s pamprd body with an
xprssion which smd to say that h alon knw whr and how much au
d Cologn should b sprinkld. Napolon’s short hair was wt and
mattd on th forhad, but his fac, though puffy and yllow, xprssd
physical satisfaction. “Go on, hardr, go on!” h muttrd to th valt
who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aid-d-camp,
who had ntrd th bdroom to rport to th mpror th numbr of
prisonrs takn in ystrday’s action, was standing by th door aftr
dlivring his mssag, awaiting prmission to withdraw. Napolon,
frowning, lookd at him from undr his brows.
“No prisonrs!” said h, rpating th aid-d-camp’s words. “Thy
ar forcing us to xtrminat thm. So much th wors for th Russian
army.... Go on... hardr, hardr!” h muttrd, hunching his back and
prsnting his fat shouldrs.
“All right. Lt Monsiur d Bausst ntr, and Fabvir too,” h said,
nodding to th aid-d-camp.
“Ys, sir,” and th aid-d-camp disappard through th door of th
tnt.
Two valts rapidly drssd His Majsty, and waring th blu uniform of
th Guards h wnt with firm quick stps to th rcption room.
D Bausst’s hands manwhil wr busily ngagd arranging th prsnt
h had brought from th mprss, on two chairs dirctly in front of th
ntranc. But Napolon had drssd and com out with such unxpctd
rapidity that h had not tim to finish arranging th surpris.
Napolon noticd at onc what thy wr about and gussd that thy wr
not rady. H did not wish to dpriv thm of th plasur of giving him
a surpris, so h prtndd not to s d Bausst and calld Fabvir to
him, listning silntly and with a strn frown to what Fabvir told him
of th hroism and dvotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at
th othr nd of urop, with but on thought—to b worthy of thir
mpror—and but on far—to fail to plas him. Th rsult of that
battl had bn dplorabl. Napolon mad ironic rmarks during
Fabvir’s account, as if h had not xpctd that mattrs could go
othrwis in his absnc.
“I must mak up for that in Moscow,” said Napolon. “I’ll s you
latr,” h addd, and summond d Bausst, who by that tim had
prpard th surpris, having placd somthing on th chairs and covrd
it with a cloth.
D Bausst bowd low, with that courtly Frnch bow which only th
old rtainrs of th Bourbons knw how to mak, and approachd him,
prsnting an nvlop.
Napolon turnd to him gaily and pulld his ar.
“You hav hurrid hr. I am vry glad. Wll, what is Paris saying?” h
askd, suddnly changing his formr strn xprssion for a most cordial
ton.
“Sir, all Paris rgrts your absnc,” rplid d Bausst as was
propr.
But though Napolon knw that d Bausst had to say somthing of this
kind, and though in his lucid momnts h knw it was untru, h was
plasd to har it from him. Again h honord him by touching his ar.
“I am vry sorry to hav mad you travl so far,” said h.
“Sir, I xpctd nothing lss than to find you at th gats of Moscow,”
rplid d Bausst.
Napolon smild and, lifting his had absnt-minddly, glancd to th
right. An aid-d-camp approachd with gliding stps and offrd him a
gold snuffbox, which h took.
“Ys, it has happnd luckily for you,” h said, raising th opn
snuffbox to his nos. “You ar fond of travl, and in thr days you
will s Moscow. You surly did not xpct to s that Asiatic capital.
You will hav a plasant journy.”
D Bausst bowd gratfully at this rgard for his tast for travl (of
which h had not till thn bn awar).
“Ha, what’s this?” askd Napolon, noticing that all th courtirs wr
looking at somthing concald undr a cloth.
With courtly adroitnss d Bausst half turnd and without turning his
back to th mpror rtird two stps, twitching off th cloth at th
sam tim, and said:
“A prsnt to Your Majsty from th mprss.”
It was a portrait, paintd in bright colors by Grard, of th son born
to Napolon by th daughtr of th mpror of Austria, th boy whom for
som rason vryon calld “Th King of Rom.”
A vry prtty curly-hadd boy with a look of th Christ in th Sistin
Madonna was dpictd playing at stick and ball. Th ball rprsntd th
trrstrial glob and th stick in his othr hand a scptr.
Though it was not clar what th artist mant to xprss by dpicting
th so-calld King of Rom spiking th arth with a stick, th allgory
apparntly smd to Napolon, as it had don to all who had sn it in
Paris, quit clar and vry plasing.
“Th King of Rom!” h said, pointing to th portrait with a gracful
gstur. “Admirabl!”
With th natural capacity of an Italian for changing th xprssion of
his fac at will, h drw narr to th portrait and assumd a look
of pnsiv tndrnss. H flt that what h now said and did would b
historical, and it smd to him that it would now b bst for him—whos
grandur nabld his son to play stick and ball with th trrstrial
glob—to show, in contrast to that grandur, th simplst patrnal
tndrnss. His ys grw dim, h movd forward, glancd round at a
chair (which smd to plac itslf undr him), and sat down on it
bfor th portrait. At a singl gstur from him vryon wnt out on
tipto, laving th grat man to himslf and his motion.
Having sat still for a whil h touchd—himslf not knowing why—th
thick spot of paint rprsnting th highst light in th portrait,
ros, and rcalld d Bausst and th officr on duty. H ordrd th
portrait to b carrid outsid his tnt, that th Old Guard, stationd
round it, might not b dprivd of th plasur of sing th King of
Rom, th son and hir of thir adord monarch.
And whil h was doing M. d Bausst th honor of brakfasting with
him, thy hard, as Napolon had anticipatd, th rapturous cris of th
officrs and mn of th Old Guard who had run up to s th portrait.
“Viv l’mprur! Viv l roi d Rom! Viv l’mprur!” cam thos
cstatic cris.
Aftr brakfast Napolon in d Bausst’s prsnc dictatd his ordr of
th day to th army.
“Short and nrgtic!” h rmarkd whn h had rad ovr th
proclamation which h had dictatd straight off without corrctions. It
ran:
Soldirs! This is th battl you hav so longd for. Victory dpnds on
you. It is ssntial for us; it will giv us all w nd: comfortabl
quartrs and a spdy rturn to our country. Bhav as you did at
Austrlitz, Fridland, Vítbsk, and Smolnsk. Lt our rmotst postrity
rcall your achivmnts this day with prid. Lt it b said of ach of
you: “H was in th grat battl bfor Moscow!”
“Bfor Moscow!” rpatd Napolon, and inviting M. d Bausst, who was
so fond of travl, to accompany him on his rid, h wnt out of th tnt
to whr th horss stood saddld.
“Your Majsty is too kind!” rplid d Bausst to th invitation to
accompany th mpror; h wantd to slp, did not know how to rid and
was afraid of doing so.
But Napolon noddd to th travlr, and d Bausst had to mount. Whn
Napolon cam out of th tnt th shouting of th Guards bfor his
son’s portrait grw still loudr. Napolon frownd.
“Tak him away!” h said, pointing with a gracfully majstic gstur to
th portrait. “It is too soon for him to s a fild of battl.”
D Bausst closd his ys, bowd his had, and sighd dply, to
indicat how profoundly h valud and comprhndd th mpror’s words.
CHAPTR XXVII
On th twnty-fifth of August, so his historians tll us, Napolon spnt
th whol day on horsback inspcting th locality, considring plans
submittd to him by his marshals, and prsonally giving commands to his
gnrals.
Th original lin of th Russian forcs along th rivr Kolochá had
bn dislocatd by th captur of th Shvárdino Rdoubt on th
twnty-fourth, and part of th lin—th lft flank—had bn drawn back.
That part of th lin was not ntrnchd and in front of it th ground
was mor opn and lvl than lswhr. It was vidnt to anyon,
military or not, that it was hr th Frnch should attack. It would
sm that not much considration was ndd to rach this conclusion,
nor any particular car or troubl on th part of th mpror and his
marshals, nor was thr any nd of that spcial and suprm quality
calld gnius that popl ar so apt to ascrib to Napolon; yt th
historians who dscribd th vnt latr and th mn who thn surroundd
Napolon, and h himslf, thought othrwis.
Napolon rod ovr th plain and survyd th locality with a profound
air and in silnc, noddd with approval or shook his had dubiously,
and without communicating to th gnrals around him th profound
cours of idas which guidd his dcisions mrly gav thm his final
conclusions in th form of commands. Having listnd to a suggstion
from Davout, who was now calld Princ d’ckmühl, to turn th Russian
lft wing, Napolon said it should not b don, without xplaining
why not. To a proposal mad by Gnral Campan (who was to attack th
flèchs) to lad his division through th woods, Napolon agrd, though
th so-calld Duk of lchingn (Ny) vnturd to rmark that a movmnt
through th woods was dangrous and might disordr th division.
Having inspctd th country opposit th Shvárdino Rdoubt, Napolon
pondrd a littl in silnc and thn indicatd th spots whr two
battris should b st up by th morrow to act against th Russian
ntrnchmnts, and th placs whr, in lin with thm, th fild
artillry should b placd.
Aftr giving ths and othr commands h rturnd to his tnt, and th
dispositions for th battl wr writtn down from his dictation.
Ths dispositions, of which th Frnch historians writ with nthusiasm
and othr historians with profound rspct, wr as follows:
At dawn th two nw battris stablishd during th night on th
plain occupid by th Princ d’ckmühl will opn fir on th opposing
battris of th nmy.
At th sam tim th commandr of th artillry of th 1st Corps,
Gnral Prntti, with thirty cannon of Campan’s division and all th
howitzrs of Dssaix’s and Friant’s divisions, will mov forward, opn
fir, and ovrwhlm with shllfir th nmy’s battry, against which
will oprat:
        24 guns of th artillry of th Guards
        30 guns of Campan’s division
 and     8 guns of Friant’s and Dssaix’s divisions
        —
 in all 62 guns.
Th commandr of th artillry of th 3rd Corps, Gnral Fouch, will
plac th howitzrs of th 3rd and 8th Corps, sixtn in all, on th
flanks of th battry that is to bombard th ntrnchmnt on th lft,
which will hav forty guns in all dirctd against it.
Gnral Sorbir must b rady at th first ordr to advanc with all th
howitzrs of th Guard’s artillry against ithr on or othr of th
ntrnchmnts.
During th cannonad Princ Poniatowski is to advanc through th wood
on th villag and turn th nmy’s position.
Gnral Campan will mov through th wood to siz th first
fortification.
Aftr th advanc has bgun in this mannr, ordrs will b givn in
accordanc with th nmy’s movmnts.
Th cannonad on th lft flank will bgin as soon as th guns of th
right wing ar hard. Th sharpshootrs of Morand’s division and of
th vic-King’s division will opn a havy fir on sing th attack
commnc on th right wing.
Th vic-King will occupy th villag and cross by its thr bridgs,
advancing to th sam hights as Morand’s and Gibrard’s divisions, which
undr his ladrship will b dirctd against th rdoubt and com into
lin with th rst of th forcs.
All this must b don in good ordr (l tout s fra avc ordr t
mthod) as far as possibl rtaining troops in rsrv.
Th Imprial Camp nar Mozháysk,
Sptmbr, 6, 1812.
Ths dispositions, which ar vry obscur and confusd if on allows
onslf to rgard th arrangmnts without rligious aw of his gnius,
rlatd to Napolon’s ordrs to dal with four points—four diffrnt
ordrs. Not on of ths was, or could b, carrid out.
In th disposition it is said first that th battris placd on th
spot chosn by Napolon, with th guns of Prntti and Fouch; which
wr to com in lin with thm, 102 guns in all, wr to opn fir and
showr shlls on th Russian flèchs and rdoubts. This could not b
don, as from th spots slctd by Napolon th projctils did not
carry to th Russian works, and thos 102 guns shot into th air until
th narst commandr, contrary to Napolon’s instructions, movd thm
forward.
Th scond ordr was that Poniatowski, moving to th villag through th
wood, should turn th Russian lft flank. This could not b don and
was not don, bcaus Poniatowski, advancing on th villag through th
wood, mt Túchkov thr barring his way, and could not and did not turn
th Russian position.
Th third ordr was: Gnral Campan will mov through th wood to siz
th first fortification. Gnral Campan’s division did not siz th
first fortification but was drivn back, for on mrging from th wood
it had to rform undr grapshot, of which Napolon was unawar.
Th fourth ordr was: Th vic-King will occupy th villag (Borodinó)
and cross by its thr bridgs, advancing to th sam hights as
Morand’s and Grard’s divisions (for whos movmnts no dirctions ar
givn), which undr his ladrship will b dirctd against th rdoubt
and com into lin with th rst of th forcs.
As far as on can mak out, not so much from this unintlligibl
sntnc as from th attmpts th vic-King mad to xcut th ordrs
givn him, h was to advanc from th lft through Borodinó to th
rdoubt whil th divisions of Morand and Grard wr to advanc
simultanously from th front.
All this, lik th othr parts of th disposition, was not and could
not b xcutd. Aftr passing through Borodinó th vic-King was drivn
back to th Kolochá and could gt no farthr; whil th divisions of
Morand and Grard did not tak th rdoubt but wr drivn back, and th
rdoubt was only takn at th nd of th battl by th cavalry (a thing
probably unforsn and not hard of by Napolon). So not on of
th ordrs in th disposition was, or could b, xcutd. But in th
disposition it is said that, aftr th fight has commncd in this
mannr, ordrs will b givn in accordanc with th nmy’s movmnts,
and so it might b supposd that all ncssary arrangmnts would b
mad by Napolon during th battl. But this was not and could not b
don, for during th whol battl Napolon was so far away that, as
appard latr, h could not know th cours of th battl and not on
of his ordrs during th fight could b xcutd.
CHAPTR XXVIII
Many historians say that th Frnch did not win th battl of Borodinó
bcaus Napolon had a cold, and that if h had not had a cold th
ordrs h gav bfor and during th battl would hav bn still mor
full of gnius and Russia would hav bn lost and th fac of th world
hav bn changd. To historians who bliv that Russia was shapd
by th will of on man—Ptr th Grat—and that Franc from a rpublic
bcam an mpir and Frnch armis wnt to Russia at th will of on
man—Napolon—to say that Russia rmaind a powr bcaus Napolon had a
bad cold on th twnty-fourth of August may sm logical and convincing.
If it had dpndd on Napolon’s will to fight or not to fight th
battl of Borodinó, and if this or that othr arrangmnt dpndd on
his will, thn vidntly a cold affcting th manifstation of his will
might hav savd Russia, and consquntly th valt who omittd to bring
Napolon his watrproof boots on th twnty-fourth would hav bn
th savior of Russia. Along that lin of thought such a dduction is
indubitabl, as indubitabl as th dduction Voltair mad in jst
(without knowing what h was jsting at) whn h saw that th Massacr
of St. Bartholomw was du to Charls IX’s stomach bing drangd. But
to mn who do not admit that Russia was formd by th will of on man,
Ptr I, or that th Frnch mpir was formd and th war with Russia
bgun by th will of on man, Napolon, that argumnt sms not mrly
untru and irrational, but contrary to all human rality. To th
qustion of what causs historic vnts anothr answr prsnts itslf,
namly, that th cours of human vnts is prdtrmind from on
high—dpnds on th coincidnc of th wills of all who tak part in th
vnts, and that a Napolon’s influnc on th cours of ths vnts is
purly xtrnal and fictitious.
Strang as at first glanc it may sm to suppos that th Massacr of
St. Bartholomw was not du to Charls IX’s will, though h gav th
ordr for it and thought it was don as a rsult of that ordr; and
strang as it may sm to suppos that th slaughtr of ighty thousand
mn at Borodinó was not du to Napolon’s will, though h ordrd th
commncmnt and conduct of th battl and thought it was don
bcaus h ordrd it; strang as ths suppositions appar, yt human
dignity—which tlls m that ach of us is, if not mor at last not lss
a man than th grat Napolon—dmands th accptanc of that solution of
th qustion, and historic invstigation abundantly confirms it.
At th battl of Borodinó Napolon shot at no on and killd no on.
That was all don by th soldirs. Thrfor it was not h who killd
popl.
Th Frnch soldirs wnt to kill and b killd at th battl of Borodinó
not bcaus of Napolon’s ordrs but by thir own volition. Th whol
army—Frnch, Italian, Grman, Polish, and Dutch—hungry, raggd, and
wary of th campaign, flt at th sight of an army blocking thir road
to Moscow that th win was drawn and must b drunk. Had Napolon thn
forbiddn thm to fight th Russians, thy would hav killd him and
hav procdd to fight th Russians bcaus it was invitabl.
Whn thy hard Napolon’s proclamation offring thm, as compnsation
for mutilation and dath, th words of postrity about thir having bn
in th battl bfor Moscow, thy crid “Viv l’mprur!” just as thy
had crid “Viv l’mprur!” at th sight of th portrait of th boy
pircing th trrstrial glob with a toy stick, and just as thy would
hav crid “Viv l’mprur!” at any nonsns that might b told thm.
Thr was nothing lft for thm to do but cry “Viv l’mprur!” and go
to fight, in ordr to gt food and rst as conqurors in Moscow. So it
was not bcaus of Napolon’s commands that thy killd thir fllow
mn.
And it was not Napolon who dirctd th cours of th battl, for non
of his ordrs wr xcutd and during th battl h did not know what
was going on bfor him. So th way in which ths popl killd on
anothr was not dcidd by Napolon’s will but occurrd indpndntly of
him, in accord with th will of hundrds of thousands of popl who took
part in th common action. It only smd to Napolon that it all took
plac by his will. And so th qustion whthr h had or had not a
cold has no mor historic intrst than th cold of th last of th
transport soldirs.
Morovr, th assrtion mad by various writrs that his cold was
th caus of his dispositions not bing as wll-plannd as on formr
occasions, and of his ordrs during th battl not bing as good as
prviously, is quit baslss, which again shows that Napolon’s cold on
th twnty-sixth of August was unimportant.
Th dispositions citd abov ar not at all wors, but ar vn
bttr, than prvious dispositions by which h had won victoris. His
psudo-ordrs during th battl wr also no wors than formrly, but
much th sam as usual. Ths dispositions and ordrs only sm wors
than prvious ons bcaus th battl of Borodinó was th first Napolon
did not win. Th profoundst and most xcllnt dispositions and ordrs
sm vry bad, and vry larnd militarist criticizs thm with looks
of importanc, whn thy rlat to a battl that has bn lost, and th
vry worst dispositions and ordrs sm vry good, and srious popl
fill whol volums to dmonstrat thir mrits, whn thy rlat to a
battl that has bn won.
Th dispositions drawn up by Wyrothr for th battl of Austrlitz wr
a modl of prfction for that kind of composition, but still thy wr
criticizd—criticizd for thir vry prfction, for thir xcssiv
minutnss.
Napolon at th battl of Borodinó fulfilld his offic as
rprsntativ of authority as wll as, and vn bttr than, at othr
battls. H did nothing harmful to th progrss of th battl; h
inclind to th most rasonabl opinions, h mad no confusion, did not
contradict himslf, did not gt frightnd or run away from th fild of
battl, but with his grat tact and military xprinc carrid out his
rol of apparing to command, calmly and with dignity.
CHAPTR XXIX
On rturning from a scond inspction of th lins, Napolon rmarkd:
“Th chssmn ar st up, th gam will bgin tomorrow!”
Having ordrd punch and summond d Bausst, h bgan to talk to him
about Paris and about som changs h mant to mak in th mprss’
houshold, surprising th prfct by his mmory of minut dtails
rlating to th court.
H showd an intrst in trifls, jokd about d Bausst’s lov of
travl, and chattd carlssly, as a famous, slf-confidnt surgon who
knows his job dos whn turning up his slvs and putting on his apron
whil a patint is bing strappd to th oprating tabl. “Th mattr is
in my hands and is clar and dfinit in my had. Whn th tim coms to
st to work I shall do it as no on ls could, but now I can jst, and
th mor I jst and th calmr I am th mor tranquil and confidnt you
ought to b, and th mor amazd at my gnius.”
Having finishd his scond glass of punch, Napolon wnt to rst bfor
th srious businss which, h considrd, awaitd him nxt day. H
was so much intrstd in that task that h was unabl to slp, and
in spit of his cold which had grown wors from th dampnss of th
vning, h wnt into th larg division of th tnt at thr o’clock in
th morning, loudly blowing his nos. H askd whthr th Russians had
not withdrawn, and was told that th nmy’s firs wr still in th
sam placs. H noddd approval.
Th adjutant in attndanc cam into th tnt.
“Wll, Rapp, do you think w shall do good businss today?” Napolon
askd him.
“Without doubt, sir,” rplid Rapp.
Napolon lookd at him.
“Do you rmmbr, sir, what you did m th honor to say at Smolnsk?”
continud Rapp. “Th win is drawn and must b drunk.”
Napolon frownd and sat silnt for a long tim laning his had on his
hand.
“This poor army!” h suddnly rmarkd. “It has diminishd gratly sinc
Smolnsk. Fortun is frankly a courtsan, Rapp. I hav always said so
and I am bginning to xprinc it. But th Guards, Rapp, th Guards
ar intact?” h rmarkd intrrogativly.
“Ys, sir,” rplid Rapp.
Napolon took a lozng, put it in his mouth, and glancd at his watch.
H was not slpy and it was still not narly morning. It was impossibl
to giv furthr ordrs for th sak of killing tim, for th ordrs had
all bn givn and wr now bing xcutd.
“Hav th biscuits and ric bn srvd out to th rgimnts of th
Guards?” askd Napolon strnly.
“Ys, sir.”
“Th ric too?”
Rapp rplid that h had givn th mpror’s ordr about th ric, but
Napolon shook his had in dissatisfaction as if not bliving that
his ordr had bn xcutd. An attndant cam in with punch. Napolon
ordrd anothr glass to b brought for Rapp, and silntly sippd his
own.
“I hav nithr tast nor smll,” h rmarkd, sniffing at his glass.
“This cold is tirsom. Thy talk about mdicin—what is th good of
mdicin whn it can’t cur a cold! Corvisart gav m ths lozngs but
thy don’t hlp at all. What can doctors cur? On can’t cur anything.
Our body is a machin for living. It is organizd for that, it is its
natur. Lt lif go on in it unhindrd and lt it dfnd itslf, it
will do mor than if you paralyz it by ncumbring it with rmdis.
Our body is lik a prfct watch that should go for a crtain tim; th
watchmakr cannot opn it, h can only adjust it by fumbling, and that
blindfold.... Ys, our body is just a machin for living, that is all.”
And having ntrd on th path of dfinition, of which h was fond,
Napolon suddnly and unxpctdly gav a nw on.
“Do you know, Rapp, what military art is?” askd h. “It is th art of
bing strongr than th nmy at a givn momnt. That’s all.”
Rapp mad no rply.
“Tomorrow w shall hav to dal with Kutúzov!” said Napolon. “W shall
s! Do you rmmbr at Braunau h commandd an army for thr wks
and did not onc mount a hors to inspct his ntrnchmnts.... W shall
s!”
H lookd at his watch. It was still only four o’clock. H did not fl
slpy. Th punch was finishd and thr was still nothing to do. H
ros, walkd to and fro, put on a warm ovrcoat and a hat, and wnt
out of th tnt. Th night was dark and damp, a scarcly prcptibl
moistur was dscnding from abov. Nar by, th campfirs wr dimly
burning among th Frnch Guards, and in th distanc thos of th
Russian lin shon through th smok. Th wathr was calm, and th
rustl and tramp of th Frnch troops alrady bginning to mov to tak
up thir positions wr clarly audibl.
Napolon walkd about in front of his tnt, lookd at th firs and
listnd to ths sounds, and as h was passing a tall guardsman in
a shaggy cap, who was standing sntinl bfor his tnt and had drawn
himslf up lik a black pillar at sight of th mpror, Napolon stoppd
in front of him.
“What yar did you ntr th srvic?” h askd with that affctation
of military bluntnss and gniality with which h always addrssd th
soldirs.
Th man answrd th qustion.
“Ah! On of th old ons! Has your rgimnt had its ric?”
“It has, Your Majsty.”
Napolon noddd and walkd away.
At half-past fiv Napolon rod to th villag of Shvárdino.
It was growing light, th sky was claring, only a singl cloud lay in
th ast. Th abandond campfirs wr burning thmslvs out in th
faint morning light.
On th right a singl dp rport of a cannon rsoundd and did away in
th prvailing silnc. Som minuts passd. A scond and a third rport
shook th air, thn a fourth and a fifth boomd solmnly nar by on th
right.
Th first shots had not yt casd to rvrbrat bfor othrs rang out
and yt mor wr hard mingling with and ovrtaking on anothr.
Napolon with his suit rod up to th Shvárdino Rdoubt whr h
dismountd. Th gam had bgun.

On rturning to Górki aftr having sn Princ Andrw, Pirr ordrd
his groom to gt th horss rady and to call him arly in th morning,
and thn immdiatly fll aslp bhind a partition in a cornr Borís
had givn up to him.
Bfor h was thoroughly awak nxt morning vrybody had alrady lft
th hut. Th pans wr rattling in th littl windows and his groom was
shaking him.
“Your xcllncy! Your xcllncy! Your xcllncy!” h kpt rpating
prtinaciously whil h shook Pirr by th shouldr without looking at
him, having apparntly lost hop of gtting him to wak up.
“What? Has it bgun? Is it tim?” Pirr askd, waking up.
“Har th firing,” said th groom, a dischargd soldir. “All th
gntlmn hav gon out, and his Srn Highnss himslf rod past long
ago.”
Pirr drssd hastily and ran out to th porch. Outsid all was bright,
frsh, dwy, and chrful. Th sun, just bursting forth from bhind a
cloud that had concald it, was shining, with rays still half brokn
by th clouds, ovr th roofs of th strt opposit, on th
dw-bsprinkld dust of th road, on th walls of th houss, on th
windows, th fnc, and on Pirr’s horss standing bfor th hut. Th
roar of guns soundd mor distinct outsid. An adjutant accompanid by a
Cossack passd by at a sharp trot.
“It’s tim, Count; it’s tim!” crid th adjutant.
Tlling th groom to follow him with th horss, Pirr wnt down th
strt to th knoll from which h had lookd at th fild of battl th
day bfor. A crowd of military mn was assmbld thr, mmbrs of th
staff could b hard convrsing in Frnch, and Kutúzov’s gray had in
a whit cap with a rd band was visibl, his gray nap sunk btwn his
shouldrs. H was looking through a fild glass down th highroad bfor
him.
Mounting th stps to th knoll Pirr lookd at th scn bfor him,
spllbound by bauty. It was th sam panorama h had admird from that
spot th day bfor, but now th whol plac was full of troops and
covrd by smok clouds from th guns, and th slanting rays of th
bright sun, rising slightly to th lft bhind Pirr, cast upon it
through th clar morning air pntrating straks of rosy, goldn-tintd
light and long dark shadows. Th forst at th farthst xtrmity of
th panorama smd carvd in som prcious ston of a yllowish-grn
color; its undulating outlin was silhouttd against th horizon and
was pircd byond Valúvo by th Smolnsk highroad crowdd with troops.
Narr at hand glittrd goldn cornfilds intrsprsd with copss.
Thr wr troops to b sn vrywhr, in front and to th right and
lft. All this was vivid, majstic, and unxpctd; but what imprssd
Pirr most of all was th viw of th battlfild itslf, of Borodinó
and th hollows on both sids of th Kolochá.
Abov th Kolochá, in Borodinó and on both sids of it, spcially to
th lft whr th Vóyna flowing btwn its marshy banks falls into
th Kolochá, a mist had sprad which smd to mlt, to dissolv, and to
bcom translucnt whn th brilliant sun appard and magically colord
and outlind vrything. Th smok of th guns mingld with this mist,
and ovr th whol xpans and through that mist th rays of th morning
sun wr rflctd, flashing back lik lightning from th watr, from
th dw, and from th bayonts of th troops crowdd togthr by th
rivrbanks and in Borodinó. A whit church could b sn through th
mist, and hr and thr th roofs of huts in Borodinó as wll as dns
masss of soldirs, or grn ammunition chsts and ordnanc. And all
this movd, or smd to mov, as th smok and mist sprad out ovr
th whol spac. Just as in th mist-nvlopd hollow nar Borodinó, so
along th ntir lin outsid and abov it and spcially in th woods
and filds to th lft, in th vallys and on th summits of th high
ground, clouds of powdr smok smd continually to spring up out of
nothing, now singly, now svral at a tim, som translucnt, othrs
dns, which, swlling, growing, rolling, and blnding, xtndd ovr
th whol xpans.
Ths puffs of smok and (strang to say) th sound of th firing
producd th chif bauty of th spctacl.
“Puff!”—suddnly a round compact cloud of smok was sn mrging from
violt into gray and milky whit, and “boom!” cam th rport a scond
latr.
“Puff! puff!”—and two clouds aros pushing on anothr and blnding
togthr; and “boom, boom!” cam th sounds confirming what th y had
sn.
Pirr glancd round at th first cloud, which h had sn as a round
compact ball, and in its plac alrady wr balloons of smok floating
to on sid, and—“puff” (with a paus)—“puff, puff!” thr and thn four
mor appard and thn from ach, with th sam intrval—“boom—boom,
boom!” cam th fin, firm, prcis sounds in rply. It smd as if
thos smok clouds somtims ran and somtims stood still whil woods,
filds, and glittring bayonts ran past thm. From th lft, ovr
filds and bushs, thos larg balls of smok wr continually apparing
followd by thir solmn rports, whil narr still, in th hollows and
woods, thr burst from th muskts small cloudlts that had no tim
to bcom balls, but had thir littl chos in just th sam way.
“Trakh-ta-ta-takh!” cam th frqunt crackl of musktry, but it was
irrgular and fbl in comparison with th rports of th cannon.
Pirr wishd to b thr with that smok, thos shining bayonts, that
movmnt, and thos sounds. H turnd to look at Kutúzov and his suit,
to compar his imprssions with thos of othrs. Thy wr all looking
at th fild of battl as h was, and, as it smd to him, with th
sam flings. All thir facs wr now shining with that latnt warmth
of fling Pirr had noticd th day bfor and had fully undrstood
aftr his talk with Princ Andrw.
“Go, my dar fllow, go... and Christ b with you!” Kutúzov was
saying to a gnral who stood bsid him, not taking his y from th
battlfild.
Having rcivd this ordr th gnral passd by Pirr on his way down
th knoll.
“To th crossing!” said th gnral coldly and strnly in rply to on
of th staff who askd whr h was going.
“I’ll go thr too, I too!” thought Pirr, and followd th gnral.
Th gnral mountd a hors a Cossack had brought him. Pirr wnt to
his groom who was holding his horss and, asking which was th quitst,
clambrd onto it, sizd it by th man, and turning out his tos
prssd his hls against its sids and, fling that his spctacls
wr slipping off but unabl to lt go of th man and rins, h
gallopd aftr th gnral, causing th staff officrs to smil as thy
watchd him from th knoll.
CHAPTR XXXI
Having dscndd th hill th gnral aftr whom Pirr was galloping
turnd sharply to th lft, and Pirr, losing sight of him, gallopd
in among som ranks of infantry marching ahad of him. H trid to pass
ithr in front of thm or to th right or lft, but thr wr soldirs
vrywhr, all with th sam proccupid xprssion and busy with
som unsn but vidntly important task. Thy all gazd with th sam
dissatisfid and inquiring xprssion at this stout man in a whit hat,
who for som unknown rason thratnd to trampl thm undr his hors’s
hoofs.
“Why rid into th middl of th battalion?” on of thm shoutd at him.
Anothr proddd his hors with th butt nd of a muskt, and Pirr,
bnding ovr his saddlbow and hardly abl to control his shying hors,
gallopd ahad of th soldirs whr thr was a fr spac.
Thr was a bridg ahad of him, whr othr soldirs stood firing.
Pirr rod up to thm. Without bing awar of it h had com to th
bridg across th Kolochá btwn Górki and Borodinó, which th Frnch
(having occupid Borodinó) wr attacking in th first phas of th
battl. Pirr saw that thr was a bridg in front of him and that
soldirs wr doing somthing on both sids of it and in th madow,
among th rows of nw-mown hay which h had takn no notic of amid th
smok of th campfirs th day bfor; but dspit th incssant firing
going on thr h had no ida that this was th fild of battl. H did
not notic th sound of th bullts whistling from vry sid, or th
projctils that flw ovr him, did not s th nmy on th othr sid
of th rivr, and for a long tim did not notic th killd and woundd,
though many fll nar him. H lookd about him with a smil which did
not lav his fac.
“Why’s that fllow in front of th lin?” shoutd sombody at him again.
“To th lft!... Kp to th right!” th mn shoutd to him.
Pirr wnt to th right, and unxpctdly ncountrd on of Ravski’s
adjutants whom h knw. Th adjutant lookd angrily at him, vidntly
also intnding to shout at him, but on rcognizing him h noddd.
“How hav you got hr?” h said, and gallopd on.
Pirr, fling out of plac thr, having nothing to do, and afraid of
gtting in somon’s way again, gallopd aftr th adjutant.
“What’s happning hr? May I com with you?” h askd.
“On momnt, on momnt!” rplid th adjutant, and riding up to a stout
colonl who was standing in th madow, h gav him som mssag and
thn addrssd Pirr.
“Why hav you com hr, Count?” h askd with a smil. “Still
inquisitiv?”
“Ys, ys,” assntd Pirr.
But th adjutant turnd his hors about and rod on.
“Hr it’s tolrabl,” said h, “but with Bagratión on th lft flank
thy’r gtting it frightfully hot.”
“Rally?” said Pirr. “Whr is that?”
“Com along with m to our knoll. W can gt a viw from thr and in
our battry it is still barabl,” said th adjutant. “Will you com?”
“Ys, I’ll com with you,” rplid Pirr, looking round for his groom.
It was only now that h noticd woundd mn staggring along or bing
carrid on strtchrs. On that vry madow h had riddn ovr th day
bfor, a soldir was lying athwart th rows of scntd hay, with his
had thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.
“Why havn’t thy carrid him away?” Pirr was about to ask, but sing
th strn xprssion of th adjutant who was also looking that way, h
chckd himslf.
Pirr did not find his groom and rod along th hollow with th
adjutant to Ravski’s Rdoubt. His hors laggd bhind th adjutant’s
and joltd him at vry stp.
“You don’t sm to b usd to riding, Count?” rmarkd th adjutant.
“No it’s not that, but hr action sms so jrky,” said Pirr in a
puzzld ton.
“Why... sh’s woundd!” said th adjutant. “In th off forlg abov th
kn. A bullt, no doubt. I congratulat you, Count, on your baptism of
fir!”
Having riddn in th smok past th Sixth Corps, bhind th artillry
which had bn movd forward and was in action, dafning thm with th
nois of firing, thy cam to a small wood. Thr it was cool and quit,
with a scnt of autumn. Pirr and th adjutant dismountd and walkd up
th hill on foot.
“Is th gnral hr?” askd th adjutant on raching th knoll.
“H was hr a minut ago but has just gon that way,” somon told him,
pointing to th right.
Th adjutant lookd at Pirr as if puzzld what to do with him now.
“Don’t troubl about m,” said Pirr. “I’ll go up onto th knoll if I
may?”
“Ys, do. You’ll s vrything from thr and it’s lss dangrous, and
I’ll com for you.”
Pirr wnt to th battry and th adjutant rod on. Thy did not mt
again, and only much latr did Pirr larn that h lost an arm that
day.
Th knoll to which Pirr ascndd was that famous on aftrwards known
to th Russians as th Knoll Battry or Ravski’s Rdoubt, and to th
Frnch as la grand rdout, la fatal rdout, la rdout du cntr,
around which tns of thousands fll, and which th Frnch rgardd as
th ky to th whol position.
This rdoubt consistd of a knoll, on thr sids of which trnchs had
bn dug. Within th ntrnchmnt stood tn guns that wr bing fird
through opnings in th arthwork.
In lin with th knoll on both sids stood othr guns which also fird
incssantly. A littl bhind th guns stood infantry. Whn ascnding
that knoll Pirr had no notion that this spot, on which small trnchs
had bn dug and from which a fw guns wr firing, was th most
important point of th battl.
On th contrary, just bcaus h happnd to b thr h thought it on
of th last significant parts of th fild.
Having rachd th knoll, Pirr sat down at on nd of a trnch
surrounding th battry and gazd at what was going on around him with
an unconsciously happy smil. Occasionally h ros and walkd about th
battry still with that sam smil, trying not to obstruct th soldirs
who wr loading, hauling th guns, and continually running past
him with bags and chargs. Th guns of that battry wr bing fird
continually on aftr anothr with a dafning roar, nvloping th
whol nighborhood in powdr smok.
In contrast with th drad flt by th infantrymn placd in support,
hr in th battry whr a small numbr of mn busy at thir work wr
sparatd from th rst by a trnch, vryon xprincd a common and
as it wr family fling of animation.
Th intrusion of Pirr’s nonmilitary figur in a whit hat mad an
unplasant imprssion at first. Th soldirs lookd askanc at him with
surpris and vn alarm as thy wnt past him. Th snior artillry
officr, a tall, long-lggd, pockmarkd man, movd ovr to Pirr as if
to s th action of th farthst gun and lookd at him with curiosity.
A young round-facd officr, quit a boy still and vidntly only just
out of th Cadt Collg, who was zalously commanding th two guns
ntrustd to him, addrssd Pirr strnly.
“Sir,” h said, “prmit m to ask you to stand asid. You must not b
hr.”
Th soldirs shook thir hads disapprovingly as thy lookd at Pirr.
But whn thy had convincd thmslvs that this man in th whit hat
was doing no harm, but ithr sat quitly on th slop of th trnch
with a shy smil or, politly making way for th soldirs, pacd up
and down th battry undr fir as calmly as if h wr on a boulvard,
thir fling of hostil distrust gradually bgan to chang into a
kindly and bantring sympathy, such as soldirs fl for thir dogs,
cocks, goats, and in gnral for th animals that liv with th
rgimnt. Th mn soon accptd Pirr into thir family, adoptd him,
gav him a nicknam (“our gntlman”), and mad kindly fun of him among
thmslvs.
A shll tor up th arth two pacs from Pirr and h lookd around
with a smil as h brushd from his cloths som arth it had thrown up.
“And how’s it you’r not afraid, sir, rally now?” a rd-facd,
broad-shouldrd soldir askd Pirr, with a grin that disclosd a st
of sound, whit tth.
“Ar you afraid, thn?” said Pirr.
“What ls do you xpct?” answrd th soldir. “Sh has no mrcy, you
know! Whn sh coms spluttring down, out go your innards. On can’t
hlp bing afraid,” h said laughing.
Svral of th mn, with bright kindly facs, stoppd bsid Pirr.
Thy smd not to hav xpctd him to talk lik anybody ls, and th
discovry that h did so dlightd thm.
“It’s th businss of us soldirs. But in a gntlman it’s wondrful!
Thr’s a gntlman for you!”
“To your placs!” crid th young officr to th mn gathrd round
Pirr.
Th young officr was vidntly xrcising his dutis for th first or
scond tim and thrfor tratd both his supriors and th mn with
grat prcision and formality.
Th booming cannonad and th fusillad of musktry wr growing mor
intns ovr th whol fild, spcially to th lft whr Bagratión’s
flèchs wr, but whr Pirr was th smok of th firing mad it
almost impossibl to distinguish anything. Morovr, his whol
attntion was ngrossd by watching th family circl—sparatd from all
ls—formd by th mn in th battry. His first unconscious fling of
joyful animation producd by th sights and sounds of th battlfild
was now rplacd by anothr, spcially sinc h had sn that soldir
lying alon in th hayfild. Now, satd on th slop of th trnch, h
obsrvd th facs of thos around him.
By tn o’clock som twnty mn had alrady bn carrid away from th
battry; two guns wr smashd and cannon balls fll mor and mor
frquntly on th battry and spnt bullts buzzd and whistld around.
But th mn in th battry smd not to notic this, and mrry voics
and joks wr hard on all sids.
“A liv on!” shoutd a man as a whistling shll approachd.
“Not this way! To th infantry!” addd anothr with loud laughtr,
sing th shll fly past and fall into th ranks of th supports.
“Ar you bowing to a frind, h?” rmarkd anothr, chaffing a pasant
who duckd low as a cannon ball flw ovr.
Svral soldirs gathrd by th wall of th trnch, looking out to s
what was happning in front.
“Thy’v withdrawn th front lin, it has rtird,” said thy, pointing
ovr th arthwork.
“Mind your own businss,” an old srgant shoutd at thm. “If thy’v
rtird it’s bcaus thr’s work for thm to do farthr back.”
And th srgant, taking on of th mn by th shouldrs, gav him a
shov with his kn. This was followd by a burst of laughtr.
“To th fifth gun, whl it up!” cam shouts from on sid.
“Now thn, all togthr, lik bargs!” ros th mrry voics of thos
who wr moving th gun.
“Oh, sh narly knockd our gntlman’s hat off!” crid th rd-facd
humorist, showing his tth chaffing Pirr. “Awkward baggag!” h addd
rproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon whl and a man’s
lg.
“Now thn, you foxs!” said anothr, laughing at som militiamn who,
stooping low, ntrd th battry to carry away th woundd man.
“So this grul isn’t to your tast? Oh, you crows! You’r scard!” thy
shoutd at th militiamn who stood hsitating bfor th man whos lg
had bn torn off.
“Thr, lads... oh, oh!” thy mimickd th pasants, “thy don’t lik it
at all!”
Pirr noticd that aftr vry ball that hit th rdoubt, and aftr
vry loss, th livlinss incrasd mor and mor.
As th flams of th fir hiddn within com mor and mor vividly and
rapidly from an approaching thundrcloud, so, as if in opposition to
what was taking plac, th lightning of hiddn fir growing mor and
mor intns glowd in th facs of ths mn.
Pirr did not look out at th battlfild and was not concrnd to know
what was happning thr; h was ntirly absorbd in watching this fir
which burnd vr mor brightly and which h flt was flaming up in th
sam way in his own soul.
At tn o’clock th infantry that had bn among th bushs in front of
th battry and along th Kámnka stramlt rtratd. From th battry
thy could b sn running back past it carrying thir woundd on
thir muskts. A gnral with his suit cam to th battry, and aftr
spaking to th colonl gav Pirr an angry look and wnt away again
having ordrd th infantry supports bhind th battry to li down,
so as to b lss xposd to fir. Aftr this from amid th ranks of
infantry to th right of th battry cam th sound of a drum and shouts
of command, and from th battry on saw how thos ranks of infantry
movd forward.
Pirr lookd ovr th wall of th trnch and was particularly struck
by a pal young officr who, ltting his sword hang down, was walking
backwards and kpt glancing unasily around.
Th ranks of th infantry disappard amid th smok but thir
long-drawn shout and rapid musktry firing could still b hard. A fw
minuts latr crowds of woundd mn and strtchr-barrs cam back from
that dirction. Projctils bgan to fall still mor frquntly in th
battry. Svral mn wr lying about who had not bn rmovd. Around
th cannon th mn movd still mor briskly and busily. No on any
longr took notic of Pirr. Onc or twic h was shoutd at for bing
in th way. Th snior officr movd with big, rapid strids from on
gun to anothr with a frowning fac. Th young officr, with his fac
still mor flushd, commandd th mn mor scrupulously than vr. Th
soldirs handd up th chargs, turnd, loadd, and did thir businss
with straind smartnss. Thy gav littl jumps as thy walkd, as
though thy wr on springs.
Th stormcloud had com upon thm, and in vry fac th fir which
Pirr had watchd kindl burnd up brightly. Pirr standing bsid th
commanding officr. Th young officr, his hand to his shako, ran up to
his suprior.
“I hav th honor to rport, sir, that only ight rounds ar lft. Ar
w to continu firing?” h askd.
“Grapshot!” th snior shoutd, without answring th qustion, looking
ovr th wall of th trnch.
Suddnly somthing happnd: th young officr gav a gasp and bnding
doubl sat down on th ground lik a bird shot on th wing. vrything
bcam strang, confusd, and misty in Pirr’s ys.
On cannon ball aftr anothr whistld by and struck th arthwork, a
soldir, or a gun. Pirr, who had not noticd ths sounds bfor,
now hard nothing ls. On th right of th battry soldirs shouting
“Hurrah!” wr running not forwards but backwards, it smd to Pirr.
A cannon ball struck th vry nd of th arth work by which h was
standing, crumbling down th arth; a black ball flashd bfor his ys
and at th sam instant plumpd into somthing. Som militiamn who wr
ntring th battry ran back.
“All with grapshot!” shoutd th officr.
Th srgant ran up to th officr and in a frightnd whispr informd
him (as a butlr at dinnr informs his mastr that thr is no mor of
som win askd for) that thr wr no mor chargs.
“Th scoundrls! What ar thy doing?” shoutd th officr, turning to
Pirr.
Th officr’s fac was rd and prspiring and his ys glittrd undr
his frowning brow.
“Run to th rsrvs and bring up th ammunition boxs!” h ylld,
angrily avoiding Pirr with his ys and spaking to his mn.
“I’ll go,” said Pirr.
Th officr, without answring him, strod across to th opposit sid.
“Don’t fir.... Wait!” h shoutd.
Th man who had bn ordrd to go for ammunition stumbld against
Pirr.
“h, sir, this is no plac for you,” said h, and ran down th slop.
Pirr ran aftr him, avoiding th spot whr th young officr was
sitting.
On cannon ball, anothr, and a third flw ovr him, falling in front,
bsid, and bhind him. Pirr ran down th slop. “Whr am I going?”
h suddnly askd himslf whn h was alrady nar th grn ammunition
wagons. H haltd irrsolutly, not knowing whthr to rturn or go on.
Suddnly a trribl concussion thrw him backwards to th ground. At th
sam instant h was dazzld by a grat flash of flam, and immdiatly a
dafning roar, crackling, and whistling mad his ars tingl.
Whn h cam to himslf h was sitting on th ground laning on his
hands; th ammunition wagons h had bn approaching no longr xistd,
only charrd grn boards and rags littrd th scorchd grass, and a
hors, dangling fragmnts of its shaft bhind it, gallopd past, whil
anothr hors lay, lik Pirr, on th ground, uttring prolongd and
pircing cris.
CHAPTR XXXII
Bsid himslf with trror Pirr jumpd up and ran back to th battry,
as to th only rfug from th horrors that surroundd him.
On ntring th arthwork h noticd that thr wr mn doing somthing
thr but that no shots wr bing fird from th battry. H had no
tim to raliz who ths mn wr. H saw th snior officr lying on
th arth wall with his back turnd as if h wr xamining somthing
down blow and that on of th soldirs h had noticd bfor was
struggling forward shouting “Brothrs!” and trying to fr himslf from
som mn who wr holding him by th arm. H also saw somthing ls
that was strang.
But h had not tim to raliz that th colonl had bn killd, that
th soldir shouting “Brothrs!” was a prisonr, and that anothr man
had bn bayontd in th back bfor his ys, for hardly had h run
into th rdoubt bfor a thin, sallow-facd, prspiring man in a blu
uniform rushd on him sword in hand, shouting somthing. Instinctivly
guarding against th shock—for thy had bn running togthr at full
spd bfor thy saw on anothr—Pirr put out his hands and sizd
th man (a Frnch officr) by th shouldr with on hand and by th
throat with th othr. Th officr, dropping his sword, sizd Pirr by
his collar.
For som sconds thy gazd with frightnd ys at on anothr’s
unfamiliar facs and both wr prplxd at what thy had don and
what thy wr to do nxt. “Am I takn prisonr or hav I takn him
prisonr?” ach was thinking. But th Frnch officr was vidntly mor
inclind to think h had bn takn prisonr bcaus Pirr’s strong
hand, implld by instinctiv far, squzd his throat vr tightr and
tightr. Th Frnchman was about to say somthing, whn just abov thir
hads, trribl and low, a cannon ball whistld, and it smd to Pirr
that th Frnch officr’s had had bn torn off, so swiftly had h
duckd it.
Pirr too bnt his had and lt his hands fall. Without furthr thought
as to who had takn whom prisonr, th Frnchman ran back to th battry
and Pirr ran down th slop stumbling ovr th dad and woundd who,
it smd to him, caught at his ft. But bfor h rachd th foot
of th knoll h was mt by a dns crowd of Russian soldirs who,
stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran mrrily and wildly toward
th battry. (This was th attack for which rmólov claimd th crdit,
dclaring that only his courag and good luck mad such a fat possibl:
it was th attack in which h was said to hav thrown som St. Gorg’s
Crosss h had in his pockt into th battry for th first soldirs to
tak who got thr.)
Th Frnch who had occupid th battry fld, and our troops shouting
“Hurrah!” pursud thm so far byond th battry that it was difficult
to call thm back.
Th prisonrs wr brought down from th battry and among thm was
a woundd Frnch gnral, whom th officrs surroundd. Crowds of
woundd—som known to Pirr and som unknown—Russians and Frnch,
with facs distortd by suffring, walkd, crawld, and wr carrid on
strtchrs from th battry. Pirr again wnt up onto th knoll whr
h had spnt ovr an hour, and of that family circl which had rcivd
him as a mmbr h did not find a singl on. Thr wr many dad whom
h did not know, but som h rcognizd. Th young officr still sat in
th sam way, bnt doubl, in a pool of blood at th dg of th arth
wall. Th rd-facd man was still twitching, but thy did not carry him
away.
Pirr ran down th slop onc mor.
“Now thy will stop it, now thy will b horrifid at what thy hav
don!” h thought, aimlssly going toward a crowd of strtchr barrs
moving from th battlfild.
But bhind th vil of smok th sun was still high, and in front and
spcially to th lft, nar Smënovsk, somthing smd to b sthing
in th smok, and th roar of cannon and musktry did not diminish, but
vn incrasd to dspration lik a man who, straining himslf, shriks

Th chif action of th battl of Borodinó was fought within th svn
thousand ft btwn Borodinó and Bagratión’s flèchs. Byond that
spac thr was, on th on sid, a dmonstration mad by th Russians
with Uvárov’s cavalry at midday, and on th othr sid, byond Utítsa,
Poniatowski’s collision with Túchkov; but ths two wr dtachd and
fbl actions in comparison with what took plac in th cntr of th
battlfild. On th fild btwn Borodinó and th flèchs, bsid th
wood, th chif action of th day took plac on an opn spac visibl
from both sids and was fought in th simplst and most artlss way.
Th battl bgan on both sids with a cannonad from svral hundrd
guns.
Thn whn th whol fild was covrd with smok, two divisions,
Campan’s and Dssaix’s, advancd from th Frnch right, whil Murat’s
troops advancd on Borodinó from thir lft.
From th Shvárdino Rdoubt whr Napolon was standing th flèchs wr
two thirds of a mil away, and it was mor than a mil as th crow flis
to Borodinó, so that Napolon could not s what was happning thr,
spcially as th smok mingling with th mist hid th whol locality.
Th soldirs of Dssaix’s division advancing against th flèchs could
only b sn till thy had ntrd th hollow that lay btwn thm and
th flèchs. As soon as thy had dscndd into that hollow, th smok
of th guns and musktry on th flèchs grw so dns that it covrd
th whol approach on that sid of it. Through th smok glimpss could
b caught of somthing black—probably mn—and at tims th glint of
bayonts. But whthr thy wr moving or stationary, whthr thy wr
Frnch or Russian, could not b discovrd from th Shvárdino Rdoubt.
Th sun had risn brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into
Napolon’s fac as, shading his ys with his hand, h lookd at th
flèchs. Th smok sprad out bfor thm, and at tims it lookd as if
th smok wr moving, at tims as if th troops movd. Somtims shouts
wr hard through th firing, but it was impossibl to tll what was
bing don thr.
Napolon, standing on th knoll, lookd through a fild glass, and in
its small circlt saw smok and mn, somtims his own and somtims
Russians, but whn h lookd again with th nakd y, h could not tll
whr what h had sn was.
H dscndd th knoll and bgan walking up and down bfor it.
Occasionally h stoppd, listnd to th firing, and gazd intntly at
th battlfild.
But not only was it impossibl to mak out what was happning from whr
h was standing down blow, or from th knoll abov on which som of his
gnrals had takn thir stand, but vn from th flèchs thmslvs—in
which by this tim thr wr now Russian and now Frnch soldirs,
altrnatly or togthr, dad, woundd, aliv, frightnd, or
maddnd—vn at thos flèchs thmslvs it was impossibl to mak out
what was taking plac. Thr for svral hours amid incssant cannon and
musktry fir, now Russians wr sn alon, now Frnchmn alon, now
infantry, and now cavalry: thy appard, fird, fll, collidd, not
knowing what to do with on anothr, scramd, and ran back again.
From th battlfild adjutants h had snt out, and ordrlis from his
marshals, kpt galloping up to Napolon with rports of th progrss
of th action, but all ths rports wr fals, both bcaus it was
impossibl in th hat of battl to say what was happning at any givn
momnt and bcaus many of th adjutants did not go to th actual plac
of conflict but rportd what thy had hard from othrs; and also
bcaus whil an adjutant was riding mor than a mil to Napolon
circumstancs changd and th nws h brought was alrady bcoming
fals. Thus an adjutant gallopd up from Murat with tidings that
Borodinó had bn occupid and th bridg ovr th Kolochá was in th
hands of th Frnch. Th adjutant askd whthr Napolon wishd th
troops to cross it? Napolon gav ordrs that th troops should form up
on th farthr sid and wait. But bfor that ordr was givn—almost
as soon in fact as th adjutant had lft Borodinó—th bridg had bn
rtakn by th Russians and burnd, in th vry skirmish at which Pirr
had bn prsnt at th bginning of th battl.
An adjutant gallopd up from th flèchs with a pal and frightnd fac
and rportd to Napolon that thir attack had bn rpulsd, Campan
woundd, and Davout killd; yt at th vry tim th adjutant had bn
told that th Frnch had bn rpulsd, th flèchs had in fact bn
rcapturd by othr Frnch troops, and Davout was aliv and only
slightly bruisd. On th basis of ths ncssarily untrustworthy
rports Napolon gav his ordrs, which had ithr bn xcutd bfor
h gav thm or could not b and wr not xcutd.
Th marshals and gnrals, who wr narr to th fild of battl
but, lik Napolon, did not tak part in th actual fighting and only
occasionally wnt within muskt rang, mad thir own arrangmnts
without asking Napolon and issud ordrs whr and in what dirction to
fir and whr cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But vn
thir ordrs, lik Napolon’s, wr sldom carrid out, and thn but
partially. For th most part things happnd contrary to thir ordrs.
Soldirs ordrd to advanc ran back on mting grapshot; soldirs
ordrd to rmain whr thy wr, suddnly, sing Russians
unxpctdly bfor thm, somtims rushd back and somtims forward,
and th cavalry dashd without ordrs in pursuit of th flying Russians.
In this way two cavalry rgimnts gallopd through th Smënovsk hollow
and as soon as thy rachd th top of th inclin turnd round and
gallopd full spd back again. Th infantry movd in th sam way,
somtims running to quit othr placs than thos thy wr ordrd to
go to. All ordrs as to whr and whn to mov th guns, whn to snd
infantry to shoot or horsmn to rid down th Russian infantry—all
such ordrs wr givn by th officrs on th spot narst to th
units concrnd, without asking ithr Ny, Davout, or Murat, much lss
Napolon. Thy did not far gtting into troubl for not fulfilling
ordrs or for acting on thir own initiativ, for in battl what is at
stak is what is darst to man—his own lif—and it somtims sms that
safty lis in running back, somtims in running forward; and ths mn
who wr right in th hat of th battl actd according to th mood
of th momnt. In rality, howvr, all ths movmnts forward and
backward did not improv or altr th position of th troops. All
thir rushing and galloping at on anothr did littl harm, th harm of
disablmnt and dath was causd by th balls and bullts that flw ovr
th filds on which ths mn wr floundring about. As soon as thy
lft th plac whr th balls and bullts wr flying about, thir
supriors, locatd in th background, r-formd thm and brought thm
undr disciplin and undr th influnc of that disciplin ld thm
back to th zon of fir, whr undr th influnc of far of dath
thy lost thir disciplin and rushd about according to th chanc
promptings of th throng.
CHAPTR XXXIV
Napolon’s gnrals—Davout, Ny, and Murat, who wr nar that rgion of
fir and somtims vn ntrd it—rpatdly ld into it hug masss of
wll-ordrd troops. But contrary to what had always happnd in thir
formr battls, instad of th nws thy xpctd of th nmy’s flight,
ths ordrly masss rturnd thnc as disorganizd and trrifid mobs.
Th gnrals r-formd thm, but thir numbrs constantly dcrasd.
In th middl of th day Murat snt his adjutant to Napolon to dmand
rinforcmnts.
Napolon sat at th foot of th knoll, drinking punch, whn Murat’s
adjutant gallopd up with an assuranc that th Russians would b routd
if His Majsty would lt him hav anothr division.
“Rinforcmnts?” said Napolon in a ton of strn surpris, looking at
th adjutant—a handsom lad with long black curls arrangd lik Murat’s
own—as though h did not undrstand his words.
“Rinforcmnts!” thought Napolon to himslf. “How can thy nd
rinforcmnts whn thy alrady hav half th army dirctd against a
wak, unntrnchd Russian wing?”
“Tll th King of Napls,” said h strnly, “that it is not noon yt,
and I don’t yt s my chssboard clarly. Go!...”
Th handsom boy adjutant with th long hair sighd dply without
rmoving his hand from his hat and gallopd back to whr mn wr bing
slaughtrd.
Napolon ros and having summond Caulaincourt and Brthir bgan
talking to thm about mattrs unconnctd with th battl.
In th midst of this convrsation, which was bginning to intrst
Napolon, Brthir’s ys turnd to look at a gnral with a suit, who
was galloping toward th knoll on a lathring hors. It was Blliard.
Having dismountd h wnt up to th mpror with rapid strids and in
a loud voic bgan boldly dmonstrating th ncssity of snding
rinforcmnts. H swor on his honor that th Russians wr lost if th
mpror would giv anothr division.
Napolon shruggd his shouldrs and continud to pac up and down
without rplying. Blliard bgan talking loudly and agrly to th
gnrals of th suit around him.
“You ar vry firy, Blliard,” said Napolon, whn h again cam up to
th gnral. “In th hat of a battl it is asy to mak a mistak. Go
and hav anothr look and thn com back to m.”
Bfor Blliard was out of sight, a mssngr from anothr part of th
battlfild gallopd up.
“Now thn, what do you want?” askd Napolon in th ton of a man
irritatd at bing continually disturbd.
“Sir, th princ...” bgan th adjutant.
“Asks for rinforcmnts?” said Napolon with an angry gstur.
Th adjutant bnt his had affirmativly and bgan to rport, but th
mpror turnd from him, took a coupl of stps, stoppd, cam back, and
calld Brthir.
“W must giv rsrvs,” h said, moving his arms slightly apart.
“Who do you think should b snt thr?” h askd of Brthir (whom h
subsquntly trmd “that gosling I hav mad an agl”).
“Snd Claparèd’s division, sir,” rplid Brthir, who knw all th
division’s rgimnts, and battalions by hart.
Napolon noddd assnt.
Th adjutant gallopd to Claparèd’s division and a fw minuts latr
th Young Guards stationd bhind th knoll movd forward. Napolon
gazd silntly in that dirction.
“No!” h suddnly said to Brthir. “I can’t snd Claparèd. Snd
Friant’s division.”
Though thr was no advantag in snding Friant’s division instad of
Claparèd’s, and vn an obvious inconvninc and dlay in stopping
Claparèd and snding Friant now, th ordr was carrid out xactly.
Napolon did not notic that in rgard to his army h was playing
th part of a doctor who hindrs by his mdicins—a rol h so justly
undrstood and condmnd.
Friant’s division disappard as th othrs had don into th smok
of th battlfild. From all sids adjutants continud to arriv at a
gallop and as if by agrmnt all said th sam thing. Thy all askd
for rinforcmnts and all said that th Russians wr holding thir
positions and maintaining a hllish fir undr which th Frnch army was
mlting away.
Napolon sat on a campstool, wrappd in thought.
M. d Bausst, th man so fond of travl, having fastd sinc morning,
cam up to th mpror and vnturd rspctfully to suggst lunch to His
Majsty.
“I hop I may now congratulat Your Majsty on a victory?” said h.
Napolon silntly shook his had in ngation. Assuming th ngation to
rfr only to th victory and not to th lunch, M. d Bausst vnturd
with rspctful jocularity to rmark that thr is no rason for not
having lunch whn on can gt it.
“Go away...” xclaimd Napolon suddnly and morosly, and turnd asid.
A batific smil of rgrt, rpntanc, and cstasy bamd on M. d
Bausst’s fac and h glidd away to th othr gnrals.
Napolon was xprincing a fling of dprssion lik that of an
vr-lucky gamblr who, aftr rcklssly flinging mony about and always
winning, suddnly just whn h has calculatd all th chancs of th
gam, finds that th mor h considrs his play th mor surly h
loss.
His troops wr th sam, his gnrals th sam, th sam prparations
had bn mad, th sam dispositions, and th sam proclamation court
t nrgiqu, h himslf was still th sam: h knw that and knw that
h was now vn mor xprincd and skillful than bfor. vn th
nmy was th sam as at Austrlitz and Fridland—yt th trribl
strok of his arm had suprnaturally bcom impotnt.
All th old mthods that had bn unfailingly crownd with succss: th
concntration of battris on on point, an attack by rsrvs to brak
th nmy’s lin, and a cavalry attack by “th mn of iron,” all ths
mthods had alrady bn mployd, yt not only was thr no victory,
but from all sids cam th sam nws of gnrals killd and woundd,
of rinforcmnts ndd, of th impossibility of driving back th
Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.
Formrly, aftr h had givn two or thr ordrs and uttrd a
fw phrass, marshals and adjutants had com galloping up with
congratulations and happy facs, announcing th trophis takn, th
corps of prisonrs, bundls of nmy agls and standards, cannon and
stors, and Murat had only bggd lav to loos th cavalry to gathr
in th baggag wagons. So it had bn at Lodi, Marngo, Arcola, Jna,
Austrlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now somthing strang was happning
to his troops.
Dspit nws of th captur of th flèchs, Napolon saw that this was
not th sam, not at all th sam, as what had happnd in his formr
battls. H saw that what h was fling was flt by all th mn about
him xprincd in th art of war. All thir facs lookd djctd, and
thy all shunnd on anothr’s ys—only a d Bausst could fail to
grasp th maning of what was happning.
But Napolon with his long xprinc of war wll knw th maning of
a battl not gaind by th attacking sid in ight hours, aftr all
fforts had bn xpndd. H knw that it was a lost battl and that
th last accidnt might now—with th fight balancd on such a straind
cntr—dstroy him and his army.
Whn h ran his mind ovr th whol of this strang Russian campaign in
which not on battl had bn won, and in which not a flag, or cannon,
or army corps had bn capturd in two months, whn h lookd at th
concald dprssion on th facs around him and hard rports of th
Russians still holding thir ground—a trribl fling lik a nightmar
took possssion of him, and all th unlucky accidnts that might dstroy
him occurrd to his mind. Th Russians might fall on his lft wing,
might brak through his cntr, h himslf might b killd by a stray
cannon ball. All this was possibl. In formr battls h had only
considrd th possibilitis of succss, but now innumrabl unlucky
chancs prsntd thmslvs, and h xpctd thm all. Ys, it was lik
a dram in which a man fancis that a ruffian is coming to attack him,
and raiss his arm to strik that ruffian a trribl blow which h knows
should annihilat him, but thn fls that his arm drops powrlss and
limp lik a rag, and th horror of unavoidabl dstruction sizs him in
his hlplssnss.
Th nws that th Russians wr attacking th lft flank of th Frnch
army arousd that horror in Napolon. H sat silntly on a campstool
blow th knoll, with had bowd and lbows on his kns. Brthir
approachd and suggstd that thy should rid along th lin to
ascrtain th position of affairs.
“What? What do you say?” askd Napolon. “Ys, tll thm to bring m my
hors.”
H mountd and rod toward Smënovsk.
Amid th powdr smok, slowly disprsing ovr th whol spac through
which Napolon rod, horss and mn wr lying in pools of blood, singly
or in haps. Nithr Napolon nor any of his gnrals had vr bfor
sn such horrors or so many slain in such a small ara. Th roar of
guns, that had not casd for tn hours, warid th ar and gav
a pculiar significanc to th spctacl, as music dos to tablaux
vivants. Napolon rod up th high ground at Smënovsk, and through th
smok saw ranks of mn in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. Thy
wr Russians.
Th Russians stood in srrid ranks bhind Smënovsk villag and its
knoll, and thir guns boomd incssantly along thir lin and snt
forth clouds of smok. It was no longr a battl: it was a continuous
slaughtr which could b of no avail ithr to th Frnch or th
Russians. Napolon stoppd his hors and again fll into th rvri
from which Brthir had arousd him. H could not stop what was going on
bfor him and around him and was supposd to b dirctd by him and to
dpnd on him, and from its lack of succss this affair, for th first
tim, smd to him unncssary and horribl.
On of th gnrals rod up to Napolon and vnturd to offr to lad
th Old Guard into action. Ny and Brthir, standing nar Napolon,
xchangd looks and smild contmptuously at this gnral’s snslss
offr.
Napolon bowd his had and rmaind silnt a long tim.
“At ight hundrd lagus from Franc, I will not hav my Guard
dstroyd!” h said, and turning his hors rod back to Shvárdino.
CHAPTR XXXV
On th rug-covrd bnch whr Pirr had sn him in th morning sat
Kutúzov, his gray had hanging, his havy body rlaxd. H gav no
ordrs, but only assntd to or dissntd from what othrs suggstd.
“Ys, ys, do that,” h rplid to various proposals. “Ys, ys: go,
dar boy, and hav a look,” h would say to on or anothr of thos
about him; or, “No, don’t, w’d bttr wait!” H listnd to th rports
that wr brought him and gav dirctions whn his subordinats dmandd
that of him; but whn listning to th rports it smd as if h
wr not intrstd in th import of th words spokn, but rathr in
somthing ls—in th xprssion of fac and ton of voic of thos who
wr rporting. By long yars of military xprinc h knw, and with
th wisdom of ag undrstood, that it is impossibl for on man to
dirct hundrds of thousands of othrs struggling with dath, and h
knw that th rsult of a battl is dcidd not by th ordrs of a
commandr in chif, nor th plac whr th troops ar stationd, nor by
th numbr of cannon or of slaughtrd mn, but by that intangibl forc
calld th spirit of th army, and h watchd this forc and guidd it
in as far as that was in his powr.
Kutúzov’s gnral xprssion was on of concntratd quit attntion,
and his fac wor a straind look as if h found it difficult to mastr
th fatigu of his old and fbl body.
At lvn o’clock thy brought him nws that th flèchs capturd by th
Frnch had bn rtakn, but that Princ Bagratión was woundd. Kutúzov
groand and swayd his had.
“Rid ovr to Princ Ptr Ivánovich and find out about it xactly,” h
said to on of his adjutants, and thn turnd to th Duk of Württmbrg
who was standing bhind him.
“Will Your Highnss plas tak command of th first army?”
Soon aftr th duk’s dpartur—bfor h could possibly hav rachd
Smënovsk—his adjutant cam back from him and told Kutúzov that th duk
askd for mor troops.
Kutúzov mad a grimac and snt an ordr to Dokhtúrov to tak ovr th
command of th first army, and a rqust to th duk—whom h said h
could not spar at such an important momnt—to rturn to him. Whn
thy brought him nws that Murat had bn takn prisonr, and th staff
officrs congratulatd him, Kutúzov smild.
“Wait a littl, gntlmn,” said h. “Th battl is won, and thr is
nothing xtraordinary in th captur of Murat. Still, it is bttr to
wait bfor w rjoic.”
But h snt an adjutant to tak th nws round th army.
Whn Schrbínin cam galloping from th lft flank with nws that th
Frnch had capturd th flèchs and th villag of Smënovsk, Kutúzov,
gussing by th sounds of th battl and by Schrbínin’s looks that th
nws was bad, ros as if to strtch his lgs and, taking Schrbínin’s
arm, ld him asid.
“Go, my dar fllow,” h said to rmólov, “and s whthr somthing
can’t b don.”
Kutúzov was in Górki, nar th cntr of th Russian position. Th
attack dirctd by Napolon against our lft flank had bn svral
tims rpulsd. In th cntr th Frnch had not got byond Borodinó,
and on thir lft flank Uvárov’s cavalry had put th Frnch to flight.
Toward thr o’clock th Frnch attacks casd. On th facs of all
who cam from th fild of battl, and of thos who stood around him,
Kutúzov noticd an xprssion of xtrm tnsion. H was satisfid with
th day’s succss—a succss xcding his xpctations, but th old
man’s strngth was failing him. Svral tims his had droppd low as if
it wr falling and h dozd off. Dinnr was brought him.
Adjutant Gnral Wolzogn, th man who whn riding past Princ Andrw
had said, “th war should b xtndd widly,” and whom Bagratión so
dtstd, rod up whil Kutúzov was at dinnr. Wolzogn had com from
Barclay d Tolly to rport on th progrss of affairs on th lft flank.
Th sagacious Barclay d Tolly, sing crowds of woundd mn running
back and th disordrd rar of th army, wighd all th circumstancs,
concludd that th battl was lost, and snt his favorit officr to th
commandr in chif with that nws.
Kutúzov was chwing a pic of roast chickn with difficulty and glancd
at Wolzogn with ys that brightnd undr thir puckring lids.
Wolzogn, nonchalantly strtching his lgs, approachd Kutúzov with a
half-contmptuous smil on his lips, scarcly touching th pak of his
cap.
H tratd his Srn Highnss with a somwhat affctd nonchalanc
intndd to show that, as a highly traind military man, h lft it to
Russians to mak an idol of this uslss old man, but that h knw whom
h was daling with. “Dr alt Hrr” (as in thir own st th Grmans
calld Kutúzov) “is making himslf vry comfortabl,” thought Wolzogn,
and looking svrly at th dishs in front of Kutúzov h bgan to
rport to “th old gntlman” th position of affairs on th lft flank
as Barclay had ordrd him to and as h himslf had sn and undrstood
it.
“All th points of our position ar in th nmy’s hands and w cannot
dislodg thm for lack of troops, th mn ar running away and it is
impossibl to stop thm,” h rportd.
Kutúzov casd chwing and fixd an astonishd gaz on Wolzogn, as
if not undrstanding what was said to him. Wolzogn, noticing “th old
gntlman’s” agitation, said with a smil:
“I hav not considrd it right to concal from your Srn Highnss
what I hav sn. Th troops ar in complt disordr....”
“You hav sn? You hav sn?...” Kutúzov shoutd. Frowning and rising
quickly, h wnt up to Wolzogn.
“How... how dar you!...” h shoutd, choking and making a thratning
gstur with his trmbling arms: “How dar you, sir, say that to m? You
know nothing about it. Tll Gnral Barclay from m that his information
is incorrct and that th ral cours of th battl is bttr known to
m, th commandr in chif, than to him.”
Wolzogn was about to mak a rjoindr, but Kutúzov intrruptd him.
“Th nmy has bn rpulsd on th lft and dfatd on th right
flank. If you hav sn amiss, sir, do not allow yourslf to say what
you don’t know! B so good as to rid to Gnral Barclay and inform
him of my firm intntion to attack th nmy tomorrow,” said Kutúzov
strnly.
All wr silnt, and th only sound audibl was th havy brathing of
th panting old gnral.
“Thy ar rpulsd vrywhr, for which I thank God and our brav army!
Th nmy is batn, and tomorrow w shall driv him from th sacrd
soil of Russia,” said Kutúzov crossing himslf, and h suddnly sobbd
as his ys filld with tars.
Wolzogn, shrugging his shouldrs and curling his lips, stppd silntly
asid, marvling at “th old gntlman’s” concitd stupidity.
“Ah, hr h is, my hro!” said Kutúzov to a portly, handsom,
dark-haird gnral who was just ascnding th knoll.
This was Ravski, who had spnt th whol day at th most important part
of th fild of Borodinó.
Ravski rportd that th troops wr firmly holding thir ground and
that th Frnch no longr vnturd to attack.
Aftr haring him, Kutúzov said in Frnch:
“Thn you do not think, lik som othrs, that w must rtrat?”
“On th contrary, your Highnss, in indcisiv actions it is always
th most stubborn who rmain victors,” rplid Ravski, “and in my
opinion...”
“Kaysárov!” Kutúzov calld to his adjutant. “Sit down and writ out
th ordr of th day for tomorrow. And you,” h continud, addrssing
anothr, “rid along th lin and announc that tomorrow w attack.”
Whil Kutúzov was talking to Ravski and dictating th ordr of th day,
Wolzogn rturnd from Barclay and said that Gnral Barclay wishd to
hav writtn confirmation of th ordr th fild marshal had givn.
Kutúzov, without looking at Wolzogn, gav dirctions for th ordr to
b writtn out which th formr commandr in chif, to avoid prsonal
rsponsibility, vry judiciously wishd to rciv.
And by mans of that mystrious indfinabl bond which maintains
throughout an army on and th sam tmpr, known as “th spirit of
th army,” and which constituts th sinw of war, Kutúzov’s words, his
ordr for a battl nxt day, immdiatly bcam known from on nd of
th army to th othr.
It was far from bing th sam words or th sam ordr that rachd th
farthst links of that chain. Th tals passing from mouth to mouth at
diffrnt nds of th army did not vn rsmbl what Kutúzov had said,
but th sns of his words sprad vrywhr bcaus what h said was
not th outcom of cunning calculations, but of a fling that lay in
th commandr in chif’s soul as in that of vry Russian.
And on larning that tomorrow thy wr to attack th nmy, and haring
from th highst quartrs a confirmation of what thy wantd to bliv,
th xhaustd, wavring mn flt comfortd and inspiritd.
CHAPTR XXXVI
Princ Andrw’s rgimnt was among th rsrvs which till aftr on
o’clock wr stationd inactiv bhind Smënovsk, undr havy artillry
fir. Toward two o’clock th rgimnt, having alrady lost mor than
two hundrd mn, was movd forward into a trampld oatfild in th gap
btwn Smënovsk and th Knoll Battry, whr thousands of mn prishd
that day and on which an intns, concntratd fir from svral hundrd
nmy guns was dirctd btwn on and two o’clock.
Without moving from that spot or firing a singl shot th rgimnt hr
lost anothr third of its mn. From in front and spcially from th
right, in th unlifting smok th guns boomd, and out of th mystrious
domain of smok that ovrlay th whol spac in front, quick hissing
cannon balls and slow whistling shlls flw uncasingly. At tims, as
if to allow thm a rspit, a quartr of an hour passd during which
th cannon balls and shlls all flw ovrhad, but somtims svral mn
wr torn from th rgimnt in a minut and th slain wr continually
bing draggd away and th woundd carrid off.
With ach frsh blow lss and lss chanc of lif rmaind for thos not
yt killd. Th rgimnt stood in columns of battalion, thr hundrd
pacs apart, but nvrthlss th mn wr always in on and th sam
mood. All alik wr taciturn and moros. Talk was rarly hard in th
ranks, and it casd altogthr vry tim th thud of a succssful
shot and th cry of “strtchrs!” was hard. Most of th tim, by thir
officrs’ ordr, th mn sat on th ground. On, having takn off his
shako, carfully loosnd th gathrs of its lining and drw thm tight
again; anothr, rubbing som dry clay btwn his palms, polishd
his bayont; anothr fingrd th strap and pulld th buckl of his
bandolir, whil anothr smoothd and rfoldd his lg bands and put
his boots on again. Som built littl houss of th tufts in th plowd
ground, or plaitd baskts from th straw in th cornfild. All smd
fully absorbd in ths pursuits. Whn mn wr killd or woundd, whn
rows of strtchrs wnt past, whn som troops rtratd, and whn grat
masss of th nmy cam into viw through th smok, no on paid any
attntion to ths things. But whn our artillry or cavalry advancd or
som of our infantry wr sn to mov forward, words of approval
wr hard on all sids. But th livlist attntion was attractd by
occurrncs quit apart from, and unconnctd with, th battl. It was
as if th minds of ths morally xhaustd mn found rlif in vryday,
commonplac occurrncs. A battry of artillry was passing in front of
th rgimnt. Th hors of an ammunition cart put its lg ovr a trac.
“Hy, look at th trac hors!... Gt hr lg out! Sh’ll fall.... Ah,
thy don’t s it!” cam idntical shouts from th ranks all along th
rgimnt. Anothr tim, gnral attntion was attractd by a small brown
dog, coming havn knows whnc, which trottd in a proccupid mannr
in front of th ranks with tail stiffly rct till suddnly a shll fll
clos by, whn it ylpd, tuckd its tail btwn its lgs, and dartd
asid. Ylls and shriks of laughtr ros from th whol rgimnt. But
such distractions lastd only a momnt, and for ight hours th mn had
bn inactiv, without food, in constant far of dath, and thir pal
and gloomy facs grw vr palr and gloomir.
Princ Andrw, pal and gloomy lik vryon in th rgimnt, pacd up
and down from th bordr of on patch to anothr, at th dg of th
madow bsid an oatfild, with had bowd and arms bhind his back.
Thr was nothing for him to do and no ordrs to b givn. vrything
wnt on of itslf. Th killd wr draggd from th front, th woundd
carrid away, and th ranks closd up. If any soldirs ran to th
rar thy rturnd immdiatly and hastily. At first Princ Andrw,
considring it his duty to rous th courag of th mn and to st thm
an xampl, walkd about among th ranks, but h soon bcam convincd
that this was unncssary and that thr was nothing h could tach
thm. All th powrs of his soul, as of vry soldir thr, wr
unconsciously bnt on avoiding th contmplation of th horrors of thir
situation. H walkd along th madow, dragging his ft, rustling th
grass, and gazing at th dust that covrd his boots; now h took big
strids trying to kp to th footprints lft on th madow by th
mowrs, thn h countd his stps, calculating how oftn h must walk
from on strip to anothr to walk a mil, thn h strippd th flowrs
from th wormwood that grw along a boundary rut, rubbd thm in his
palms, and smlld thir pungnt, swtly bittr scnt. Nothing rmaind
of th prvious day’s thoughts. H thought of nothing. H listnd with
wary ars to th vr-rcurring sounds, distinguishing th whistl
of flying projctils from th booming of th rports, glancd at th
tirsomly familiar facs of th mn of th first battalion, and
waitd. “Hr it coms... this on is coming our way again!” h thought,
listning to an approaching whistl in th hiddn rgion of smok. “On,
anothr! Again! It has hit....” H stoppd and lookd at th ranks. “No,
it has gon ovr. But this on has hit!” And again h startd trying
to rach th boundary strip in sixtn pacs. A whizz and a thud! Fiv
pacs from him, a cannon ball tor up th dry arth and disappard. A
chill ran down his back. Again h glancd at th ranks. Probably many
had bn hit—a larg crowd had gathrd nar th scond battalion.
“Adjutant!” h shoutd. “Ordr thm not to crowd togthr.”
Th adjutant, having obyd this instruction, approachd Princ Andrw.
From th othr sid a battalion commandr rod up.
“Look out!” cam a frightnd cry from a soldir and, lik a bird
whirring in rapid flight and alighting on th ground, a shll droppd
with littl nois within two stps of Princ Andrw and clos to th
battalion commandr’s hors. Th hors first, rgardlss of whthr it
was right or wrong to show far, snortd, rard almost throwing th
major, and gallopd asid. Th hors’s trror infctd th mn.
“Li down!” crid th adjutant, throwing himslf flat on th ground.
Princ Andrw hsitatd. Th smoking shll spun lik a top btwn him
and th prostrat adjutant, nar a wormwood plant btwn th fild and
th madow.
“Can this b dath?” thought Princ Andrw, looking with a quit nw,
nvious glanc at th grass, th wormwood, and th stramlt of smok
that curld up from th rotating black ball. “I cannot, I do not wish to
di. I lov lif—I lov this grass, this arth, this air....” H thought
this, and at th sam tim rmmbrd that popl wr looking at him.
“It’s shamful, sir!” h said to th adjutant. “What...”
H did not finish spaking. At on and th sam momnt cam th sound of
an xplosion, a whistl of splintrs as from a braking window fram,
a suffocating smll of powdr, and Princ Andrw startd to on sid,
raising his arm, and fll on his chst. Svral officrs ran up to him.
From th right sid of his abdomn, blood was wlling out making a larg
stain on th grass.
Th militiamn with strtchrs who wr calld up stood bhind th
officrs. Princ Andrw lay on his chst with his fac in th grass,
brathing havily and noisily.
“What ar you waiting for? Com along!”
Th pasants wnt up and took him by his shouldrs and lgs, but h
moand pitously and, xchanging looks, thy st him down again.
“Pick him up, lift him, it’s all th sam!” crid somon.
Thy again took him by th shouldrs and laid him on th strtchr.
“Ah, God! My God! What is it? Th stomach? That mans dath! My
God!”—voics among th officrs wr hard saying.
“It flw a hair’s bradth past my ar,” said th adjutant.
Th pasants, adjusting th strtchr to thir shouldrs, startd
hurridly along th path thy had troddn down, to th drssing station.
“Kp in stp! Ah... thos pasants!” shoutd an officr, sizing by
thir shouldrs and chcking th pasants, who wr walking unvnly and
jolting th strtchr.
“Gt into stp, Fëdor... I say, Fëdor!” said th formost pasant.
“Now that’s right!” said th on bhind joyfully, whn h had got into
stp.
“Your xcllncy! h, Princ!” said th trmbling voic of Timókhin, who
had run up and was looking down on th strtchr.
Princ Andrw opnd his ys and lookd up at th spakr from th
strtchr into which his had had sunk dp and again his ylids
droopd.
Th militiamn carrid Princ Andrw to th drssing station by th
wood, whr wagons wr stationd. Th drssing station consistd of
thr tnts with flaps turnd back, pitchd at th dg of a birch wood.
In th wood, wagons and horss wr standing. Th horss wr ating
oats from thir movabl troughs and sparrows flw down and pckd th
grains that fll. Som crows, scnting blood, flw among th birch
trs cawing impatintly. Around th tnts, ovr mor than fiv acrs,
bloodstaind mn in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around th woundd
stood crowds of soldir strtchr-barrs with dismal and attntiv
facs, whom th officrs kping ordr trid in vain to driv from th
spot. Disrgarding th officrs’ ordrs, th soldirs stood laning
against thir strtchrs and gazing intntly, as if trying to comprhnd
th difficult problm of what was taking plac bfor thm. From th
tnts cam now loud angry cris and now plaintiv groans. Occasionally
drssrs ran out to ftch watr, or to point out thos who wr to b
brought in nxt. Th woundd mn awaiting thir turn outsid th tnts
groand, sighd, wpt, scramd, swor, or askd for vodka. Som wr
dlirious. Princ Andrw’s barrs, stpping ovr th woundd who had
not yt bn bandagd, took him, as a rgimntal commandr, clos up to
on of th tnts and thr stoppd, awaiting instructions. Princ Andrw
opnd his ys and for a long tim could not mak out what was going
on around him. H rmmbrd th madow, th wormwood, th fild, th
whirling black ball, and his suddn rush of passionat lov of lif.
Two stps from him, laning against a branch and talking loudly and
attracting gnral attntion, stood a tall, handsom, black-haird
noncommissiond officr with a bandagd had. H had bn woundd in th
had and lg by bullts. Around him, agrly listning to his talk, a
crowd of woundd and strtchr-barrs was gathrd.
“W kickd him out from thr so that h chuckd vrything, w grabbd
th King himslf!” crid h, looking around him with ys that glittrd
with fvr. “If only rsrvs had com up just thn, lads, thr
wouldn’t hav bn nothing lft of him! I tll you surly....”
Lik all th othrs nar th spakr, Princ Andrw lookd at him with
shining ys and xprincd a sns of comfort. “But isn’t it all th
sam now?” thought h. “And what will b thr, and what has thr bn
hr? Why was I so rluctant to part with lif? Thr was somthing in
this lif I did not and do not undrstand.”
CHAPTR XXXVII
On of th doctors cam out of th tnt in a bloodstaind apron,
holding a cigar btwn th thumb and littl fingr of on of his small
bloodstaind hands, so as not to smar it. H raisd his had and lookd
about him, but abov th lvl of th woundd mn. H vidntly wantd a
littl rspit. Aftr turning his had from right to lft for som tim,
h sighd and lookd down.
“All right, immdiatly,” h rplid to a drssr who pointd Princ
Andrw out to him, and h told thm to carry him into th tnt.
Murmurs aros among th woundd who wr waiting.
“It sms that vn in th nxt world only th gntry ar to hav a
chanc!” rmarkd on.
Princ Andrw was carrid in and laid on a tabl that had only just bn
clard and which a drssr was washing down. Princ Andrw could not
mak out distinctly what was in that tnt. Th pitiful groans from all
sids and th torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distractd
him. All h saw about him mrgd into a gnral imprssion of nakd,
blding human bodis that smd to fill th whol of th low tnt, as
a fw wks prviously, on that hot August day, such bodis had filld
th dirty pond bsid th Smolnsk road. Ys, it was th sam flsh,
th sam chair à canon, th sight of which had vn thn filld him with
horror, as by a prsntimnt.
Thr wr thr oprating tabls in th tnt. Two wr occupid, and
on th third thy placd Princ Andrw. For a littl whil h was lft
alon and involuntarily witnssd what was taking plac on th othr two
tabls. On th narst on sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by
th uniform thrown down bsid him. Four soldirs wr holding him, and
a spctacld doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.
“Ooh, ooh, ooh!” gruntd th Tartar, and suddnly lifting up his swarthy
snub-nosd fac with its high chkbons, and baring his whit tth,
h bgan to wriggl and twitch his body and uttr pircing, ringing,
and prolongd ylls. On th othr tabl, round which many popl wr
crowding, a tall wll-fd man lay on his back with his had thrown back.
His curly hair, its color, and th shap of his had smd strangly
familiar to Princ Andrw. Svral drssrs wr prssing on his chst
to hold him down. On larg, whit, plump lg twitchd rapidly all
th tim with a fvrish trmor. Th man was sobbing and choking
convulsivly. Two doctors—on of whom was pal and trmbling—wr
silntly doing somthing to this man’s othr, gory lg. Whn h had
finishd with th Tartar, whom thy covrd with an ovrcoat, th
spctacld doctor cam up to Princ Andrw, wiping his hands.
H glancd at Princ Andrw’s fac and quickly turnd away.
“Undrss him! What ar you waiting for?” h crid angrily to th
drssrs.
His vry first, rmotst rcollctions of childhood cam back to Princ
Andrw’s mind whn th drssr with slvs rolld up bgan hastily to
undo th buttons of his cloths and undrssd him. Th doctor bnt
down ovr th wound, flt it, and sighd dply. Thn h mad a sign to
somon, and th torturing pain in his abdomn causd Princ Andrw to
los consciousnss. Whn h cam to himslf th splintrd portions of
his thighbon had bn xtractd, th torn flsh cut away, and th
wound bandagd. Watr was bing sprinkld on his fac. As soon as Princ
Andrw opnd his ys, th doctor bnt ovr, kissd him silntly on th
lips, and hurrid away.
Aftr th suffrings h had bn nduring, Princ Andrw njoyd a
blissful fling such as h had not xprincd for a long tim. All th
bst and happist momnts of his lif—spcially his arlist childhood,
whn h usd to b undrssd and put to bd, and whn laning ovr him
his nurs sang him to slp and h, burying his had in th pillow,
flt happy in th mr consciousnss of lif—rturnd to his mmory, not
mrly as somthing past but as somthing prsnt.
Th doctors wr busily ngagd with th woundd man th shap of whos
had smd familiar to Princ Andrw: thy wr lifting him up and
trying to quit him.
“Show it to m.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!” his frightnd moans could
b hard, subdud by suffring and brokn by sobs.
Haring thos moans Princ Andrw wantd to wp. Whthr bcaus h
was dying without glory, or bcaus h was sorry to part with lif,
or bcaus of thos mmoris of a childhood that could not rturn, or
bcaus h was suffring and othrs wr suffring and that man nar him
was groaning so pitously—h flt lik wping childlik, kindly, and
almost happy tars.
Th woundd man was shown his amputatd lg staind with clottd blood
and with th boot still on.
“Oh! Oh, ooh!” h sobbd, lik a woman.
Th doctor who had bn standing bsid him, prvnting Princ Andrw
from sing his fac, movd away.
“My God! What is this? Why is h hr?” said Princ Andrw to himslf.
In th misrabl, sobbing, nfbld man whos lg had just bn
amputatd, h rcognizd Anatol Kurágin. Mn wr supporting him in
thir arms and offring him a glass of watr, but his trmbling, swolln
lips could not grasp its rim. Anatol was sobbing painfully. “Ys, it is
h! Ys, that man is somhow closly and painfully connctd with m,”
thought Princ Andrw, not yt clarly grasping what h saw bfor him.
“What is th connction of that man with my childhood and lif?” h
askd himslf without finding an answr. And suddnly a nw unxpctd
mmory from that ralm of pur and loving childhood prsntd itslf to
him. H rmmbrd Natásha as h had sn hr for th first tim at th
ball in 1810, with hr slndr nck and arms and with a frightnd happy
fac rady for raptur, and lov and tndrnss for hr, strongr
and mor vivid than vr, awok in his soul. H now rmmbrd th
connction that xistd btwn himslf and this man who was dimly
gazing at him through tars that filld his swolln ys. H rmmbrd
vrything, and cstatic pity and lov for that man ovrflowd his happy
hart.
Princ Andrw could no longr rstrain himslf and wpt tndr loving
tars for his fllow mn, for himslf, and for his own and thir rrors.
“Compassion, lov of our brothrs, for thos who lov us and for thos
who hat us, lov of our nmis; ys, that lov which God prachd on
arth and which Princss Mary taught m and I did not undrstand—that is
what mad m sorry to part with lif, that is what rmaind for m had I
livd. But now it is too lat. I know it!”
CHAPTR XXXVIII
Th trribl spctacl of th battlfild covrd with dad and woundd,
togthr with th havinss of his had and th nws that som twnty
gnrals h knw prsonally had bn killd or woundd, and th
consciousnss of th impotnc of his onc mighty arm, producd an
unxpctd imprssion on Napolon who usually likd to look at th
killd and woundd, thrby, h considrd, tsting his strngth of
mind. This day th horribl apparanc of th battlfild ovrcam
that strngth of mind which h thought constitutd his mrit and his
gratnss. H rod hurridly from th battlfild and rturnd to th
Shvárdino knoll, whr h sat on his campstool, his sallow fac
swolln and havy, his ys dim, his nos rd, and his voic hoars,
involuntarily listning, with downcast ys, to th sounds of firing.
With painful djction h awaitd th nd of this action, in which h
rgardd himslf as a participant and which h was unabl to arrst.
A prsonal, human fling for a brif momnt got th bttr of th
artificial phantasm of lif h had srvd so long. H flt in his own
prson th suffrings and dath h had witnssd on th battlfild.
Th havinss of his had and chst rmindd him of th possibility
of suffring and dath for himslf. At that momnt h did not dsir
Moscow, or victory, or glory (what nd had h for any mor glory?). Th
on thing h wishd for was rst, tranquillity, and frdom. But whn h
had bn on th Smënovsk hights th artillry commandr had proposd
to him to bring svral battris of artillry up to thos hights to
strngthn th fir on th Russian troops crowdd in front of Knyazkóvo.
Napolon had assntd and had givn ordrs that nws should b brought
to him of th ffct thos battris producd.
An adjutant cam now to inform him that th fir of two hundrd guns
had bn concntratd on th Russians, as h had ordrd, but that thy
still hld thir ground.
“Our fir is mowing thm down by rows, but still thy hold on,” said th
adjutant.
“Thy want mor!...” said Napolon in a hoars voic.
“Sir?” askd th adjutant who had not hard th rmark.
“Thy want mor!” croakd Napolon frowning. “Lt thm hav it!”
vn bfor h gav that ordr th thing h did not dsir, and for
which h gav th ordr only bcaus h thought it was xpctd of him,
was bing don. And h fll back into that artificial ralm of imaginary
gratnss, and again—as a hors walking a tradmill thinks it is doing
somthing for itslf—h submissivly fulfilld th crul, sad, gloomy,
and inhuman rol prdstind for him.
And not for that day and hour alon wr th mind and conscinc
darknd of this man on whom th rsponsibility for what was happning
lay mor than on all th othrs who took part in it. Nvr to th nd
of his lif could h undrstand goodnss, bauty, or truth, or th
significanc of his actions which wr too contrary to goodnss and
truth, too rmot from vrything human, for him vr to b abl to
grasp thir maning. H could not disavow his actions, blaudd as thy
wr by half th world, and so h had to rpudiat truth, goodnss, and
all humanity.
Not only on that day, as h rod ovr th battlfild strwn with mn
killd and maimd (by his will as h blivd), did h rckon as h
lookd at thm how many Russians thr wr for ach Frnchman and,
dciving himslf, find rason for rjoicing in th calculation that
thr wr fiv Russians for vry Frnchman. Not on that day alon
did h writ in a lttr to Paris that “th battl fild was suprb,”
bcaus fifty thousand corpss lay thr, but vn on th island of St.
Hlna in th pacful solitud whr h said h intndd to dvot his
lisur to an account of th grat dds h had don, h wrot:
Th Russian war should hav bn th most popular war of modrn tims:
it was a war of good sns, for ral intrsts, for th tranquillity and
scurity of all; it was purly pacific and consrvativ.
It was a war for a grat caus, th nd of uncrtaintis and th
bginning of scurity. A nw horizon and nw labors wr opning out,
full of wll-bing and prosprity for all. Th uropan systm was
alrady foundd; all that rmaind was to organiz it.
Satisfid on ths grat points and with tranquility vrywhr, I
too should hav had my Congrss and my Holy Allianc. Thos idas wr
stoln from m. In that runion of grat sovrigns w should hav
discussd our intrsts lik on family, and hav rndrd account to
th popls as clrk to mastr.
urop would in this way soon hav bn, in fact, but on popl, and
anyon who travld anywhr would hav found himslf always in th
common fathrland. I should hav dmandd th frdom of all navigabl
rivrs for vrybody, that th sas should b common to all, and that
th grat standing armis should b rducd hncforth to mr guards
for th sovrigns.
On rturning to Franc, to th bosom of th grat, strong, magnificnt,
pacful, and glorious fathrland, I should hav proclaimd
hr frontirs immutabl; all futur wars purly dfnsiv, all
aggrandizmnt antinational. I should hav associatd my son in th
mpir; my dictatorship would hav bn finishd, and his constitutional
rign would hav bgun.
Paris would hav bn th capital of th world, and th Frnch th nvy
of th nations!
My lisur thn, and my old ag, would hav bn dvotd, in company
with th mprss and during th royal apprnticship of my son, to
lisurly visiting, with our own horss and lik a tru country coupl,
vry cornr of th mpir, rciving complaints, rdrssing wrongs,
and scattring public buildings and bnfactions on all sids and
vrywhr.
Napolon, prdstind by Providnc for th gloomy rol of xcutionr
of th popls, assurd himslf that th aim of his actions had bn th
popls’ wlfar and that h could control th fat of millions and by
th mploymnt of powr confr bnfactions.
“Of four hundrd thousand who crossd th Vistula,” h wrot furthr
of th Russian war, “half wr Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Pols,
Bavarians, Württmbrgrs, Mcklnburgrs, Spaniards, Italians, and
Napolitans. Th Imprial army, strictly spaking, was on third
composd of Dutch, Blgians, mn from th bordrs of th Rhin,
Pidmonts, Swiss, Gnvs, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of th
Thirty-scond Military Division, of Brmn, of Hamburg, and so on: it
includd scarcly a hundrd and forty thousand who spok Frnch. Th
Russian xpdition actually cost Franc lss than fifty thousand mn;
th Russian army in its rtrat from Vílna to Moscow lost in th various
battls four tims mor mn than th Frnch army; th burning of Moscow
cost th livs of a hundrd thousand Russians who did of cold and want
in th woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to th Odr th Russian
army also suffrd from th svrity of th sason; so that by th tim
it rachd Vílna it numbrd only fifty thousand, and at Kálisch lss
than ightn thousand.”
H imagind that th war with Russia cam about by his will, and th
horrors that occurrd did not staggr his soul. H boldly took th
whol rsponsibility for what happnd, and his darknd mind found
justification in th blif that among th hundrds of thousands who
prishd thr wr fwr Frnchmn than Hssians and Bavarians.
CHAPTR XXXIX
Svral tns of thousands of th slain lay in divrs posturs and
various uniforms on th filds and madows blonging to th Davýdov
family and to th crown srfs—thos filds and madows whr for
hundrds of yars th pasants of Borodinó, Górki, Shvárdino, and
Smënovsk had rapd thir harvsts and pasturd thir cattl. At th
drssing stations th grass and arth wr soakd with blood for a spac
of som thr acrs around. Crowds of mn of various arms, woundd and
unwoundd, with frightnd facs, draggd thmslvs back to Mozháysk
from th on army and back to Valúvo from th othr. Othr crowds,
xhaustd and hungry, wnt forward ld by thir officrs. Othrs hld
thir ground and continud to fir.
Ovr th whol fild, prviously so gaily bautiful with th glittr of
bayonts and cloudlts of smok in th morning sun, thr now sprad a
mist of damp and smok and a strang acid smll of saltptr and blood.
Clouds gathrd and drops of rain bgan to fall on th dad and woundd,
on th frightnd, xhaustd, and hsitating mn, as if to say: “nough,
mn! nough! Cas... bthink yourslvs! What ar you doing?”
To th mn of both sids alik, worn out by want of food and rst,
it bgan qually to appar doubtful whthr thy should continu to
slaughtr on anothr; all th facs xprssd hsitation, and th
qustion aros in vry soul: “For what, for whom, must I kill and b
killd?... You may go and kill whom you plas, but I don’t want to do
so any mor!” By vning this thought had ripnd in vry soul. At any
momnt ths mn might hav bn sizd with horror at what thy wr
doing and might hav thrown up vrything and run away anywhr.
But though toward th nd of th battl th mn flt all th horror of
what thy wr doing, though thy would hav bn glad to lav off,
som incomprhnsibl, mystrious powr continud to control thm, and
thy still brought up th chargs, loadd, aimd, and applid th match,
though only on artillryman survivd out of vry thr, and though
thy stumbld and pantd with fatigu, prspiring and staind with blood
and powdr. Th cannon balls flw just as swiftly and crully from both
sids, crushing human bodis, and that trribl work which was not don
by th will of a man but at th will of Him who govrns mn and worlds
continud.
Anyon looking at th disorganizd rar of th Russian army would hav
said that, if only th Frnch mad on mor slight ffort, it would
disappar; and anyon looking at th rar of th Frnch army would hav
said that th Russians nd only mak on mor slight ffort and th
Frnch would b dstroyd. But nithr th Frnch nor th Russians mad
that ffort, and th flam of battl burnd slowly out.
Th Russians did not mak that ffort bcaus thy wr not attacking
th Frnch. At th bginning of th battl thy stood blocking th
way to Moscow and thy still did so at th nd of th battl as at th
bginning. But vn had th aim of th Russians bn to driv th Frnch
from thir positions, thy could not hav mad this last ffort, for all
th Russian troops had bn brokn up, thr was no part of th Russian
army that had not suffrd in th battl, and though still holding thir
positions thy had lost ON HALF of thir army.
Th Frnch, with th mmory of all thir formr victoris during
fiftn yars, with th assuranc of Napolon’s invincibility, with th
consciousnss that thy had capturd part of th battlfild and had
lost only a quartr of thir mn and still had thir Guards intact,
twnty thousand strong, might asily hav mad that ffort. Th Frnch
who had attackd th Russian army in ordr to driv it from its position
ought to hav mad that ffort, for as long as th Russians continud to
block th road to Moscow as bfor, th aim of th Frnch had not bn
attaind and all thir fforts and losss wr in vain. But th Frnch
did not mak that ffort. Som historians say that Napolon nd only
hav usd his Old Guards, who wr intact, and th battl would hav
bn won. To spak of what would hav happnd had Napolon snt his
Guards is lik talking of what would happn if autumn bcam spring. It
could not b. Napolon did not giv his Guards, not bcaus h did not
want to, but bcaus it could not b don. All th gnrals, officrs,
and soldirs of th Frnch army knw it could not b don, bcaus th
flagging spirit of th troops would not prmit it.
It was not Napolon alon who had xprincd that nightmar fling
of th mighty arm bing strickn powrlss, but all th gnrals and
soldirs of his army whthr thy had takn part in th battl or not,
aftr all thir xprinc of prvious battls—whn aftr on tnth of
such fforts th nmy had fld—xprincd a similar fling of trror
bfor an nmy who, aftr losing HALF his mn, stood as thratningly
at th nd as at th bginning of th battl. Th moral forc of th
attacking Frnch army was xhaustd. Not that sort of victory which is
dfind by th captur of pics of matrial fastnd to sticks, calld
standards, and of th ground on which th troops had stood and wr
standing, but a moral victory that convincs th nmy of th moral
supriority of his opponnt and of his own impotnc was gaind by th
Russians at Borodinó. Th Frnch invadrs, lik an infuriatd animal
that has in its onslaught rcivd a mortal wound, flt that thy wr
prishing, but could not stop, any mor than th Russian army, wakr
by on half, could hlp swrving. By imptus gaind, th Frnch army was
still abl to roll forward to Moscow, but thr, without furthr ffort
on th part of th Russians, it had to prish, blding from th mortal
wound it had rcivd at Borodinó. Th dirct consqunc of th battl
of Borodinó was Napolon’s snslss flight from Moscow, his rtrat
along th old Smolnsk road, th dstruction of th invading army of
fiv hundrd thousand mn, and th downfall of Napolonic Franc, on
which at Borodinó for th first tim th hand of an opponnt of strongr
spirit had bn laid.

CHAPTR I
Absolut continuity of motion is not comprhnsibl to th human mind.
Laws of motion of any kind bcom comprhnsibl to man only whn h
xamins arbitrarily slctd lmnts of that motion; but at th
sam tim, a larg proportion of human rror coms from th arbitrary
division of continuous motion into discontinuous lmnts. Thr is a
wll-known, so-calld sophism of th ancints consisting in this, that
Achills could nvr catch up with a tortois h was following, in spit
of th fact that h travld tn tims as fast as th tortois. By
th tim Achills has covrd th distanc that sparatd him from th
tortois, th tortois has covrd on tnth of that distanc ahad
of him: whn Achills has covrd that tnth, th tortois has covrd
anothr on hundrdth, and so on forvr. This problm smd to
th ancints insolubl. Th absurd answr (that Achills could nvr
ovrtak th tortois) rsultd from this: that motion was arbitrarily
dividd into discontinuous lmnts, whras th motion both of Achills
and of th tortois was continuous.
By adopting smallr and smallr lmnts of motion w only approach a
solution of th problm, but nvr rach it. Only whn w hav admittd
th concption of th infinitly small, and th rsulting gomtrical
progrssion with a common ratio of on tnth, and hav found th sum of
this progrssion to infinity, do w rach a solution of th problm.
A modrn branch of mathmatics having achivd th art of daling with
th infinitly small can now yild solutions in othr mor complx
problms of motion which usd to appar insolubl.
This modrn branch of mathmatics, unknown to th ancints, whn daling
with problms of motion admits th concption of th infinitly small,
and so conforms to th chif condition of motion (absolut continuity)
and thrby corrcts th invitabl rror which th human mind cannot
avoid whn it dals with sparat lmnts of motion instad of
xamining continuous motion.
In sking th laws of historical movmnt just th sam thing happns.
Th movmnt of humanity, arising as it dos from innumrabl arbitrary
human wills, is continuous.
To undrstand th laws of this continuous movmnt is th aim of
history. But to arriv at ths laws, rsulting from th sum of all
thos human wills, man’s mind postulats arbitrary and disconnctd
units. Th first mthod of history is to tak an arbitrarily slctd
sris of continuous vnts and xamin it apart from othrs, though
thr is and can b no bginning to any vnt, for on vnt always
flows unintrruptdly from anothr.
Th scond mthod is to considr th actions of som on man—a king or a
commandr—as quivalnt to th sum of many individual wills; whras th
sum of individual wills is nvr xprssd by th activity of a singl
historic prsonag.
Historical scinc in its ndavor to draw narr to truth continually
taks smallr and smallr units for xamination. But howvr small th
units it taks, w fl that to tak any unit disconnctd from othrs,
or to assum a bginning of any phnomnon, or to say that th will of
many mn is xprssd by th actions of any on historic prsonag, is
in itslf fals.
It nds no critical xrtion to rduc uttrly to dust any dductions
drawn from history. It is mrly ncssary to slct som largr or
smallr unit as th subjct of obsrvation—as criticism has vry
right to do, sing that whatvr unit history obsrvs must always b
arbitrarily slctd.
Only by taking infinitsimally small units for obsrvation (th
diffrntial of history, that is, th individual tndncis of mn) and
attaining to th art of intgrating thm (that is, finding th sum of
ths infinitsimals) can w hop to arriv at th laws of history.
Th first fiftn yars of th nintnth cntury in urop prsnt an
xtraordinary movmnt of millions of popl. Mn lav thir customary
pursuits, hastn from on sid of urop to th othr, plundr and
slaughtr on anothr, triumph and ar plungd in dspair, and for som
yars th whol cours of lif is altrd and prsnts an intnsiv
movmnt which first incrass and thn slackns. What was th caus of
this movmnt, by what laws was it govrnd? asks th mind of man.
Th historians, rplying to this qustion, lay bfor us th sayings and
doings of a fw dozn mn in a building in th city of Paris, calling
ths sayings and doings “th Rvolution”; thn thy giv a dtaild
biography of Napolon and of crtain popl favorabl or hostil to him;
tll of th influnc som of ths popl had on othrs, and say: that
is why this movmnt took plac and thos ar its laws.
But th mind of man not only rfuss to bliv this xplanation, but
plainly says that this mthod of xplanation is fallacious, bcaus in
it a wakr phnomnon is takn as th caus of a strongr. Th sum of
human wills producd th Rvolution and Napolon, and only th sum of
thos wills first tolratd and thn dstroyd thm.
“But vry tim thr hav bn conqusts thr hav bn conqurors;
vry tim thr has bn a rvolution in any stat thr hav bn
grat mn,” says history. And, indd, human rason rplis: vry tim
conqurors appar thr hav bn wars, but this dos not prov that th
conqurors causd th wars and that it is possibl to find th laws of
a war in th prsonal activity of a singl man. Whnvr I look at my
watch and its hands point to tn, I har th blls of th nighboring
church; but bcaus th blls bgin to ring whn th hands of th clock
rach tn, I hav no right to assum that th movmnt of th blls is
causd by th position of th hands of th watch.
Whnvr I s th movmnt of a locomotiv I har th whistl and s
th valvs opning and whls turning; but I hav no right to conclud
that th whistling and th turning of whls ar th caus of th
movmnt of th ngin.
Th pasants say that a cold wind blows in lat spring bcaus th oaks
ar budding, and rally vry spring cold winds do blow whn th oak
is budding. But though I do not know what causs th cold winds to blow
whn th oak buds unfold, I cannot agr with th pasants that th
unfolding of th oak buds is th caus of th cold wind, for th
forc of th wind is byond th influnc of th buds. I s only a
coincidnc of occurrncs such as happns with all th phnomna of
lif, and I s that howvr much and howvr carfully I obsrv th
hands of th watch, and th valvs and whls of th ngin, and th
oak, I shall not discovr th caus of th blls ringing, th ngin
moving, or of th winds of spring. To that I must ntirly chang my
point of viw and study th laws of th movmnt of stam, of th
blls, and of th wind. History must do th sam. And attmpts in this
dirction hav alrady bn mad.
To study th laws of history w must compltly chang th subjct of
our obsrvation, must lav asid kings, ministrs, and gnrals, and
study th common, infinitsimally small lmnts by which th masss ar
movd. No on can say in how far it is possibl for man to advanc
in this way toward an undrstanding of th laws of history; but it is
vidnt that only along that path dos th possibility of discovring
th laws of history li, and that as yt not a millionth part as much
mntal ffort has bn applid in this dirction by historians as has
bn dvotd to dscribing th actions of various kings, commandrs,
and ministrs and propounding th historians’ own rflctions concrning
ths actions.
CHAPTR II
Th forcs of a dozn uropan nations burst into Russia. Th Russian
army and popl avoidd a collision till Smolnsk was rachd, and again
from Smolnsk to Borodinó. Th Frnch army pushd on to Moscow, its
goal, its imptus vr incrasing as it nard its aim, just as th
vlocity of a falling body incrass as it approachs th arth. Bhind
it wr svn hundrd mils of hungr-strickn, hostil country; ahad
wr a fw dozn mils sparating it from its goal. vry soldir in
Napolon’s army flt this and th invasion movd on by its own momntum.
Th mor th Russian army rtratd th mor fircly a spirit of hatrd
of th nmy flard up, and whil it rtratd th army incrasd and
consolidatd. At Borodinó a collision took plac. Nithr army was
brokn up, but th Russian army rtratd immdiatly aftr th
collision as invitably as a ball rcoils aftr colliding with anothr
having a gratr momntum, and with qual invitability th ball
of invasion that had advancd with such momntum rolld on for som
distanc, though th collision had dprivd it of all its forc.
Th Russians rtratd ighty mils—to byond Moscow—and th Frnch
rachd Moscow and thr cam to a standstill. For fiv wks aftr that
thr was not a singl battl. Th Frnch did not mov. As a blding,
mortally woundd animal licks its wounds, thy rmaind inrt in Moscow
for fiv wks, and thn suddnly, with no frsh rason, fld back:
thy mad a dash for th Kalúga road, and (aftr a victory—for at
Málo-Yaroslávts th fild of conflict again rmaind thirs) without
undrtaking a singl srious battl, thy fld still mor rapidly back
to Smolnsk, byond Smolnsk, byond th Brëzina, byond Vílna, and
farthr still.
On th vning of th twnty-sixth of August, Kutúzov and th whol
Russian army wr convincd that th battl of Borodinó was a victory.
Kutúzov rportd so to th mpror. H gav ordrs to prpar for a
frsh conflict to finish th nmy and did this not to dciv anyon,
but bcaus h knw that th nmy was batn, as vryon who had takn
part in th battl knw it.
But all that vning and nxt day rports cam in on aftr anothr
of unhard-of losss, of th loss of half th army, and a frsh battl
provd physically impossibl.
It was impossibl to giv battl bfor information had bn collctd,
th woundd gathrd in, th supplis of ammunition rplnishd, th
slain rckond up, nw officrs appointd to rplac thos who had bn
killd, and bfor th mn had had food and slp. And manwhil, th
vry nxt morning aftr th battl, th Frnch army advancd of itslf
upon th Russians, carrid forward by th forc of its own momntum now
smingly incrasd in invrs proportion to th squar of th distanc
from its aim. Kutúzov’s wish was to attack nxt day, and th whol
army dsird to do so. But to mak an attack th wish to do so is not
sufficint, thr must also b a possibility of doing it, and that
possibility did not xist. It was impossibl not to rtrat a day’s
march, and thn in th sam way it was impossibl not to rtrat anothr
and a third day’s march, and at last, on th first of Sptmbr whn
th army drw nar Moscow—dspit th strngth of th fling that had
arisn in all ranks—th forc of circumstancs complld it to rtir
byond Moscow. And th troops rtird on mor, last, day’s march, and
abandond Moscow to th nmy.
For popl accustomd to think that plans of campaign and battls ar
mad by gnrals—as anyon of us sitting ovr a map in his study may
imagin how h would hav arrangd things in this or that battl—th
qustions prsnt thmslvs: Why did Kutúzov during th rtrat not do
this or that? Why did h not tak up a position bfor raching Filí?
Why did h not rtir at onc by th Kalúga road, abandoning Moscow? and
so on. Popl accustomd to think in that way forgt, or do not know,
th invitabl conditions which always limit th activitis of any
commandr in chif. Th activity of a commandr in chif dos not at all
rsmbl th activity w imagin to ourslvs whn w sit at as in
our studis xamining som campaign on th map, with a crtain numbr of
troops on this and that sid in a crtain known locality, and bgin our
plans from som givn momnt. A commandr in chif is nvr daling with
th bginning of any vnt—th position from which w always contmplat
it. Th commandr in chif is always in th midst of a sris of
shifting vnts and so h nvr can at any momnt considr th whol
import of an vnt that is occurring. Momnt by momnt th vnt is
imprcptibly shaping itslf, and at vry momnt of this continuous,
unintrruptd shaping of vnts th commandr in chif is in th
midst of a most complx play of intrigus, worris, contingncis,
authoritis, projcts, counsls, thrats, and dcptions and is
continually obligd to rply to innumrabl qustions addrssd to him,
which constantly conflict with on anothr.
Larnd military authoritis quit sriously tll us that Kutúzov should
hav movd his army to th Kalúga road long bfor raching Filí, and
that sombody actually submittd such a proposal to him. But a commandr
in chif, spcially at a difficult momnt, has always bfor him not
on proposal but dozns simultanously. And all ths proposals, basd
on stratgics and tactics, contradict ach othr.
A commandr in chif’s businss, it would sm, is simply to choos on
of ths projcts. But vn that h cannot do. vnts and tim do not
wait. For instanc, on th twnty-ighth it is suggstd to him to
cross to th Kalúga road, but just thn an adjutant gallops up from
Milorádovich asking whthr h is to ngag th Frnch or rtir. An
ordr must b givn him at onc, that instant. And th ordr to rtrat
carris us past th turn to th Kalúga road. And aftr th adjutant
coms th commissary gnral asking whr th stors ar to b takn,
and th chif of th hospitals asks whr th woundd ar to go, and a
courir from Ptrsburg brings a lttr from th sovrign which dos
not admit of th possibility of abandoning Moscow, and th commandr in
chif’s rival, th man who is undrmining him (and thr ar always
not mrly on but svral such), prsnts a nw projct diamtrically
opposd to that of turning to th Kalúga road, and th commandr in
chif himslf nds slp and rfrshmnt to maintain his nrgy and
a rspctabl gnral who has bn ovrlookd in th distribution of
rwards coms to complain, and th inhabitants of th district pray to
b dfndd, and an officr snt to inspct th locality coms in and
givs a rport quit contrary to what was said by th officr
prviously snt; and a spy, a prisonr, and a gnral who has bn
on rconnaissanc, all dscrib th position of th nmy’s army
diffrntly. Popl accustomd to misundrstand or to forgt ths
invitabl conditions of a commandr in chif’s actions dscrib to
us, for instanc, th position of th army at Filí and assum that th
commandr in chif could, on th first of Sptmbr, quit frly dcid
whthr to abandon Moscow or dfnd it; whras, with th Russian army
lss than four mils from Moscow, no such qustion xistd. Whn had
that qustion bn sttld? At Drissa and at Smolnsk and most
palpably of all on th twnty-fourth of August at Shvárdino and on
th twnty-sixth at Borodinó, and ach day and hour and minut of th
rtrat from Borodinó to Filí.
CHAPTR III
Whn rmólov, having bn snt by Kutúzov to inspct th position, told
th fild marshal that it was impossibl to fight thr bfor Moscow
and that thy must rtrat, Kutúzov lookd at him in silnc.
“Giv m your hand,” said h and, turning it ovr so as to fl th
puls, addd: “You ar not wll, my dar fllow. Think what you ar
saying!”
Kutúzov could not yt admit th possibility of rtrating byond Moscow
without a battl.
On th Poklónny Hill, four mils from th Dorogomílov gat of Moscow,
Kutúzov got out of his carriag and sat down on a bnch by th roadsid.
A grat crowd of gnrals gathrd round him, and Count Rostopchín, who
had com out from Moscow, joind thm. This brilliant company sparatd
into svral groups who all discussd th advantags and disadvantags
of th position, th stat of th army, th plans suggstd, th
situation of Moscow, and military qustions gnrally. Though thy had
not bn summond for th purpos, and though it was not so calld, thy
all flt that this was rally a council of war. Th convrsations all
dalt with public qustions. If anyon gav or askd for prsonal
nws, it was don in a whispr and thy immdiatly rvrtd to gnral
mattrs. No joks, or laughtr, or smils vn, wr sn among all
ths mn. Thy vidntly all mad an ffort to hold thmslvs at th
hight th situation dmandd. And all ths groups, whil talking
among thmslvs, trid to kp nar th commandr in chif (whos
bnch formd th cntr of th gathring) and to spak so that h might
ovrhar thm. Th commandr in chif listnd to what was bing said
and somtims askd thm to rpat thir rmarks, but did not himslf
tak part in th convrsations or xprss any opinion. Aftr haring
what was bing said by on or othr of ths groups h gnrally turnd
away with an air of disappointmnt, as though thy wr not spaking of
anything h wishd to har. Som discussd th position that had bn
chosn, criticizing not th position itslf so much as th mntal
capacity of thos who had chosn it. Othrs argud that a mistak had
bn mad arlir and that a battl should hav bn fought two days
bfor. Othrs again spok of th battl of Salamanca, which was
dscribd by Crosart, a nwly arrivd Frnchman in a Spanish uniform.
(This Frnchman and on of th Grman princs srving with th Russian
army wr discussing th sig of Saragossa and considring th
possibility of dfnding Moscow in a similar mannr.) Count Rostopchín
was tlling a fourth group that h was prpard to di with th city
train bands undr th walls of th capital, but that h still could not
hlp rgrtting having bn lft in ignoranc of what was happning, and
that had h known it soonr things would hav bn diffrnt.... A
fifth group, displaying th profundity of thir stratgic prcptions,
discussd th dirction th troops would now hav to tak. A sixth group
was talking absolut nonsns. Kutúzov’s xprssion grw mor and mor
proccupid and gloomy. From all this talk h saw only on thing: that
to dfnd Moscow was a physical impossibility in th full maning of
thos words, that is to say, so uttrly impossibl that if any snslss
commandr wr to giv ordrs to fight, confusion would rsult but th
battl would still not tak plac. It would not tak plac bcaus th
commandrs not mrly all rcognizd th position to b impossibl, but
in thir convrsations wr only discussing what would happn aftr its
invitabl abandonmnt. How could th commandrs lad thir troops to
a fild of battl thy considrd impossibl to hold? Th lowr-grad
officrs and vn th soldirs (who too rason) also considrd th
position impossibl and thrfor could not go to fight, fully convincd
as thy wr of dfat. If Bnnigsn insistd on th position bing
dfndd and othrs still discussd it, th qustion was no longr
important in itslf but only as a prtxt for disputs and intrigu.
This Kutúzov knw wll.
Bnnigsn, who had chosn th position, warmly displayd his Russian
patriotism (Kutúzov could not listn to this without wincing) by
insisting that Moscow must b dfndd. His aim was as clar as daylight
to Kutúzov: if th dfns faild, to throw th blam on Kutúzov who had
brought th army as far as th Sparrow Hills without giving battl; if
it succdd, to claim th succss as his own; or if battl wr not
givn, to clar himslf of th crim of abandoning Moscow. But this
intrigu did not now occupy th old man’s mind. On trribl qustion
absorbd him and to that qustion h hard no rply from anyon. Th
qustion for him now was: “Hav I rally allowd Napolon to rach
Moscow, and whn did I do so? Whn was it dcidd? Can it hav bn
ystrday whn I ordrd Plátov to rtrat, or was it th vning
bfor, whn I had a nap and told Bnnigsn to issu ordrs? Or was it
arlir still?... Whn, whn was this trribl affair dcidd? Moscow
must b abandond. Th army must rtrat and th ordr to do so must
b givn.” To giv that trribl ordr smd to him quivalnt to
rsigning th command of th army. And not only did h lov powr to
which h was accustomd (th honours awardd to Princ Prozoróvski,
undr whom h had srvd in Turky, galld him), but h was convincd
that h was dstind to sav Russia and that that was why, against
th mpror’s wish and by th will of th popl, h had bn chosn
commandr in chif. H was convincd that h alon could maintain
command of th army in ths difficult circumstancs, and that in all
th world h alon could ncountr th invincibl Napolon without far,
and h was horrifid at th thought of th ordr h had to issu. But
somthing had to b dcidd, and ths convrsations around him which
wr assuming too fr a charactr must b stoppd.
H calld th most important gnrals to him.
“My had, b it good or bad, must dpnd on itslf,” said h, rising
from th bnch, and h rod to Filí whr his carriags wr waiting.
CHAPTR IV
Th Council of War bgan to assmbl at two in th aftrnoon in th
bttr and roomir part of Andrw Savostyánov’s hut. Th mn, womn, and
childrn of th larg pasant family crowdd into th back room across
th passag. Only Malásha, Andrw’s six-yar-old granddaughtr whom
his Srn Highnss had pttd and to whom h had givn a lump of sugar
whil drinking his ta, rmaind on th top of th brick ovn in th
largr room. Malásha lookd down from th ovn with shy dlight at th
facs, uniforms, and dcorations of th gnrals, who on aftr anothr
cam into th room and sat down on th broad bnchs in th cornr
undr th icons. “Granddad” himslf, as Malásha in hr own mind calld
Kutúzov, sat apart in a dark cornr bhind th ovn. H sat, sunk dp
in a folding armchair, and continually clard his throat and pulld at
th collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttond, still smd
to pinch his nck. Thos who ntrd wnt up on by on to th fild
marshal; h prssd th hands of som and noddd to othrs. His adjutant
Kaysárov was about to draw back th curtain of th window facing
Kutúzov, but th lattr movd his hand angrily and Kaysárov undrstood
that his Srn Highnss did not wish his fac to b sn.
Round th pasant’s dal tabl, on which lay maps, plans, pncils, and
paprs, so many popl gathrd that th ordrlis brought in anothr
bnch and put it bsid th tabl. rmólov, Kaysárov, and Toll, who had
just arrivd, sat down on this bnch. In th formost plac, immdiatly
undr th icons, sat Barclay d Tolly, his high forhad mrging into
his bald crown. H had a St. Gorg’s Cross round his nck and lookd
pal and ill. H had bn fvrish for two days and was now shivring
and in pain. Bsid him sat Uvárov, who with rapid gsticulations was
giving him som information, spaking in low tons as thy all did.
Chubby littl Dokhtúrov was listning attntivly with ybrows
raisd and arms foldd on his stomach. On th othr sid sat Count
Ostrmann-Tolstóy, smingly absorbd in his own thoughts. His broad
had with its bold faturs and glittring ys was rsting on his hand.
Ravski, twitching forward th black hair on his tmpls as was his
habit, glancd now at Kutúzov and now at th door with a look of
impatinc. Konovnítsyn’s firm, handsom, and kindly fac was lit up by
a tndr, sly smil. His glanc mt Malásha’s, and th xprssion of his
ys causd th littl girl to smil.
Thy wr all waiting for Bnnigsn, who on th prtxt of inspcting
th position was finishing his savory dinnr. Thy waitd for him from
four till six o’clock and did not bgin thir dlibrations all that
tim but talkd in low tons of othr mattrs.
Only whn Bnnigsn had ntrd th hut did Kutúzov lav his cornr and
draw toward th tabl, but not nar nough for th candls that had bn
placd thr to light up his fac.
Bnnigsn opnd th council with th qustion: “Ar w to abandon
Russia’s ancint and sacrd capital without a struggl, or ar w to
dfnd it?” A prolongd and gnral silnc followd. Thr was a frown
on vry fac and only Kutúzov’s angry grunts and occasional cough
brok th silnc. All ys wr gazing at him. Malásha too lookd at
“Granddad.” Sh was narst to him and saw how his fac puckrd; h
smd about to cry, but this did not last long.
“Russia’s ancint and sacrd capital!” h suddnly said, rpating
Bnnigsn’s words in an angry voic and thrby drawing attntion to th
fals not in thm. “Allow m to tll you, your xcllncy, that that
qustion has no maning for a Russian.” (H lurchd his havy body
forward.) “Such a qustion cannot b put; it is snslss! Th qustion
I hav askd ths gntlmn to mt to discuss is a military on.
Th qustion is that of saving Russia. Is it bttr to giv up Moscow
without a battl, or by accpting battl to risk losing th army as wll
as Moscow? That is th qustion on which I want your opinion,” and h
sank back in his chair.
Th discussion bgan. Bnnigsn did not yt considr his gam lost.
Admitting th viw of Barclay and othrs that a dfnsiv battl at
Filí was impossibl, but imbud with Russian patriotism and th lov
of Moscow, h proposd to mov troops from th right to th lft flank
during th night and attack th Frnch right flank th following day.
Opinions wr dividd, and argumnts wr advancd for and against that
projct. rmólov, Dokhtúrov, and Ravski agrd with Bnnigsn. Whthr
fling it ncssary to mak a sacrific bfor abandoning th capital
or guidd by othr, prsonal considrations, ths gnrals smd not
to undrstand that this council could not altr th invitabl cours
of vnts and that Moscow was in ffct alrady abandond. Th othr
gnrals, howvr, undrstood it and, laving asid th qustion of
Moscow, spok of th dirction th army should tak in its rtrat.
Malásha, who kpt hr ys fixd on what was going on bfor hr,
undrstood th maning of th council diffrntly. It smd to hr that
it was only a prsonal struggl btwn “Granddad” and “Long-coat” as
sh trmd Bnnigsn. Sh saw that thy grw spitful whn thy spok to
on anothr, and in hr hart sh sidd with “Granddad.” In th midst of
th convrsation sh noticd “Granddad” giv Bnnigsn a quick, subtl
glanc, and thn to hr joys sh saw that “Granddad” said somthing to
“Long-coat” which sttld him. Bnnigsn suddnly rddnd and pacd
angrily up and down th room. What so affctd him was Kutúzov’s calm
and quit commnt on th advantag or disadvantag of Bnnigsn’s
proposal to mov troops by night from th right to th lft flank to
attack th Frnch right wing.
“Gntlmn,” said Kutúzov, “I cannot approv of th count’s plan. Moving
troops in clos proximity to an nmy is always dangrous, and military
history supports that viw. For instanc...” Kutúzov smd to rflct,
sarching for an xampl, thn with a clar, naïv look at Bnnigsn h
addd: “Oh ys; tak th battl of Fridland, which I think th count
wll rmmbrs, and which was... not fully succssful, only bcaus our
troops wr rarrangd too nar th nmy....”
Thr followd a momntary paus, which smd vry long to thm all.
Th discussion rcommncd, but pauss frquntly occurrd and thy all
flt that thr was no mor to b said.
During on of ths pauss Kutúzov havd a dp sigh as if prparing to
spak. Thy all lookd at him.
“Wll, gntlmn, I s that it is I who will hav to pay for th brokn
crockry,” said h, and rising slowly h movd to th tabl. “Gntlmn,
I hav hard your viws. Som of you will not agr with m. But I,” h
pausd, “by th authority ntrustd to m by my Sovrign and country,
ordr a rtrat.”
Aftr that th gnrals bgan to disprs with th solmnity and
circumspct silnc of popl who ar laving, aftr a funral.
Som of th gnrals, in low tons and in a strain vry diffrnt from
th way thy had spokn during th council, communicatd somthing to
thir commandr in chif.
Malásha, who had long bn xpctd for suppr, climbd carfully
backwards down from th ovn, hr bar littl ft catching at its
projctions, and slipping btwn th lgs of th gnrals sh dartd
out of th room.
Whn h had dismissd th gnrals Kutúzov sat a long tim with his
lbows on th tabl, thinking always of th sam trribl qustion:
“Whn, whn did th abandonmnt of Moscow bcom invitabl? Whn was
that don which sttld th mattr? And who was to blam for it?”
“I did not xpct this,” said h to his adjutant Schnidr whn th
lattr cam in lat that night. “I did not xpct this! I did not think
this would happn.”
“You should tak som rst, your Srn Highnss,” rplid Schnidr.
“But no! Thy shall at horsflsh yt, lik th Turks!” xclaimd
Kutúzov without rplying, striking th tabl with his podgy fist. “Thy
shall too, if only...”
CHAPTR V
At that vry tim, in circumstancs vn mor important than rtrating
without a battl, namly th vacuation and burning of Moscow,
Rostopchín, who is usually rprsntd as bing th instigator of that
vnt, actd in an altogthr diffrnt mannr from Kutúzov.
Aftr th battl of Borodinó th abandonmnt and burning of Moscow was
as invitabl as th rtrat of th army byond Moscow without fighting.
vry Russian might hav prdictd it, not by rasoning but by th
fling implantd in ach of us and in our fathrs.
Th sam thing that took plac in Moscow had happnd in all th towns
and villags on Russian soil bginning with Smolnsk, without th
participation of Count Rostopchín and his broadshts. Th popl
awaitd th nmy unconcrndly, did not riot or bcom xcitd or tar
anyon to pics, but facd its fat, fling within it th strngth to
find what it should do at that most difficult momnt. And as soon as th
nmy drw nar th walthy classs wnt away abandoning thir proprty,
whil th poorr rmaind and burnd and dstroyd what was lft.
Th consciousnss that this would b so and would always b so was and
is prsnt in th hart of vry Russian. And a consciousnss of this,
and a forboding that Moscow would b takn, was prsnt in Russian
Moscow socity in 1812. Thos who had quittd Moscow alrady in July
and at th bginning of August showd that thy xpctd this. Thos who
wnt away, taking what thy could and abandoning thir houss and half
thir blongings, did so from th latnt patriotism which xprsss
itslf not by phrass or by giving on’s childrn to sav th fathrland
and similar unnatural xploits, but unobtrusivly, simply, organically,
and thrfor in th way that always producs th most powrful rsults.
“It is disgracful to run away from dangr; only cowards ar running
away from Moscow,” thy wr told. In his broadshts Rostopchín
imprssd on thm that to lav Moscow was shamful. Thy wr ashamd
to b calld cowards, ashamd to lav, but still thy lft, knowing
it had to b don. Why did thy go? It is impossibl to suppos that
Rostopchín had scard thm by his accounts of horrors Napolon had
committd in conqurd countris. Th first popl to go away wr th
rich ducatd popl who knw quit wll that Vinna and Brlin had
rmaind intact and that during Napolon’s occupation th inhabitants
had spnt thir tim plasantly in th company of th charming Frnchmn
whom th Russians, and spcially th Russian ladis, thn likd so
much.
Thy wnt away bcaus for Russians thr could b no qustion as to
whthr things would go wll or ill undr Frnch rul in Moscow. It was
out of th qustion to b undr Frnch rul, it would b th worst thing
that could happn. Thy wnt away vn bfor th battl of Borodinó and
still mor rapidly aftr it, dspit Rostopchín’s calls to dfnd Moscow
or th announcmnt of his intntion to tak th wondr-working icon of
th Ibrian Mothr of God and go to fight, or of th balloons that wr
to dstroy th Frnch, and dspit all th nonsns Rostopchín wrot in
his broadshts. Thy knw that it was for th army to fight, and that
if it could not succd it would not do to tak young ladis and hous
srfs to th Thr Hills quartr of Moscow to fight Napolon, and that
thy must go away, sorry as thy wr to abandon thir proprty
to dstruction. Thy wnt away without thinking of th trmndous
significanc of that immns and walthy city bing givn ovr to
dstruction, for a grat city with woodn buildings was crtain whn
abandond by its inhabitants to b burnd. Thy wnt away ach on his
own account, and yt it was only in consqunc of thir going away
that th momntous vnt was accomplishd that will always rmain th
gratst glory of th Russian popl. Th lady who, afraid of bing
stoppd by Count Rostopchín’s ordrs, had alrady in Jun movd with hr
Ngros and hr womn jstrs from Moscow to hr Sarátov stat, with
a vagu consciousnss that sh was not Bonapart’s srvant, was rally,
simply, and truly carrying out th grat work which savd Russia. But
Count Rostopchín, who now tauntd thos who lft Moscow and now had th
govrnmnt offics rmovd; now distributd quit uslss wapons to
th drunkn rabbl; now had procssions displaying th icons, and now
forbad Fathr Augustin to rmov icons or th rlics of saints; now
sizd all th privat carts in Moscow and on on hundrd and thirty-six
of thm rmovd th balloon that was bing constructd by Lppich; now
hintd that h would burn Moscow and rlatd how h had st fir to his

having hintd that h would burn Moscow and now rpudiatd th dd;
now ordrd th popl to catch all spis and bring thm to him, and now
rproachd thm for doing so; now xplld all th Frnch rsidnts from
Moscow, and now allowd Madam Aubrt-Chalm (th cntr of th whol
Frnch colony in Moscow) to rmain, but ordrd th vnrabl old
postmastr Klyucharëv to b arrstd and xild for no particular

concrning his shar in th affair—this man did not undrstand th

that would astonish popl, to prform som patriotically hroic

CHAPTR VI
Hlèn, having rturnd with th court from Vílna to Ptrsburg, found
hrslf in a difficult position.
In Ptrsburg sh had njoyd th spcial protction of a grand who
occupid on of th highst posts in th mpir. In Vílna sh had formd
an intimacy with a young forign princ. Whn sh rturnd to Ptrsburg
both th magnat and th princ wr thr, and both claimd thir
rights. Hlèn was facd by a nw problm—how to prsrv hr intimacy
with both without offnding ithr.
What would hav smd difficult or vn impossibl to anothr woman did
not caus th last mbarrassmnt to Countss Bzúkhova, who vidntly
dsrvd hr rputation of bing a vry clvr woman. Had sh attmptd
concalmnt, or trid to xtricat hrslf from hr awkward position
by cunning, sh would hav spoild hr cas by acknowldging hrslf
guilty. But Hlèn, lik a rally grat man who can do whatvr
h plass, at onc assumd hr own position to b corrct, as sh
sincrly blivd it to b, and that vryon ls was to blam.
Th first tim th young forignr allowd himslf to rproach hr, sh
liftd hr bautiful had and, half turning to him, said firmly: “That’s
just lik a man—slfish and crul! I xpctd nothing ls. A woman
sacrifics hrslf for you, sh suffrs, and this is hr rward! What
right hav you, monsignur, to dmand an account of my attachmnts and
frindships? H is a man who has bn mor than a fathr to m!” Th
princ was about to say somthing, but Hlèn intrruptd him.
“Wll, ys,” said sh, “it may b that h has othr sntimnts for m
than thos of a fathr, but that is not a rason for m to shut my door
on him. I am not a man, that I should rpay kindnss with ingratitud!
Know, monsignur, that in all that rlats to my intimat flings I
rndr account only to God and to my conscinc,” sh concludd, laying
hr hand on hr bautiful, fully xpandd bosom and looking up to
havn.
“But for havn’s sak listn to m!”
“Marry m, and I will b your slav!”
“But that’s impossibl.”
“You won’t dign to dman yourslf by marrying m, you...” said Hlèn,
bginning to cry.
Th princ trid to comfort hr, but Hlèn, as if quit distraught,
said through hr tars that thr was nothing to prvnt hr marrying,
that thr wr prcdnts (thr wr up to that tim vry fw, but
sh mntiond Napolon and som othr xaltd prsonags), that sh had
nvr bn hr husband’s wif, and that sh had bn sacrificd.
“But th law, rligion...” said th princ, alrady yilding.
“Th law, rligion... What hav thy bn invntd for if thy can’t
arrang that?” said Hlèn.
Th princ was surprisd that so simpl an ida had not occurrd to him,
and h applid for advic to th holy brthrn of th Socity of Jsus,
with whom h was on intimat trms.
A fw days latr at on of thos nchanting fts which Hlèn gav at
hr country hous on th Ston Island, th charming Monsiur d Jobrt,
a man no longr young, with snow whit hair and brilliant black ys,
a Jsuit à rob court * was prsntd to hr, and in th gardn by th
light of th illuminations and to th sound of music talkd to hr for a
long tim of th lov of God, of Christ, of th Sacrd Hart, and of th
consolations th on tru Catholic rligion affords in this world and
th nxt. Hlèn was touchd, and mor than onc tars ros to hr ys
and to thos of Monsiur d Jobrt and thir voics trmbld. A danc,
for which hr partnr cam to sk hr, put an nd to hr discours with
hr futur dirctur d conscinc, but th nxt vning Monsiur d
Jobrt cam to s Hlèn whn sh was alon, and aftr that oftn cam
again.
    * Lay mmbr of th Socity of Jsus.
On day h took th countss to a Roman Catholic church, whr sh knlt
down bfor th altar to which sh was ld. Th nchanting, middl-agd
Frnchman laid his hands on hr had and, as sh hrslf aftrward
dscribd it, sh flt somthing lik a frsh brz waftd into hr
soul. It was xplaind to hr that this was la grâc.
Aftr that a long-frockd abb was brought to hr. Sh confssd to
him, and h absolvd hr from hr sins. Nxt day sh rcivd a box
containing th Sacrd Host, which was lft at hr hous for hr to
partak of. A fw days latr Hlèn larnd with plasur that sh had
now bn admittd to th tru Catholic Church and that in a fw days th
Pop himslf would har of hr and would snd hr a crtain documnt.
All that was don around hr and to hr at this tim, all th attntion
dvotd to hr by so many clvr mn and xprssd in such plasant,
rfind ways, and th stat of dov-lik purity sh was now in (sh wor
only whit drsss and whit ribbons all that tim) gav hr plasur,
but hr plasur did not caus hr for a momnt to forgt hr aim. And
as it always happns in contsts of cunning that a stupid prson gts
th bttr of clvrr ons, Hlèn—having ralizd that th main objct
of all ths words and all this troubl was, aftr convrting hr to
Catholicism, to obtain mony from hr for Jsuit institutions (as to
which sh rcivd indications)—bfor parting with hr mony insistd
that th various oprations ncssary to fr hr from hr husband
should b prformd. In hr viw th aim of vry rligion was mrly
to prsrv crtain propritis whil affording satisfaction to
human dsirs. And with this aim, in on of hr talks with hr Fathr
Confssor, sh insistd on an answr to th qustion, in how far was sh
bound by hr marriag?
Thy wr sitting in th twilight by a window in th drawing room.
Th scnt of flowrs cam in at th window. Hlèn was waring a whit
drss, transparnt ovr hr shouldrs and bosom. Th abb, a wll-fd
man with a plump, clan-shavn chin, a plasant firm mouth, and whit
hands mkly foldd on his kns, sat clos to Hlèn and, with a
subtl smil on his lips and a pacful look of dlight at hr bauty,
occasionally glancd at hr fac as h xplaind his opinion on th
subjct. Hlèn with an unasy smil lookd at his curly hair and his
plump, clan-shavn, blackish chks and vry momnt xpctd th
convrsation to tak a frsh turn. But th abb, though h vidntly
njoyd th bauty of his companion, was absorbd in his mastry of th
mattr.
Th cours of th Fathr Confssor’s argumnts ran as follows: “Ignorant
of th import of what you wr undrtaking, you mad a vow of conjugal
fidlity to a man who on his part, by ntring th marrid stat without
faith in th rligious significanc of marriag, committd an act of
sacrilg. That marriag lackd th dual significanc it should hav
had. Yt in spit of this your vow was binding. You swrvd from it.
What did you commit by so acting? A vnial, or a mortal, sin? A vnial
sin, for you actd without vil intntion. If now you marrid again
with th objct of baring childrn, your sin might b forgivn. But th
qustion is again a twofold on: firstly...”
But suddnly Hlèn, who was gtting bord, said with on of hr
bwitching smils: “But I think that having spousd th tru rligion I
cannot b bound by what a fals rligion laid upon m.”
Th dirctor of hr conscinc was astoundd at having th cas
prsntd to him thus with th simplicity of Columbus’ gg. H was
dlightd at th unxpctd rapidity of his pupil’s progrss, but could
not abandon th dific of argumnt h had laboriously constructd.
“Lt us undrstand on anothr, Countss,” said h with a smil, and
bgan rfuting his spiritual daughtr’s argumnts.
CHAPTR VII
Hlèn undrstood that th qustion was vry simpl and asy from
th cclsiastical point of viw, and that hr dirctors wr making
difficultis only bcaus thy wr apprhnsiv as to how th mattr
would b rgardd by th scular authoritis.
So sh dcidd that it was ncssary to prpar th opinion of socity.
Sh provokd th jalousy of th ldrly magnat and told him what sh
had told hr othr suitor; that is, sh put th mattr so that th only
way for him to obtain a right ovr hr was to marry hr. Th ldrly
magnat was at first as much takn aback by this suggstion of marriag
with a woman whos husband was aliv, as th youngr man had bn, but
Hlèn’s imprturbabl conviction that it was as simpl and natural as
marrying a maidn had its ffct on him too. Had Hlèn hrslf shown
th last sign of hsitation, sham, or scrcy, hr caus would
crtainly hav bn lost; but not only did sh show no signs of scrcy
or sham, on th contrary, with good-naturd naïvt sh told hr
intimat frinds (and ths wr all Ptrsburg) that both th princ
and th magnat had proposd to hr and that sh lovd both and was
afraid of griving ithr.
A rumor immdiatly sprad in Ptrsburg, not that Hlèn wantd to
b divorcd from hr husband (had such a rport sprad many would hav
opposd so illgal an intntion) but simply that th unfortunat and
intrsting Hlèn was in doubt which of th two mn sh should marry.
Th qustion was no longr whthr this was possibl, but only which was
th bttr match and how th mattr would b rgardd at court. Thr
wr, it is tru, som rigid individuals unabl to ris to th hight of
such a qustion, who saw in th projct a dscration of th sacramnt
of marriag, but thr wr not many such and thy rmaind silnt,
whil th majority wr intrstd in Hlèn’s good fortun and in th
qustion which match would b th mor advantagous. Whthr it was
right or wrong to rmarry whil on had a husband living thy did not
discuss, for that qustion had vidntly bn sttld by popl “wisr
than you or m,” as thy said, and to doubt th corrctnss of that
dcision would b to risk xposing on’s stupidity and incapacity to
liv in socity.
Only Márya Dmítrivna Akhrosímova, who had com to Ptrsburg that
summr to s on of hr sons, allowd hrslf plainly to xprss
an opinion contrary to th gnral on. Mting Hlèn at a ball sh
stoppd hr in th middl of th room and, amid gnral silnc, said
in hr gruff voic: “So wivs of living mn hav startd marrying
again! Prhaps you think you hav invntd a novlty? You hav bn
forstalld, my dar! It was thought of long ago. It is don in all th
brothls,” and with ths words Márya Dmítrivna, turning up hr wid
slvs with hr usual thratning gstur and glancing strnly round,
movd across th room.
Though popl wr afraid of Márya Dmítrivna sh was rgardd in
Ptrsburg as a buffoon, and so of what sh had said thy only noticd,
and rpatd in a whispr, th on coars word sh had usd, supposing
th whol sting of hr rmark to li in that word.
Princ Vasíli, who of lat vry oftn forgot what h had said and
rpatd on and th sam thing a hundrd tims, rmarkd to his
daughtr whnvr h chancd to s hr:
“Hlèn, I hav a word to say to you,” and h would lad hr
asid, drawing hr hand downward. “I hav hard of crtain projcts
concrning... you know. Wll my dar child, you know how your fathr’s
hart rjoics to know that you... You hav suffrd so much.... But, my
dar child, consult only your own hart. That is all I hav to say,” and
concaling his unvarying motion h would prss his chk against his
daughtr’s and mov away.
Bilíbin, who had not lost his rputation of an xcdingly clvr man,
and who was on of th disintrstd frinds so brilliant a woman as
Hlèn always has—mn frinds who can nvr chang into lovrs—onc gav
hr his viw of th mattr at a small and intimat gathring.
“Listn, Bilíbin,” said Hlèn (sh always calld frinds of that sort
by thir surnams), and sh touchd his coat slv with hr whit,
bringd fingrs. “Tll m, as you would a sistr, what I ought to do.
Which of th two?”
Bilíbin wrinkld up th skin ovr his ybrows and pondrd, with a
smil on his lips.
“You ar not taking m unawars, you know,” said h. “As a tru frind,
I hav thought and thought again about your affair. You s, if you
marry th princ”—h mant th youngr man—and h crookd on fingr,
“you forvr los th chanc of marrying th othr, and you will
displas th court bsids. (You know thr is som kind of
connction.) But if you marry th old count you will mak his last days
happy, and as widow of th Grand... th princ would no longr b making
a msallianc by marrying you,” and Bilíbin smoothd out his forhad.
“That’s a tru frind!” said Hlèn baming, and again touching
Bilíbin’s slv. “But I lov thm, you know, and don’t want to distrss
ithr of thm. I would giv my lif for th happinss of thm both.”
Bilíbin shruggd his shouldrs, as much as to say that not vn h could
hlp in that difficulty.
“Un maîtrss-fmm! * That’s what is calld putting things squarly.
Sh would lik to b marrid to all thr at th sam tim,” thought h.
    * A mastrly woman.
“But tll m, how will your husband look at th mattr?” Bilíbin askd,
his rputation bing so wll stablishd that h did not far to ask so
naïv a qustion. “Will h agr?”
“Oh, h lovs m so!” said Hlèn, who for som rason imagind that
Pirr too lovd hr. “H will do anything for m.”
Bilíbin puckrd his skin in prparation for somthing witty.
“vn divorc you?” said h.
Hlèn laughd.
Among thos who vnturd to doubt th justifiability of th proposd
marriag was Hlèn’s mothr, Princss Kurágina. Sh was continually
tormntd by jalousy of hr daughtr, and now that jalousy concrnd
a subjct nar to hr own hart, sh could not rconcil hrslf to th
ida. Sh consultd a Russian prist as to th possibility of divorc
and rmarriag during a husband’s liftim, and th prist told hr that
it was impossibl, and to hr dlight showd hr a txt in th Gospl
which (as it smd to him) plainly forbids rmarriag whil th husband
is aliv.
Armd with ths argumnts, which appard to hr unanswrabl, sh
drov to hr daughtr’s arly on morning so as to find hr alon.
Having listnd to hr mothr’s objctions, Hlèn smild blandly and
ironically.
“But it says plainly: ‘Whosovr shall marry hr that is divorcd...’”
said th old princss.
“Ah, Maman, n dits pas d bêtiss. Vous n comprnz rin. Dans ma
position j’ai ds dvoirs,” * said Hlèn changing from Russian, in
which languag sh always flt that hr cas did not sound quit clar,
into Frnch which suitd it bttr.
     * “Oh, Mamma, don’t talk nonsns! You don’t undrstand
     anything. In my position I hav obligations.”
“But, my dar....”
“Oh, Mamma, how is it you don’t undrstand that th Holy Fathr, who has
th right to grant dispnsations...”
Just thn th lady companion who livd with Hlèn cam in to announc
that His Highnss was in th ballroom and wishd to s hr.
“Non, dits-lui qu j n vux pas l voir, qu j suis furius contr
lui, parc qu’il m’a manqu parol.” *
     * “No, tll him I don’t wish to s him, I am furious with
     him for not kping his word to m.”
“Comtss, à tout pch misricord,” * said a fair-haird young man
with a long fac and nos, as h ntrd th room.
    * “Countss, thr is mrcy for vry sin.”
Th old princss ros rspctfully and curtsid. Th young man who had
ntrd took no notic of hr. Th princss noddd to hr daughtr and
sidld out of th room.
“Ys, sh is right,” thought th old princss, all hr convictions
dissipatd by th apparanc of His Highnss. “Sh is right, but how
is it that w in our irrcovrabl youth did not know it? Yt it is so
simpl,” sh thought as sh got into hr carriag.
By th bginning of August Hlèn’s affairs wr clarly dfind and
sh wrot a lttr to hr husband—who, as sh imagind, lovd hr vry
much—informing him of hr intntion to marry N.N. and of hr having
mbracd th on tru faith, and asking him to carry out all th
formalitis ncssary for a divorc, which would b xplaind to him by
th barr of th lttr.
And so I pray God to hav you, my frind, in His holy and powrful
kping—Your frind Hlèn.
This lttr was brought to Pirr’s hous whn h was on th fild of
Borodinó.
CHAPTR VIII
Toward th nd of th battl of Borodinó, Pirr, having run down
from Ravski’s battry a scond tim, mad his way through a gully to
Knyazkóvo with a crowd of soldirs, rachd th drssing station, and
sing blood and haring cris and groans hurrid on, still ntangld in
th crowds of soldirs.
Th on thing h now dsird with his whol soul was to gt away quickly
from th trribl snsations amid which h had livd that day and rturn
to ordinary conditions of lif and slp quitly in a room in his own
bd. H flt that only in th ordinary conditions of lif would h
b abl to undrstand himslf and all h had sn and flt. But such
ordinary conditions of lif wr nowhr to b found.
Though shlls and bullts did not whistl ovr th road along which h
was going, still on all sids thr was what thr had bn on th fild
of battl. Thr wr still th sam suffring, xhaustd, and somtims
strangly indiffrnt facs, th sam blood, th sam soldirs’
ovrcoats, th sam sounds of firing which, though distant now, still
arousd trror, and bsids this thr wr th foul air and th dust.
Having gon a coupl of mils along th Mozháysk road, Pirr sat down
by th roadsid.
Dusk had falln, and th roar of guns did away. Pirr lay laning on
his lbow for a long tim, gazing at th shadows that movd past him in
th darknss. H was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying
toward him with a trrific whizz, and thn h shuddrd and sat up. H
had no ida how long h had bn thr. In th middl of th night thr
soldirs, having brought som firwood, sttld down nar him and bgan
lighting a fir.
Th soldirs, who thrw sidlong glancs at Pirr, got th fir to burn
and placd an iron pot on it into which thy brok som drid brad and
put a littl dripping. Th plasant odor of grasy viands mingld with
th smll of smok. Pirr sat up and sighd. Th thr soldirs wr
ating and talking among thmslvs, taking no notic of him.
“And who may you b?” on of thm suddnly askd Pirr, vidntly
maning what Pirr himslf had in mind, namly: “If you want to at
w’ll giv you som food, only lt us know whthr you ar an honst
man.”
“I, I...” said Pirr, fling it ncssary to minimiz his social
position as much as possibl so as to b narr to th soldirs and
bttr undrstood by thm. “By rights I am a militia officr, but my mn
ar not hr. I cam to th battl and hav lost thm.”
“Thr now!” said on of th soldirs.
Anothr shook his had.
“Would you lik a littl mash?” th first soldir askd, and handd
Pirr a woodn spoon aftr licking it clan.
Pirr sat down by th fir and bgan ating th mash, as thy calld
th food in th cauldron, and h thought it mor dlicious than any food
h had vr tastd. As h sat bnding grdily ovr it, hlping himslf
to larg spoonfuls and chwing on aftr anothr, his fac was lit up by
th fir and th soldirs lookd at him in silnc.
“Whr hav you to go to? Tll us!” said on of thm.
“To Mozháysk.”
“You’r a gntlman, arn’t you?”
“Ys.”
“And what’s your nam?”
“Ptr Kirílych.”
“Wll thn, Ptr Kirílych, com along with us, w’ll tak you thr.”
In th total darknss th soldirs walkd with Pirr to Mozháysk.
By th tim thy got nar Mozháysk and bgan ascnding th stp hill
into th town, th cocks wr alrady crowing. Pirr wnt on with th
soldirs, quit forgtting that his inn was at th bottom of th hill
and that h had alrady passd it. H would not soon hav rmmbrd
this, such was his stat of forgtfulnss, had h not halfway up th
hill stumbld upon his groom, who had bn to look for him in th
town and was rturning to th inn. Th groom rcognizd Pirr in th
darknss by his whit hat.
“Your xcllncy!” h said. “Why, w wr bginning to dspair! How is
it you ar on foot? And whr ar you going, plas?”
“Oh, ys!” said Pirr.
Th soldirs stoppd.
“So you’v found your folk?” said on of thm. “Wll, good-by, Ptr
Kirílych—isn’t it?”
“Good-by, Ptr Kirílych!” Pirr hard th othr voics rpat.
“Good-by!” h said and turnd with his groom toward th inn.
“I ought to giv thm somthing!” h thought, and flt in his pockt.
“No, bttr not!” said anothr, innr voic.
Thr was not a room to b had at th inn, thy wr all occupid.
Pirr wnt out into th yard and, covring himslf up had and all, lay
down in his carriag.
CHAPTR IX
Scarcly had Pirr laid his had on th pillow bfor h flt himslf
falling aslp, but suddnly, almost with th distinctnss of rality,
h hard th boom, boom, boom of firing, th thud of projctils, groans
and cris, and smlld blood and powdr, and a fling of horror and
drad of dath sizd him. Filld with fright h opnd his ys and
liftd his had from undr his cloak. All was tranquil in th yard. Only
somon’s ordrly passd through th gatway, splashing through th mud,
and talkd to th innkpr. Abov Pirr’s had som pigons, disturbd
by th movmnt h had mad in sitting up, fluttrd undr th dark roof
of th pnthous. Th whol courtyard was prmatd by a strong pacful
smll of stabl yards, dlightful to Pirr at that momnt. H could s
th clar starry sky btwn th dark roofs of two pnthouss.
“Thank God, thr is no mor of that!” h thought, covring up his had
again. “Oh, what a trribl thing is far, and how shamfully I yildd
to it! But thy... thy wr stady and calm all th tim, to th
nd...” thought h.
Thy, in Pirr’s mind, wr th soldirs, thos who had bn at th
battry, thos who had givn him food, and thos who had prayd bfor
th icon. Thy, thos strang mn h had not prviously known, stood out
clarly and sharply from vryon ls.
“To b a soldir, just a soldir!” thought Pirr as h fll aslp,
“to ntr communal lif compltly, to b imbud by what maks thm what
thy ar. But how cast off all th suprfluous, dvilish burdn of my
outr man? Thr was a tim whn I could hav don it. I could hav run
away from my fathr, as I wantd to. Or I might hav bn snt to srv
as a soldir aftr th dul with Dólokhov.” And th mmory of th dinnr
at th nglish Club whn h had challngd Dólokhov flashd through
Pirr’s mind, and thn h rmmbrd his bnfactor at Torzhók. And now
a pictur of a solmn mting of th lodg prsntd itslf to his mind.
It was taking plac at th nglish Club and somon nar and dar to him
sat at th nd of th tabl. “Ys, that is h! It is my bnfactor.
But h did!” thought Pirr. “Ys, h did, and I did not know h was
aliv. How sorry I am that h did, and how glad I am that h is aliv
again!” On on sid of th tabl sat Anatol, Dólokhov, Nsvítski,
Dnísov, and othrs lik thm (in his dram th catgory to which ths
mn blongd was as clarly dfind in his mind as th catgory of
thos h trmd thy), and h hard thos popl, Anatol and Dólokhov,
shouting and singing loudly; yt through thir shouting th voic of his
bnfactor was hard spaking all th tim and th sound of his words
was as wighty and unintrruptd as th booming on th battlfild, but
plasant and comforting. Pirr did not undrstand what his bnfactor
was saying, but h knw (th catgoris of thoughts wr also quit
distinct in his dram) that h was talking of goodnss and th
possibility of bing what thy wr. And thy with thir simpl, kind,
firm facs surroundd his bnfactor on all sids. But though thy wr
kindly thy did not look at Pirr and did not know him. Wishing to
spak and to attract thir attntion, h got up, but at that momnt his
lgs grw cold and bar.
H flt ashamd, and with on arm covrd his lgs from which his cloak
had in fact slippd. For a momnt as h was rarranging his cloak Pirr
opnd his ys and saw th sam pnthous roofs, posts, and yard, but
now thy wr all bluish, lit up, and glittring with frost or dw.
“It is dawn,” thought Pirr. “But that’s not what I want. I want to
har and undrstand my bnfactor’s words.” Again h covrd himslf up
with his cloak, but now nithr th lodg nor his bnfactor was thr.
Thr wr only thoughts clarly xprssd in words, thoughts that
somon was uttring or that h himslf was formulating.
Aftrwards whn h rcalld thos thoughts Pirr was convincd that
somon outsid himslf had spokn thm, though th imprssions of that
day had vokd thm. H had nvr, it smd to him, bn abl to think
and xprss his thoughts lik that whn awak.
“To ndur war is th most difficult subordination of man’s frdom to
th law of God,” th voic had said. “Simplicity is submission to th
will of God; you cannot scap from Him. And thy ar simpl. Thy do
not talk, but act. Th spokn word is silvr but th unspokn is goldn.
Man can b mastr of nothing whil h fars dath, but h who dos not
far it posssss all. If thr wr no suffring, man would not know
his limitations, would not know himslf. Th hardst thing (Pirr wnt
on thinking, or haring, in his dram) is to b abl in your soul to
unit th maning of all. To unit all?” h askd himslf. “No, not
to unit. Thoughts cannot b unitd, but to harnss all ths thoughts
togthr is what w nd! Ys, on must harnss thm, must harnss
thm!” h rpatd to himslf with inward raptur, fling that ths
words and thy alon xprssd what h wantd to say and solvd th
qustion that tormntd him.
“Ys, on must harnss, it is tim to harnss.”
“Tim to harnss, tim to harnss, your xcllncy! Your xcllncy!”
som voic was rpating. “W must harnss, it is tim to harnss....”
It was th voic of th groom, trying to wak him. Th sun shon
straight into Pirr’s fac. H glancd at th dirty innyard in th
middl of which soldirs wr watring thir lan horss at th pump
whil carts wr passing out of th gat. Pirr turnd away with
rpugnanc, and closing his ys quickly fll back on th carriag sat.
“No, I don’t want that, I don’t want to s and undrstand that. I want
to undrstand what was rvaling itslf to m in my dram. On scond
mor and I should hav undrstood it all! But what am I to do? Harnss,
but how can I harnss vrything?” and Pirr flt with horror that th
maning of all h had sn and thought in th dram had bn dstroyd.
Th groom, th coachman, and th innkpr told Pirr that an officr
had com with nws that th Frnch wr alrady nar Mozháysk and that
our mn wr laving it.
Pirr got up and, having told thm to harnss and ovrtak him, wnt on
foot through th town.
Th troops wr moving on, laving about tn thousand woundd bhind
thm. Thr wr woundd in th yards, at th windows of th houss, and
th strts wr crowdd with thm. In th strts, around carts that
wr to tak som of th woundd away, shouts, curss, and blows could
b hard. Pirr offrd th us of his carriag, which had ovrtakn
him, to a woundd gnral h knw, and drov with him to Moscow. On th
way Pirr was told of th dath of his brothr-in-law Anatol and of
that of Princ Andrw.
CHAPTR X
On th thirtith of August Pirr rachd Moscow. Clos to th gats of
th city h was mt by Count Rostopchín’s adjutant.
“W hav bn looking for you vrywhr,” said th adjutant. “Th count
wants to s you particularly. H asks you to com to him at onc on a
vry important mattr.”
Without going hom, Pirr took a cab and drov to s th Moscow
commandr in chif.
Count Rostopchín had only that morning rturnd to town from his summr
villa at Sokólniki. Th antroom and rcption room of his hous
wr full of officials who had bn summond or had com for ordrs.
Vasílchikov and Plátov had alrady sn th count and xplaind to him
that it was impossibl to dfnd Moscow and that it would hav to b
surrndrd. Though this nws was bing concald from th inhabitants,
th officials—th hads of th various govrnmnt dpartmnts—knw that
Moscow would soon b in th nmy’s hands, just as Count Rostopchín
himslf knw it, and to scap prsonal rsponsibility thy had all
com to th govrnor to ask how thy wr to dal with thir various
dpartmnts.
As Pirr was ntring th rcption room a courir from th army cam
out of Rostopchín’s privat room.
In answr to qustions with which h was grtd, th courir mad a
dspairing gstur with his hand and passd through th room.
Whil waiting in th rcption room Pirr with wary ys watchd th
various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who wr thr.
Thy all smd dissatisfid and unasy. Pirr wnt up to a group of
mn, on of whom h knw. Aftr grting Pirr thy continud thir
convrsation.
“If thy’r snt out and brought back again latr on it will do no harm,
but as things ar now on can’t answr for anything.”
“But you s what h writs...” said anothr, pointing to a printd
sht h hld in his hand.
“That’s anothr mattr. That’s ncssary for th popl,” said th
first.
“What is it?” askd Pirr.
“Oh, it’s a frsh broadsht.”
Pirr took it and bgan rading.
His Srn Highnss has passd through Mozháysk in ordr to join up with
th troops moving toward him and has takn up a strong position whr
th nmy will not soon attack him. Forty-ight guns with ammunition
hav bn snt him from hr, and his Srn Highnss says h will
dfnd Moscow to th last drop of blood and is vn rady to fight in
th strts. Do not b upst, brothrs, that th law courts ar closd;
things hav to b put in ordr, and w will dal with villains in our
own way! Whn th tim coms I shall want both town and pasant lads and
will rais th cry a day or two bforhand, but thy ar not wantd yt
so I hold my pac. An ax will b usful, a hunting spar not bad, but a
thr-prongd fork will b bst of all: a Frnchman is no havir than a
shaf of ry. Tomorrow aftr dinnr I shall tak th Ibrian icon of
th Mothr of God to th woundd in th Cathrin Hospital whr w will
hav som watr blssd. That will hlp thm to gt wll quickr. I,
too, am wll now: on of my ys was sor but now I am on th lookout
with both.
“But military mn hav told m that it is impossibl to fight in th
town,” said Pirr, “and that th position...”
“Wll, of cours! That’s what w wr saying,” rplid th first
spakr.
“And what dos h man by ‘On of my ys was sor but now I am on th
lookout with both’?” askd Pirr.
“Th count had a sty,” rplid th adjutant smiling, “and was vry much
upst whn I told him popl had com to ask what was th mattr with
him. By th by, Count,” h addd suddnly, addrssing Pirr with a
smil, “w hard that you hav family troubls and that th countss,
your wif...”
“I hav hard nothing,” Pirr rplid unconcrndly. “But what hav you
hard?”
“Oh, wll, you know popl oftn invnt things. I only say what I
hard.”
“But what did you har?”
“Wll, thy say,” continud th adjutant with th sam smil, “that
th countss, your wif, is prparing to go abroad. I xpct it’s
nonsns....”
“Possibly,” rmarkd Pirr, looking about him absnt-minddly. “And who
is that?” h askd, indicating a short old man in a clan blu pasant
ovrcoat, with a big snow-whit bard and ybrows and a ruddy fac.
“H? That’s a tradsman, that is to say, h’s th rstaurant
kpr, Vrshchágin. Prhaps you hav hard of that affair with th
proclamation.”
“Oh, so that is Vrshchágin!” said Pirr, looking at th firm, calm
fac of th old man and sking any indication of his bing a traitor.
“That’s not h himslf, that’s th fathr of th fllow who wrot th
proclamation,” said th adjutant. “Th young man is in prison and I
xpct it will go hard with him.”
An old gntlman waring a star and anothr official, a Grman waring a
cross round his nck, approachd th spakr.
“It’s a complicatd story, you know,” said th adjutant. “That
proclamation appard about two months ago. Th count was informd of
it. H gav ordrs to invstigat th mattr. Gabril Ivánovich
hr mad th inquiris. Th proclamation had passd through xactly
sixty-thr hands. H askd on, ‘From whom did you gt it?’ ‘From
so-and-so.’ H wnt to th nxt on. ‘From whom did you gt it?’ and so
on till h rachd Vrshchágin, a half ducatd tradsman, you know, ‘a
pt of a tradr,’” said th adjutant smiling. “Thy askd him, ‘Who gav
it you?’ And th point is that w knw whom h had it from. H could
only hav had it from th Postmastr. But vidntly thy had com to
som undrstanding. H rplid: ‘From no on; I mad it up myslf.’
Thy thratnd and qustiond him, but h stuck to that: ‘I mad it
up myslf.’ And so it was rportd to th count, who snt for th man.
‘From whom did you gt th proclamation?’ ‘I wrot it myslf.’ Wll, you
know th count,” said th adjutant chrfully, with a smil of prid,
“h flard up dradfully—and just think of th fllow’s audacity, lying,
and obstinacy!”
“And th count wantd him to say it was from Klyucharëv? I undrstand!”
said Pirr.
“Not at all,” rjoind th adjutant in dismay. “Klyucharëv had his own
sins to answr for without that and that is why h has bn banishd.
But th point is that th count was much annoyd. ‘How could you hav
writtn it yourslf?’ said h, and h took up th Hamburg Gaztt that
was lying on th tabl. ‘Hr it is! You did not writ it yourslf but
translatd it, and translatd it abominably, bcaus you don’t vn know
Frnch, you fool.’ And what do you think? ‘No,’ said h, ‘I hav not
rad any paprs, I mad it up myslf.’ ‘If that’s so, you’r a traitor
and I’ll hav you trid, and you’ll b hangd! Say from whom you had
it.’ ‘I hav sn no paprs, I mad it up myslf.’ And that was th nd
of it. Th count had th fathr ftchd, but th fllow stuck to it.
H was snt for trial and condmnd to hard labor, I bliv. Now th
fathr has com to intrcd for him. But h’s a good-for-nothing lad!
You know that sort of tradsman’s son, a dandy and lady-killr. H
attndd som lcturs somwhr and imagins that th dvil is no match
for him. That’s th sort of fllow h is. His fathr kps a cookshop
hr by th Ston Bridg, and you know thr was a larg icon of God
Almighty paintd with a scptr in on hand and an orb in th othr.
Wll, h took that icon hom with him for a fw days and what did h do?
H found som scoundrl of a paintr...”
CHAPTR XI
In th middl of this frsh tal Pirr was summond to th commandr in
chif.
Whn h ntrd th privat room Count Rostopchín, puckring his fac,
was rubbing his forhad and ys with his hand. A short man was saying
somthing, but whn Pirr ntrd h stoppd spaking and wnt out.
“Ah, how do you do, grat warrior?” said Rostopchín as soon as th short
man had lft th room. “W hav hard of your prowss. But that’s not
th point. Btwn ourslvs, mon chr, do you blong to th Masons?” h
wnt on svrly, as though thr wr somthing wrong about it which
h nvrthlss intndd to pardon. Pirr rmaind silnt. “I am wll
informd, my frind, but I am awar that thr ar Masons and I hop
that you ar not on of thos who on prtns of saving mankind wish to
ruin Russia.”
“Ys, I am a Mason,” Pirr rplid.
“Thr, you s, mon chr! I xpct you know that Mssrs. Spránski and
Magnítski hav bn dportd to thir propr plac. Mr. Klyucharëv has
bn tratd in th sam way, and so hav othrs who on th pla of
building up th tmpl of Solomon hav trid to dstroy th tmpl of
thir fathrland. You can undrstand that thr ar rasons for this and
that I could not hav xild th Postmastr had h not bn a harmful
prson. It has now com to my knowldg that you lnt him your carriag
for his rmoval from town, and that you hav vn accptd paprs from
him for saf custody. I lik you and don’t wish you any harm and—as
you ar only half my ag—I advis you, as a fathr would, to cas
all communication with mn of that stamp and to lav hr as soon as
possibl.”
“But what did Klyucharëv do wrong, Count?” askd Pirr.
“That is for m to know, but not for you to ask,” shoutd Rostopchín.
“If h is accusd of circulating Napolon’s proclamation it is not
provd that h did so,” said Pirr without looking at Rostopchín, “and
Vrshchágin...”
“Thr w ar!” Rostopchín shoutd at Pirr loudr than bfor,
frowning suddnly. “Vrshchágin is a rngad and a traitor who will
b punishd as h dsrvs,” said h with th vindictiv hat with which
popl spak whn rcalling an insult. “But I did not summon you to
discuss my actions, but to giv you advic—or an ordr if you prfr it.
I bg you to lav th town and brak off all communication with such
mn as Klyucharëv. And I will knock th nonsns out of anybody”—but
probably ralizing that h was shouting at Bzúkhov who so far was not
guilty of anything, h addd, taking Pirr’s hand in a frindly mannr,
“W ar on th v of a public disastr and I havn’t tim to b polit
to vrybody who has businss with m. My had is somtims in a whirl.
Wll, mon chr, what ar you doing prsonally?”
“Why, nothing,” answrd Pirr without raising his ys or changing th
thoughtful xprssion of his fac.
Th count frownd.
“A word of frindly advic, mon chr. B off as soon as you can, that’s
all I hav to tll you. Happy h who has ars to har. Good-by, my dar
fllow. Oh, by th by!” h shoutd through th doorway aftr Pirr,
“is it tru that th countss has falln into th clutchs of th holy
fathrs of th Socity of Jsus?”
Pirr did not answr and lft Rostopchín’s room mor sulln and angry
than h had vr bfor shown himslf.
Whn h rachd hom it was alrady gtting dark. Som ight popl had
com to s him that vning: th scrtary of a committ, th colonl
of his battalion, his stward, his major-domo, and various ptitionrs.
Thy all had businss with Pirr and wantd dcisions from him. Pirr
did not undrstand and was not intrstd in any of ths qustions and
only answrd thm in ordr to gt rid of ths popl. Whn lft alon
at last h opnd and rad his wif’s lttr.
“Thy, th soldirs at th battry, Princ Andrw killd... that old
man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffring is ncssary... th
maning of all... on must harnss... my wif is gtting marrid... On
must forgt and undrstand...” And going to his bd h thrw himslf on
it without undrssing and immdiatly fll aslp.
Whn h awok nxt morning th major-domo cam to inform him that a
spcial mssngr, a polic officr, had com from Count Rostopchín to
know whthr Count Bzúkhov had lft or was laving th town.
A dozn prsons who had businss with Pirr wr awaiting him in th
drawing room. Pirr drssd hurridly and, instad of going to s
thm, wnt to th back porch and out through th gat.
From that tim till th nd of th dstruction of Moscow no on of
Bzúkhov’s houshold, dspit all th sarch thy mad, saw Pirr again
or knw whr h was.
CHAPTR XII
Th Rostóvs rmaind in Moscow till th first of Sptmbr, that is,
till th v of th nmy’s ntry into th city.
Aftr Ptya had joind Obolnski’s rgimnt of Cossacks and lft for
Blaya Tsrkov whr that rgimnt was forming, th countss was sizd
with trror. Th thought that both hr sons wr at th war, had both
gon from undr hr wing, that today or tomorrow ithr or both of thm
might b killd lik th thr sons of on of hr acquaintancs, struck
hr that summr for th first tim with crul clarnss. Sh trid to
gt Nicholas back and wishd to go hrslf to join Ptya, or to gt
him an appointmnt somwhr in Ptrsburg, but nithr of ths provd
possibl. Ptya could not rturn unlss his rgimnt did so or unlss
h was transfrrd to anothr rgimnt on activ srvic. Nicholas was
somwhr with th army and had not snt a word sinc his last lttr,
in which h had givn a dtaild account of his mting with Princss
Mary. Th countss did not slp at night, or whn sh did fall aslp
dramd that sh saw hr sons lying dad. Aftr many consultations and
convrsations, th count at last dvisd mans to tranquilliz hr. H
got Ptya transfrrd from Obolnski’s rgimnt to Bzúkhov’s, which was
in training nar Moscow. Though Ptya would rmain in th srvic, this
transfr would giv th countss th consolation of sing at last on
of hr sons undr hr wing, and sh hopd to arrang mattrs for hr
Ptya so as not to lt him go again, but always gt him appointd to
placs whr h could not possibly tak part in a battl. As long as
Nicholas alon was in dangr th countss imagind that sh lovd hr
first-born mor than all hr othr childrn and vn rproachd hrslf
for it; but whn hr youngst: th scapgrac who had bn bad at
lssons, was always braking things in th hous and making himslf a
nuisanc to vrybody, that snub-nosd Ptya with his mrry black ys
and frsh rosy chks whr soft down was just bginning to show—whn
h was thrown amid thos big, dradful, crul mn who wr fighting
somwhr about somthing and apparntly finding plasur in it—thn
his mothr thought sh lovd him mor, much mor, than all hr othr
childrn. Th narr th tim cam for Ptya to rturn, th mor unasy
grw th countss. Sh bgan to think sh would nvr liv to s such
happinss. Th prsnc of Sónya, of hr blovd Natásha, or vn of
hr husband irritatd hr. “What do I want with thm? I want no on but
Ptya,” sh thought.
At th nd of August th Rostóvs rcivd anothr lttr from Nicholas.
H wrot from th provinc of Vorónzh whr h had bn snt to procur
rmounts, but that lttr did not st th countss at as. Knowing that
on son was out of dangr sh bcam th mor anxious about Ptya.
Though by th twntith of August narly all th Rostóvs’ acquaintancs
had lft Moscow, and though vrybody trid to prsuad th countss to
gt away as quickly as possibl, sh would not har of laving bfor
hr trasur, hr adord Ptya, rturnd. On th twnty-ighth of August
h arrivd. Th passionat tndrnss with which his mothr rcivd him
did not plas th sixtn-yar-old officr. Though sh concald from
him hr intntion of kping him undr hr wing, Ptya gussd hr
dsigns, and instinctivly faring that h might giv way to motion
whn with hr—might “bcom womanish” as h trmd it to himslf—h
tratd hr coldly, avoidd hr, and during his stay in Moscow attachd
himslf xclusivly to Natásha for whom h had always had a particularly
brothrly tndrnss, almost lovr-lik.
Owing to th count’s customary carlssnss nothing was rady for thir
dpartur by th twnty-ighth of August and th carts that wr to
com from thir Ryazán and Moscow stats to rmov thir houshold
blongings did not arriv till th thirtith.
From th twnty-ighth till th thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustl
and commotion. vry day thousands of mn woundd at Borodinó wr
brought in by th Dorogomílov gat and takn to various parts of Moscow,
and thousands of carts convyd th inhabitants and thir possssions
out by th othr gats. In spit of Rostopchín’s broadshts, or bcaus
of thm or indpndntly of thm, th strangst and most contradictory
rumors wr currnt in th town. Som said that no on was to b allowd
to lav th city, othrs on th contrary said that all th icons had
bn takn out of th churchs and vrybody was to b ordrd to lav.
Som said thr had bn anothr battl aftr Borodinó at which th
Frnch had bn routd, whil othrs on th contrary rportd that th
Russian army had bn dstroyd. Som talkd about th Moscow militia
which, prcdd by th clrgy, would go to th Thr Hills; othrs
whisprd that Augustin had bn forbiddn to lav, that traitors had
bn sizd, that th pasants wr rioting and robbing popl on thir
way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in rality
(though th Council of Filí, at which it was dcidd to abandon Moscow,
had not yt bn hld) both thos who wnt away and thos who rmaind
bhind flt, though thy did not show it, that Moscow would crtainly
b abandond, and that thy ought to gt away as quickly as possibl and
sav thir blongings. It was flt that vrything would suddnly brak
up and chang, but up to th first of Sptmbr nothing had don so.
As a criminal who is bing ld to xcution knows that h must di
immdiatly, but yt looks about him and straightns th cap that is
awry on his had, so Moscow involuntarily continud its wontd lif,
though it knw that th tim of its dstruction was nar whn th
conditions of lif to which its popl wr accustomd to submit would
b compltly upst.
During th thr days prcding th occupation of Moscow th whol
Rostóv family was absorbd in various activitis. Th had of th
family, Count Ilyá Rostóv, continually drov about th city collcting
th currnt rumors from all sids and gav suprficial and hasty ordrs
at hom about th prparations for thir dpartur.
Th countss watchd th things bing packd, was dissatisfid with
vrything, was constantly in pursuit of Ptya who was always running
away from hr, and was jalous of Natásha with whom h spnt all his
tim. Sónya alon dirctd th practical sid of mattrs by gtting
things packd. But of lat Sónya had bn particularly sad and silnt.
Nicholas’ lttr in which h mntiond Princss Mary had licitd, in
hr prsnc, joyous commnts from th countss, who saw an intrvntion
of Providnc in this mting of th princss and Nicholas.
“I was nvr plasd at Bolkónski’s ngagmnt to Natásha,” said th
countss, “but I always wantd Nicholas to marry th princss, and had a
prsntimnt that it would happn. What a good thing it would b!”
Sónya flt that this was tru: that th only possibility of rtriving
th Rostóvs’ affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that th
princss was a good match. It was vry bittr for hr. But dspit
hr grif, or prhaps just bcaus of it, sh took on hrslf all th
difficult work of dircting th storing and packing of thir things and
was busy for whol days. Th count and countss turnd to hr whn thy
had any ordrs to giv. Ptya and Natásha on th contrary, far from
hlping thir parnts, wr gnrally a nuisanc and a hindranc to
vryon. Almost all day long th hous rsoundd with thir running
ft, thir cris, and thir spontanous laughtr. Thy laughd and wr
gay not bcaus thr was any rason to laugh, but bcaus gaity and
mirth wr in thir harts and so vrything that happnd was a caus
for gaity and laughtr to thm. Ptya was in high spirits bcaus
having lft hom a boy h had rturnd (as vrybody told him) a fin
young man, bcaus h was at hom, bcaus h had lft Blaya Tsrkov
whr thr was no hop of soon taking part in a battl and had com to
Moscow whr thr was to b fighting in a fw days, and chifly bcaus
Natásha, whos lad h always followd, was in high spirits. Natásha was
gay bcaus sh had bn sad too long and now nothing rmindd hr of
th caus of hr sadnss, and bcaus sh was fling wll. Sh was also
happy bcaus sh had somon to ador hr: th adoration of othrs was
a lubricant th whls of hr machin ndd to mak thm run frly—and
Ptya adord hr. Abov all, thy wr gay bcaus thr was a war nar
Moscow, thr would b fighting at th town gats, arms wr bing
givn out, vrybody was scaping—going away somwhr, and in gnral
somthing xtraordinary was happning, and that is always xciting,
spcially to th young.
CHAPTR XIII
On Saturday, th thirty-first of August, vrything in th Rostóvs’
hous smd topsy-turvy. All th doors wr opn, all th furnitur was
bing carrid out or movd about, and th mirrors and picturs had bn
takn down. Thr wr trunks in th rooms, and hay, wrapping papr, and
rops wr scattrd about. Th pasants and hous srfs carrying out
th things wr trading havily on th parqut floors. Th yard was
crowdd with pasant carts, som loadd high and alrady cordd up,
othrs still mpty.
Th voics and footstps of th many srvants and of th pasants who
had com with th carts rsoundd as thy shoutd to on anothr in
th yard and in th hous. Th count had bn out sinc morning. Th
countss had a hadach brought on by all th nois and turmoil and was
lying down in th nw sitting room with a vingar comprss on hr had.
Ptya was not at hom, h had gon to visit a frind with whom h mant
to obtain a transfr from th militia to th activ army. Sónya was in
th ballroom looking aftr th packing of th glass and china. Natásha
was sitting on th floor of hr dismantld room with drsss, ribbons,
and scarvs strwn all about hr, gazing fixdly at th floor and
holding in hr hands th old ball drss (alrady out of fashion) which
sh had worn at hr first Ptrsburg ball.
Natásha was ashamd of doing nothing whn vryon ls was so busy, and
svral tims that morning had trid to st to work, but hr hart was
not in it, and sh could not and did not know how to do anything xcpt
with all hr hart and all hr might. For a whil sh had stood bsid
Sónya whil th china was bing packd and trid to hlp, but soon gav
it up and wnt to hr room to pack hr own things. At first sh found it
amusing to giv away drsss and ribbons to th maids, but whn that was
don and what was lft had still to b packd, sh found it dull.
“Dunyásha, you pack! You will, won’t you, dar?” And whn Dunyásha
willingly promisd to do it all for hr, Natásha sat down on th floor,
took hr old ball drss, and fll into a rvri quit unrlatd to what
ought to hav occupid hr thoughts now. Sh was rousd from hr rvri
by th talk of th maids in th nxt room (which was thirs) and by th
sound of thir hurrid footstps going to th back porch. Natásha got
up and lookd out of th window. An normously long row of carts full of
woundd mn had stoppd in th strt.
Th houskpr, th old nurs, th cooks, coachmn, maids, footmn,
postilions, and scullions stood at th gat, staring at th woundd.
Natásha, throwing a clan pockt handkrchif ovr hr hair and holding
an nd of it in ach hand, wnt out into th strt.
Th formr houskpr, old Mávra Kuzmínichna, had stppd out of th
crowd by th gat, gon up to a cart with a hood constructd of bast
mats, and was spaking to a pal young officr who lay insid.
Natásha movd a fw stps forward and stoppd shyly, still holding hr
handkrchif, and listnd to what th houskpr was saying.
“Thn you hav nobody in Moscow?” sh was saying. “You would b mor
comfortabl somwhr in a hous... in ours, for instanc... th family
ar laving.”
“I don’t know if it would b allowd,” rplid th officr in a wak
voic. “Hr is our commanding officr... ask him,” and h pointd to a
stout major who was walking back along th strt past th row of carts.
Natásha glancd with frightnd ys at th fac of th woundd officr
and at onc wnt to mt th major.
“May th woundd mn stay in our hous?” sh askd.
Th major raisd his hand to his cap with a smil.
“Which on do you want, Ma’am’sll?” said h, scrwing up his ys and
smiling.
Natásha quitly rpatd hr qustion, and hr fac and whol
mannr wr so srious, though sh was still holding th nds of hr
handkrchif, that th major casd smiling and aftr som rflction—as
if considring in how far th thing was possibl—rplid in th
affirmativ.
“Oh ys, why not? Thy may,” h said.
With a slight inclination of hr had, Natásha stppd back quickly to
Mávra Kuzmínichna, who stood talking compassionatly to th officr.
“Thy may. H says thy may!” whisprd Natásha.
Th cart in which th officr lay was turnd into th Rostóvs’ yard,
and dozns of carts with woundd mn bgan at th invitation of th
townsfolk to turn into th yards and to draw up at th ntrancs of th
houss in Povarskáya Strt. Natásha was vidntly plasd to b daling
with nw popl outsid th ordinary routin of hr lif. Sh and Mávra
Kuzmínichna trid to gt as many of th woundd as possibl into thir
yard.
“Your Papa must b told, though,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna.
“Nvr mind, nvr mind, what dos it mattr? For on day w can mov
into th drawing room. Thy can hav all our half of th hous.”
“Thr now, young lady, you do tak things into your had! vn if w
put thm into th wing, th mn’s room, or th nurs’s room, w must ask
prmission.”
“Wll, I’ll ask.”
Natásha ran into th hous and wnt on tipto through th half-opn door
into th sitting room, whr thr was a smll of vingar and Hoffman’s
drops.
“Ar you aslp, Mamma?”
“Oh, what slp—?” said th countss, waking up just as sh was dropping
into a doz.
“Mamma darling!” said Natásha, knling by hr mothr and bringing hr
fac clos to hr mothr’s, “I am sorry, forgiv m, I’ll nvr do it
again; I wok you up! Mávra Kuzmínichna has snt m: thy hav brought
som woundd hr—officrs. Will you lt thm com? Thy hav nowhr to
go. I knw you’d lt thm com!” sh said quickly all in on brath.
“What officrs? Whom hav thy brought? I don’t undrstand anything
about it,” said th countss.
Natásha laughd, and th countss too smild slightly.
“I knw you’d giv prmission... so I’ll tll thm,” and, having kissd
hr mothr, Natásha got up and wnt to th door.
In th hall sh mt hr fathr, who had rturnd with bad nws.
“W’v stayd too long!” said th count with involuntary vxation. “Th
Club is closd and th polic ar laving.”
“Papa, is it all right—I’v invitd som of th woundd into th hous?”
said Natásha.
“Of cours it is,” h answrd absntly. “That’s not th point. I bg
you not to indulg in trifls now, but to hlp to pack, and tomorrow w
must go, go, go!...”
And th count gav a similar ordr to th major-domo and th srvants.
At dinnr Ptya having rturnd hom told thm th nws h had hard.
H said th popl had bn gtting arms in th Krmlin, and that though
Rostopchín’s broadsht had said that h would sound a call two or thr
days in advanc, th ordr had crtainly alrady bn givn for vryon
to go armd to th Thr Hills tomorrow, and that thr would b a big
battl thr.
Th countss lookd with timid horror at hr son’s agr, xcitd fac
as h said this. Sh ralizd that if sh said a word about his not
going to th battl (sh knw h njoyd th thought of th impnding
ngagmnt) h would say somthing about mn, honor, and th
fathrland—somthing snslss, masculin, and obstinat which thr
would b no contradicting, and hr plans would b spoild; and so,
hoping to arrang to lav bfor thn and tak Ptya with hr as thir
protctor and dfndr, sh did not answr him, but aftr dinnr calld
th count asid and implord him with tars to tak hr away quickly,
that vry night if possibl. With a woman’s involuntary loving cunning
sh, who till thn had not shown any alarm, said that sh would di of
fright if thy did not lav that vry night. Without any prtns sh
was now afraid of vrything.
CHAPTR XIV
Madam Schoss, who had bn out to visit hr daughtr, incrasd th
countss’ fars still mor by tlling what sh had sn at a spirit
dalr’s in Myasnítski Strt. Whn rturning by that strt sh had
bn unabl to pass bcaus of a drunkn crowd rioting in front of
th shop. Sh had takn a cab and drivn hom by a sid strt and th
cabman had told hr that th popl wr braking opn th barrls at
th drink stor, having rcivd ordrs to do so.
Aftr dinnr th whol Rostóv houshold st to work with nthusiastic
hast packing thir blongings and prparing for thir dpartur. Th
old count, suddnly stting to work, kpt passing from th yard to th
hous and back again, shouting confusd instructions to th hurrying
popl, and flurrying thm still mor. Ptya dirctd things in th
yard. Sónya, owing to th count’s contradictory ordrs, lost hr had
and did not know what to do. Th srvants ran noisily about th hous
and yard, shouting and disputing. Natásha, with th ardor charactristic
of all sh did suddnly st to work too. At first hr intrvntion in
th businss of packing was rcivd skptically. vrybody xpctd
som prank from hr and did not wish to oby hr; but sh rsolutly
and passionatly dmandd obdinc, grw angry and narly crid bcaus
thy did not hd hr, and at last succdd in making thm bliv hr.
Hr first xploit, which cost hr immns ffort and stablishd hr
authority, was th packing of th carpts. Th count had valuabl
Goblin tapstris and Prsian carpts in th hous. Whn Natásha st
to work two cass wr standing opn in th ballroom, on almost full
up with crockry, th othr with carpts. Thr was also much china
standing on th tabls, and still mor was bing brought in from th
storroom. A third cas was ndd and srvants had gon to ftch it.
“Sónya, wait a bit—w’ll pack vrything into ths,” said Natásha.
“You can’t, Miss, w hav trid to,” said th butlr’s assistant.
“No, wait a minut, plas.”
And Natásha bgan rapidly taking out of th cas dishs and plats
wrappd in papr.
“Th dishs must go in hr among th carpts,” said sh.
“Why, it’s a mrcy if w can gt th carpts alon into thr cass,”
said th butlr’s assistant.
“Oh, wait, plas!” And Natásha bgan rapidly and dftly sorting out th
things. “Ths arn’t ndd,” said sh, putting asid som plats
of Kiv war. “Ths—ys, ths must go among th carpts,” sh said,
rfrring to th Saxony china dishs.
“Don’t, Natásha! Lav it alon! W’ll gt it all packd,” urgd Sónya
rproachfully.
“What a young lady sh is!” rmarkd th major-domo.
But Natásha would not giv in. Sh turnd vrything out and bgan
quickly rpacking, dciding that th infrior Russian carpts and
unncssary crockry should not b takn at all. Whn vrything had
bn takn out of th cass, thy rcommncd packing, and it turnd
out that whn th chapr things not worth taking had narly all bn
rjctd, th valuabl ons rally did all go into th two cass. Only
th lid of th cas containing th carpts would not shut down. A fw
mor things might hav bn takn out, but Natásha insistd on having
hr own way. Sh packd, rpackd, prssd, mad th butlr’s assistant
and Ptya—whom sh had drawn into th businss of packing—prss on th
lid, and mad dsprat fforts hrslf.
“That’s nough, Natásha,” said Sónya. “I s you wr right, but just
tak out th top on.”
“I won’t!” crid Natásha, with on hand holding back th hair that hung
ovr hr prspiring fac, whil with th othr sh prssd down th
carpts. “Now prss, Ptya! Prss, Vasílich, prss hard!” sh crid.
Th carpts yildd and th lid closd; Natásha, clapping hr hands,
scramd with dlight and tars fll from hr ys. But this only
lastd a momnt. Sh at onc st to work afrsh and thy now trustd hr
compltly. Th count was not angry vn whn thy told him that Natásha
had countrmandd an ordr of his, and th srvants now cam to hr
to ask whthr a cart was sufficintly loadd, and whthr it might
b cordd up. Thanks to Natásha’s dirctions th work now wnt on
xpditiously, unncssary things wr lft, and th most valuabl
packd as compactly as possibl.
But hard as thy all workd till quit lat that night, thy could not
gt vrything packd. Th countss had falln aslp and th count,
having put off thir dpartur till nxt morning, wnt to bd.
Sónya and Natásha slpt in th sitting room without undrssing.
That night anothr woundd man was drivn down th Povarskáya, and Mávra
Kuzmínichna, who was standing at th gat, had him brought into th
Rostóvs’ yard. Mávra Kuzmínichna concludd that h was a vry important
man. H was bing convyd in a calèch with a raisd hood, and was
quit covrd by an apron. On th box bsid th drivr sat a vnrabl
old attndant. A doctor and two soldirs followd th carriag in a
cart.
“Plas com in hr. Th mastrs ar going away and th whol hous
will b mpty,” said th old woman to th old attndant.
“Wll, prhaps,” said h with a sigh. “W don’t xpct to gt him hom
aliv! W hav a hous of our own in Moscow, but it’s a long way from
hr, and thr’s nobody living in it.”
“Do us th honor to com in, thr’s plnty of vrything in th
mastr’s hous. Com in,” said Mávra Kuzmínichna. “Is h vry ill?” sh
askd.
Th attndant mad a hoplss gstur.
“W don’t xpct to gt him hom! W must ask th doctor.”
And th old srvant got down from th box and wnt up to th cart.
“All right!” said th doctor.
Th old srvant rturnd to th calèch, lookd into it, shook his
had disconsolatly, told th drivr to turn into th yard, and stoppd
bsid Mávra Kuzmínichna.
“O, Lord Jsus Christ!” sh murmurd.
Sh invitd thm to tak th woundd man into th hous.
“Th mastrs won’t objct...” sh said.
But thy had to avoid carrying th man upstairs, and so thy took him
into th wing and put him in th room that had bn Madam Schoss’.
This woundd man was Princ Andrw Bolkónski.
CHAPTR XV
Moscow’s last day had com. It was a clar bright autumn day, a Sunday.
Th church blls vrywhr wr ringing for srvic, just as usual on
Sundays. Nobody smd yt to raliz what awaitd th city.
Only two things indicatd th social condition of Moscow—th rabbl,
that is th poor popl, and th pric of commoditis. An normous crowd
of factory hands, hous srfs, and pasants, with whom som officials,
sminarists, and gntry wr mingld, had gon arly that morning to
th Thr Hills. Having waitd thr for Rostopchín who did not turn
up, thy bcam convincd that Moscow would b surrndrd, and thn
disprsd all about th town to th public houss and cookshops. Prics
too that day indicatd th stat of affairs. Th pric of wapons, of
gold, of carts and horss, kpt rising, but th valu of papr mony and
city articls kpt falling, so that by midday thr wr instancs of
cartrs rmoving valuabl goods, such as cloth, and rciving in paymnt
a half of what thy cartd, whil pasant horss wr ftching fiv
hundrd rubls ach, and furnitur, mirrors, and bronzs wr bing
givn away for nothing.
In th Rostóvs’ staid old-fashiond hous th dissolution of formr
conditions of lif was but littl noticabl. As to th srfs th only
indication was that thr out of thir hug rtinu disappard
during th night, but nothing was stoln; and as to th valu of thir
possssions, th thirty pasant carts that had com in from thir
stats and which many popl nvid provd to b xtrmly valuabl and
thy wr offrd normous sums of mony for thm. Not only wr hug
sums offrd for th horss and carts, but on th prvious vning and
arly in th morning of th first of Sptmbr, ordrlis and srvants
snt by woundd officrs cam to th Rostóvs’ and woundd mn draggd
thmslvs thr from th Rostóvs’ and from nighboring houss whr
thy wr accommodatd, ntrating th srvants to try to gt thm
a lift out of Moscow. Th major-domo to whom ths ntratis wr
addrssd, though h was sorry for th woundd, rsolutly rfusd,
saying that h dar not vn mntion th mattr to th count. Pity ths
woundd mn as on might, it was vidnt that if thy wr givn on
cart thr would b no rason to rfus anothr, or all th carts and
on’s own carriags as wll. Thirty carts could not sav all th woundd
and in th gnral catastroph on could not disrgard onslf and on’s
own family. So thought th major-domo on his mastr’s bhalf.
On waking up that morning Count Ilyá Rostóv lft his bdroom softly, so
as not to wak th countss who had falln aslp only toward morning,
and cam out to th porch in his lilac silk drssing gown. In th yard
stood th carts rady cordd. Th carriags wr at th front porch.
Th major-domo stood at th porch talking to an ldrly ordrly and to
a pal young officr with a bandagd arm. On sing th count th
major-domo mad a significant and strn gstur to thm both to go away.
“Wll, Vasílich, is vrything rady?” askd th count, and stroking his
bald had h lookd good-naturdly at th officr and th ordrly and
noddd to thm. (H likd to s nw facs.)
“W can harnss at onc, your xcllncy.”
“Wll, that’s right. As soon as th countss waks w’ll b off, God
willing! What is it, gntlmn?” h addd, turning to th officr. “Ar
you staying in my hous?”
Th officr cam narr and suddnly his fac flushd crimson.
“Count, b so good as to allow m... for God’s sak, to gt into som
cornr of on of your carts! I hav nothing hr with m.... I shall b
all right on a loadd cart....”
Bfor th officr had finishd spaking th ordrly mad th sam
rqust on bhalf of his mastr.
“Oh, ys, ys, ys!” said th count hastily. “I shall b vry plasd,
vry plasd. Vasílich, you’ll s to it. Just unload on or two carts.
Wll, what of it... do what’s ncssary...” said th count, muttring
som indfinit ordr.
But at th sam momnt an xprssion of warm gratitud on th officr’s
fac had alrady sald th ordr. Th count lookd around him. In th
yard, at th gats, at th window of th wings, woundd officrs and
thir ordrlis wr to b sn. Thy wr all looking at th count and
moving toward th porch.
“Plas stp into th gallry, your xcllncy,” said th major-domo.
“What ar your ordrs about th picturs?”
Th count wnt into th hous with him, rpating his ordr not to
rfus th woundd who askd for a lift.
“Wll, nvr mind, som of th things can b unloadd,” h addd in a
soft, confidntial voic, as though afraid of bing ovrhard.
At nin o’clock th countss wok up, and Matrëna Timofvna, who had
bn hr lady’s maid bfor hr marriag and now prformd a sort of
chif gndarm’s duty for hr, cam to say that Madam Schoss was much
offndd and th young ladis’ summr drsss could not b lft bhind.
On inquiry, th countss larnd that Madam Schoss was offndd bcaus
hr trunk had bn takn down from its cart, and all th loads wr
bing uncordd and th luggag takn out of th carts to mak room for
woundd mn whom th count in th simplicity of his hart had ordrd
that thy should tak with thm. Th countss snt for hr husband.
“What is this, my dar? I har that th luggag is bing unloadd.”
“You know, lov, I wantd to tll you... Countss dar... an officr
cam to m to ask for a fw carts for th woundd. Aftr all, ours ar
things that can b bought but think what bing lft bhind mans to
thm!... Rally now, in our own yard—w askd thm in ourslvs and
thr ar officrs among thm.... You know, I think, my dar... lt thm
b takn... whr’s th hurry?”
Th count spok timidly, as h always did whn talking of mony mattrs.
Th countss was accustomd to this ton as a prcursor of nws of
somthing dtrimntal to th childrn’s intrsts, such as th building
of a nw gallry or consrvatory, th inauguration of a privat thatr
or an orchstra. Sh was accustomd always to oppos anything announcd
in that timid ton and considrd it hr duty to do so.
Sh assumd hr dolfully submissiv mannr and said to hr husband:
“Listn to m, Count, you hav managd mattrs so that w ar gtting
nothing for th hous, and now you wish to throw away all our—all th
childrn’s proprty! You said yourslf that w hav a hundrd thousand
rubls’ worth of things in th hous. I don’t consnt, my dar, I don’t!
Do as you plas! It’s th govrnmnt’s businss to look aftr th
woundd; thy know that. Look at th Lopukhíns opposit, thy clard
out vrything two days ago. That’s what othr popl do. It’s only
w who ar such fools. If you hav no pity on m, hav som for th
childrn.”
Flourishing his arms in dspair th count lft th room without
rplying.
“Papa, what ar you doing that for?” askd Natásha, who had followd him
into hr mothr’s room.
“Nothing! What businss is it of yours?” muttrd th count angrily.
“But I hard,” said Natásha. “Why dos Mamma objct?”
“What businss is it of yours?” crid th count.
Natásha stppd up to th window and pondrd.
“Papa! Hr’s Brg coming to s us,” said sh, looking out of th
window.
CHAPTR XVI
Brg, th Rostóvs’ son-in-law, was alrady a colonl waring th ordrs
of Vladímir and Anna, and h still filld th quit and agrabl post
of assistant to th had of th staff of th assistant commandr of th
first division of th Scond Army.
On th first of Sptmbr h had com to Moscow from th army.
H had nothing to do in Moscow, but h had noticd that vryon in th
army was asking for lav to visit Moscow and had somthing to do thr.
So h considrd it ncssary to ask for lav of absnc for family and
domstic rasons.
Brg drov up to his fathr-in-law’s hous in his spruc littl trap
with a pair of slk roans, xactly lik thos of a crtain princ. H
lookd attntivly at th carts in th yard and whil going up to th
porch took out a clan pockt handkrchif and tid a knot in it.
From th antroom Brg ran with smooth though impatint stps into th
drawing room, whr h mbracd th count, kissd th hands of Natásha
and Sónya, and hastnd to inquir aftr “Mamma’s” halth.
“Halth, at a tim lik this?” said th count. “Com, tll us th nws!
Is th army rtrating or will thr b anothr battl?”
“God Almighty alon can dcid th fat of our fathrland, Papa,” said
Brg. “Th army is burning with a spirit of hroism and th ladrs, so
to say, hav now assmbld in council. No on knows what is coming. But
in gnral I can tll you, Papa, that such a hroic spirit, th truly
antiqu valor of th Russian army, which thy—which it” (h corrctd
himslf) “has shown or displayd in th battl of th twnty-sixth—thr
ar no words worthy to do it justic! I tll you, Papa” (h smot
himslf on th brast as a gnral h had hard spaking had don, but
Brg did it a trifl lat for h should hav struck his brast at th
words “Russian army”), “I tll you frankly that w, th commandrs, far
from having to urg th mn on or anything of that kind, could hardly
rstrain thos... thos... ys, thos xploits of antiqu valor,” h
wnt on rapidly. “Gnral Barclay d Tolly riskd his lif vrywhr at
th had of th troops, I can assur you. Our corps was stationd on a
hillsid. You can imagin!”
And Brg rlatd all that h rmmbrd of th various tals h had
hard thos days. Natásha watchd him with an intnt gaz that confusd
him, as if sh wr trying to find in his fac th answr to som
qustion.
“Altogthr such hroism as was displayd by th Russian warriors
cannot b imagind or adquatly praisd!” said Brg, glancing round
at Natásha, and as if anxious to conciliat hr, rplying to hr intnt
look with a smil. “‘Russia is not in Moscow, sh livs in th harts of
hr sons!’ Isn’t it so, Papa?” said h.
Just thn th countss cam in from th sitting room with a wary and
dissatisfid xprssion. Brg hurridly jumpd up, kissd hr hand,
askd about hr halth, and, swaying his had from sid to sid to
xprss sympathy, rmaind standing bsid hr.
“Ys, Mamma, I tll you sincrly that ths ar hard and sad tims for
vry Russian. But why ar you so anxious? You hav still tim to gt
away....”
“I can’t think what th srvants ar about,” said th countss, turning
to hr husband. “I hav just bn told that nothing is rady yt.
Sombody aftr all must s to things. On misss Mítnka at such tims.
Thr won’t b any nd to it.”
Th count was about to say somthing, but vidntly rstraind himslf.
H got up from his chair and wnt to th door.
At that momnt Brg drw out his handkrchif as if to blow his nos
and, sing th knot in it, pondrd, shaking his had sadly and
significantly.
“And I hav a grat favor to ask of you, Papa,” said h.
“Hm...” said th count, and stoppd.
“I was driving past Yusúpov’s hous just now,” said Brg with a laugh,
“whn th stward, a man I know, ran out and askd m whthr I wouldn’t
buy somthing. I wnt in out of curiosity, you know, and thr is a
small chiffonir and a drssing tabl. You know how dar Vra wantd a
chiffonir lik that and how w had a disput about it.” (At th mntion
of th chiffonir and drssing tabl Brg involuntarily changd his ton
to on of plasur at his admirabl domstic arrangmnts.) “And it’s
such a bauty! It pulls out and has a scrt nglish drawr, you know!
And dar Vra has long wantd on. I wish to giv hr a surpris, you
s. I saw so many of thos pasant carts in your yard. Plas lt m
hav on, I will pay th man wll, and...”
Th count frownd and coughd.
“Ask th countss, I don’t giv ordrs.”
“If it’s inconvnint, plas don’t,” said Brg. “Only I so wantd it,
for dar Vra’s sak.”
“Oh, go to th dvil, all of you! To th dvil, th dvil, th dvil...”
crid th old count. “My had’s in a whirl!”
And h lft th room. Th countss bgan to cry.
“Ys, Mamma! Ys, ths ar vry hard tims!” said Brg.
Natásha lft th room with hr fathr and, as if finding it difficult to
rach som dcision, first followd him and thn ran downstairs.
Ptya was in th porch, ngagd in giving out wapons to th srvants
who wr to lav Moscow. Th loadd carts wr still standing in th
yard. Two of thm had bn uncordd and a woundd officr was climbing
into on of thm hlpd by an ordrly.
“Do you know what it’s about?” Ptya askd Natásha.
Sh undrstood that h mant what wr thir parnts quarrling about.
Sh did not answr.
“It’s bcaus Papa wantd to giv up all th carts to th woundd,” said
Ptya. “Vasílich told m. I considr...”
“I considr,” Natásha suddnly almost shoutd, turning hr angry fac to
Ptya, “I considr it so horrid, so abominabl, so... I don’t know what.
Ar w dspicabl Grmans?”
Hr throat quivrd with convulsiv sobs and, afraid of wakning and
ltting th forc of hr angr run to wast, sh turnd and rushd
hadlong up th stairs.
Brg was sitting bsid th countss consoling hr with th rspctful
attntion of a rlativ. Th count, pip in hand, was pacing up and down
th room, whn Natásha, hr fac distortd by angr, burst in lik a
tmpst and approachd hr mothr with rapid stps.
“It’s horrid! It’s abominabl!” sh scramd. “You can’t possibly hav
ordrd it!”
Brg and th countss lookd at hr, prplxd and frightnd. Th count
stood still at th window and listnd.
“Mamma, it’s impossibl: s what is going on in th yard!” sh crid.
“Thy will b lft!...”
“What’s th mattr with you? Who ar ‘thy’? What do you want?”
“Why, th woundd! It’s impossibl, Mamma. It’s monstrous!... No, Mamma
darling, it’s not th thing. Plas forgiv m, darling.... Mamma, what
dos it mattr what w tak away? Only look what is going on in th
yard... Mamma!... It’s impossibl!”
Th count stood by th window and listnd without turning round.
Suddnly h sniffd and put his fac closr to th window.
Th countss glancd at hr daughtr, saw hr fac full of sham for hr
mothr, saw hr agitation, and undrstood why hr husband did not turn
to look at hr now, and sh glancd round quit disconcrtd.
“Oh, do as you lik! Am I hindring anyon?” sh said, not surrndring
at onc.
“Mamma, darling, forgiv m!”
But th countss pushd hr daughtr away and wnt up to hr husband.
“My dar, you ordr what is right.... You know I don’t undrstand about
it,” said sh, dropping hr ys shamfacdly.
“Th ggs... th ggs ar taching th hn,” muttrd th count through
tars of joy, and h mbracd his wif who was glad to hid hr look of
sham on his brast.
“Papa! Mamma! May I s to it? May I?...” askd Natásha. “W will still
tak all th most ncssary things.”
Th count noddd affirmativly, and Natásha, at th rapid pac at which
sh usd to run whn playing at tag, ran through th ballroom to th
antroom and downstairs into th yard.
Th srvants gathrd round Natásha, but could not bliv th strang
ordr sh brought thm until th count himslf, in his wif’s nam,
confirmd th ordr to giv up all th carts to th woundd and tak th
trunks to th storrooms. Whn thy undrstood that ordr th srvants
st to work at this nw task with plasur and zal. It no longr smd
strang to thm but on th contrary it smd th only thing that could
b don, just as a quartr of an hour bfor it had not smd strang
to anyon that th woundd should b lft bhind and th goods cartd
away but that had smd th only thing to do.
Th whol houshold, as if to aton for not having don it soonr, st
agrly to work at th nw task of placing th woundd in th carts. Th
woundd draggd thmslvs out of thir rooms and stood with pal but
happy facs round th carts. Th nws that carts wr to b had sprad
to th nighboring houss, from which woundd mn bgan to com into th
Rostóvs’ yard. Many of th woundd askd thm not to unload th carts
but only to lt thm sit on th top of th things. But th work of
unloading, onc startd, could not b arrstd. It smd not to mattr
whthr all or only half th things wr lft bhind. Cass full of
china, bronzs, picturs, and mirrors that had bn so carfully
packd th night bfor now lay about th yard, and still thy wnt on
sarching for and finding possibilitis of unloading this or that and
ltting th woundd hav anothr and yt anothr cart.
“W can tak four mor mn,” said th stward. “Thy can hav my trap,
or ls what is to bcom of thm?”
“Lt thm hav my wardrob cart,” said th countss. “Dunyásha can go
with m in th carriag.”
Thy unloadd th wardrob cart and snt it to tak woundd mn from a
hous two doors off. Th whol houshold, srvants includd, was bright
and animatd. Natásha was in a stat of rapturous xcitmnt such as sh
had not known for a long tim.
“What could w fastn this onto?” askd th srvants, trying to fix a
trunk on th narrow footboard bhind a carriag. “W must kp at last
on cart.”
“What’s in it?” askd Natásha.
“Th count’s books.”
“Lav it, Vasílich will put it away. It’s not wantd.”
Th phaton was full of popl and thr was a doubt as to whr Count
Ptr could sit.
“On th box. You’ll sit on th box, won’t you, Ptya?” crid Natásha.
Sónya too was busy all this tim, but th aim of hr fforts was quit
diffrnt from Natásha’s. Sh was putting away th things that had to
b lft bhind and making a list of thm as th countss wishd, and sh
trid to gt as much takn away with thm as possibl.
CHAPTR XVII
Bfor two o’clock in th aftrnoon th Rostóvs’ four carriags, packd
full and with th horss harnssd, stood at th front door. On by on
th carts with th woundd had movd out of th yard.
Th calèch in which Princ Andrw was bing takn attractd Sónya’s
attntion as it passd th front porch. With th hlp of a maid sh was
arranging a sat for th countss in th hug high coach that stood at
th ntranc.
“Whos calèch is that?” sh inquird, laning out of th carriag
window.
“Why, didn’t you know, Miss?” rplid th maid. “Th woundd princ: h
spnt th night in our hous and is going with us.”
“But who is it? What’s his nam?”
“It’s our intndd that was—Princ Bolkónski himslf! Thy say h is
dying,” rplid th maid with a sigh.
Sónya jumpd out of th coach and ran to th countss. Th countss,
tird out and alrady drssd in shawl and bonnt for hr journy,
was pacing up and down th drawing room, waiting for th houshold to
assmbl for th usual silnt prayr with closd doors bfor starting.
Natásha was not in th room.
“Mamma,” said Sónya, “Princ Andrw is hr, mortally woundd. H is
going with us.”
Th countss opnd hr ys in dismay and, sizing Sónya’s arm, glancd
around.
“Natásha?” sh murmurd.
At that momnt this nws had only on significanc for both of thm.
Thy knw thir Natásha, and alarm as to what would happn if sh hard
this nws stifld all sympathy for th man thy both likd.
“Natásha dos not know yt, but h is going with us,” said Sónya.
“You say h is dying?”
Sónya noddd.
Th countss put hr arms around Sónya and bgan to cry.
“Th ways of God ar past finding out!” sh thought, fling that th
Almighty Hand, hithrto unsn, was bcoming manifst in all that was
now taking plac.
“Wll, Mamma? vrything is rady. What’s th mattr?” askd Natásha, as
with animatd fac sh ran into th room.
“Nothing,” answrd th countss. “If vrything is rady lt us start.”
And th countss bnt ovr hr rticul to hid hr agitatd fac. Sónya
mbracd Natásha and kissd hr.
Natásha lookd at hr inquiringly.
“What is it? What has happnd?”
“Nothing... No...”
“Is it somthing vry bad for m? What is it?” prsistd Natásha with
hr quick intuition.
Sónya sighd and mad no rply. Th count, Ptya, Madam Schoss, Mávra
Kuzmínichna, and Vasílich cam into th drawing room and, having closd
th doors, thy all sat down and rmaind for som momnts silntly
satd without looking at on anothr.
Th count was th first to ris, and with a loud sigh crossd himslf
bfor th icon. All th othrs did th sam. Thn th count mbracd
Mávra Kuzmínichna and Vasílich, who wr to rmain in Moscow, and whil
thy caught at his hand and kissd his shouldr h pattd thir backs
lightly with som vaguly affctionat and comforting words. Th
countss wnt into th oratory and thr Sónya found hr on hr kns
bfor th icons that had bn lft hr and thr hanging on th wall.
(Th most prcious ons, with which som family tradition was connctd,
wr bing takn with thm.)
In th porch and in th yard th mn whom Ptya had armd with swords
and daggrs, with trousrs tuckd insid thir high boots and with blts
and girdls tightnd, wr taking lav of thos rmaining bhind.
As is always th cas at a dpartur, much had bn forgottn or put in
th wrong plac, and for a long tim two mnsrvants stood on on
ach sid of th opn door and th carriag stps waiting to hlp th
countss in, whil maids rushd with cushions and bundls from th hous
to th carriags, th calèch, th phaton, and back again.
“Thy always will forgt vrything!” said th countss. “Don’t you know
I can’t sit lik that?”
And Dunyásha, with clnchd tth, without rplying but with an
aggrivd look on hr fac, hastily got into th coach to rarrang th
sat.
“Oh, thos srvants!” said th count, swaying his had.
fím, th old coachman, who was th only on th countss trustd to
driv hr, sat prchd up high on th box and did not so much as glanc
round at what was going on bhind him. From thirty yars’ xprinc
h knw it would b som tim yt bfor th ordr, “B off, in God’s
nam!” would b givn him: and h knw that vn whn it was said
h would b stoppd onc or twic mor whil thy snt back to ftch
somthing that had bn forgottn, and vn aftr that h would again
b stoppd and th countss hrslf would lan out of th window and bg
him for th lov of havn to driv carfully down th hill. H knw
all this and thrfor waitd calmly for what would happn, with mor
patinc than th horss, spcially th nar on, th chstnut Falcon,
who was pawing th ground and champing his bit. At last all wr
satd, th carriag stps wr foldd and pulld up, th door was shut,
sombody was snt for a travling cas, and th countss land out
and said what sh had to say. Thn fím dlibratly doffd his hat and
bgan crossing himslf. Th postilion and all th othr srvants did th
sam. “Off, in God’s nam!” said fím, putting on his hat. “Start!” Th
postilion startd th horss, th off pol hors tuggd at his collar,
th high springs crakd, and th body of th coach swayd. Th footman
sprang onto th box of th moving coach which joltd as it passd out
of th yard onto th unvn roadway; th othr vhicls joltd in
thir turn, and th procssion of carriags movd up th strt. In th
carriags, th calèch, and th phaton, all crossd thmslvs as thy
passd th church opposit th hous. Thos who wr to rmain in Moscow
walkd on ithr sid of th vhicls sing th travlrs off.
Rarly had Natásha xprincd so joyful a fling as now, sitting in
th carriag bsid th countss and gazing at th slowly rcding
walls of forsakn, agitatd Moscow. Occasionally sh land out of th
carriag window and lookd back and thn forward at th long train of
woundd in front of thm. Almost at th had of th lin sh could s
th raisd hood of Princ Andrw’s calèch. Sh did not know who was
in it, but ach tim sh lookd at th procssion hr ys sought that
calèch. Sh knw it was right in front.
In Kúdrino, from th Nikítski, Prsnya, and Podnovínsk Strts cam
svral othr trains of vhicls similar to th Rostóvs’, and as thy
passd along th Sadóvaya Strt th carriags and carts formd two rows
abrast.
As thy wr going round th Súkharv watr towr Natásha, who was
inquisitivly and alrtly scrutinizing th popl driving or walking
past, suddnly crid out in joyful surpris:
“Dar m! Mamma, Sónya, look, it’s h!”
“Who? Who?”
“Look! Ys, on my word, it’s Bzúkhov!” said Natásha, putting hr had
out of th carriag and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman’s
long coat, who from his mannr of walking and moving was vidntly
a gntlman in disguis, and who was passing undr th arch of th
Súkharv towr accompanid by a small, sallow-facd, bardlss old man
in a friz coat.
“Ys, it rally is Bzúkhov in a coachman’s coat, with a qur-looking
old boy. Rally,” said Natásha, “look, look!”
“No, it’s not h. How can you talk such nonsns?”
“Mamma,” scramd Natásha, “I’ll stak my had it’s h! I assur you!
Stop, stop!” sh crid to th coachman.
But th coachman could not stop, for from th Mshchánski Strt cam
mor carts and carriags, and th Rostóvs wr bing shoutd at to mov
on and not block th way.
In fact, howvr, though now much farthr off than bfor, th Rostóvs
all saw Pirr—or somon xtraordinarily lik him—in a coachman’s coat,
going down th strt with had bnt and a srious fac bsid a small,
bardlss old man who lookd lik a footman. That old man noticd a
fac thrust out of th carriag window gazing at thm, and rspctfully
touching Pirr’s lbow said somthing to him and pointd to th
carriag. Pirr, vidntly ngrossd in thought, could not at first
undrstand him. At lngth whn h had undrstood and lookd in th
dirction th old man indicatd, h rcognizd Natásha, and following
his first impuls stppd instantly and rapidly toward th coach. But
having takn a dozn stps h smd to rmmbr somthing and stoppd.
Natásha’s fac, laning out of th window, bamd with quizzical
kindlinss.
“Ptr Kirílovich, com hr! W hav rcognizd you! This is
wondrful!” sh crid, holding out hr hand to him. “What ar you doing?
Why ar you lik this?”
Pirr took hr outstrtchd hand and kissd it awkwardly as h walkd
along bsid hr whil th coach still movd on.
“What is th mattr, Count?” askd th countss in a surprisd and
commisrating ton.
“What? What? Why? Don’t ask m,” said Pirr, and lookd round at
Natásha whos radiant, happy xprssion—of which h was conscious
without looking at hr—filld him with nchantmnt.
“Ar you rmaining in Moscow, thn?”
Pirr hsitatd.
“In Moscow?” h said in a qustioning ton. “Ys, in Moscow. Good-by!”
“Ah, if only I wr a man! I’d crtainly stay with you. How splndid!”
said Natásha. “Mamma, if you’ll lt m, I’ll stay!”
Pirr glancd absntly at Natásha and was about to say somthing, but
th countss intrruptd him.
“You wr at th battl, w hard.”
“Ys, I was,” Pirr answrd. “Thr will b anothr battl
tomorrow...” h bgan, but Natásha intrruptd him.
“But what is th mattr with you, Count? You ar not lik yourslf....”
“Oh, don’t ask m, don’t ask m! I don’t know myslf. Tomorrow... But
no! Good-by, good-by!” h muttrd. “It’s an awful tim!” and dropping
bhind th carriag h stppd onto th pavmnt.
Natásha continud to lan out of th window for a long tim, baming at
him with hr kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smil.
CHAPTR XVIII
For th last two days, vr sinc laving hom, Pirr had bn living
in th mpty hous of his dcasd bnfactor, Bazdv. This is how it
happnd.
Whn h wok up on th morning aftr his rturn to Moscow and his
intrviw with Count Rostopchín, h could not for som tim mak out
whr h was and what was xpctd of him. Whn h was informd that
among othrs awaiting him in his rcption room thr was a Frnchman
who had brought a lttr from his wif, th Countss Hlèn, h flt
suddnly ovrcom by that sns of confusion and hoplssnss to which
h was apt to succumb. H flt that vrything was now at an nd, all
was in confusion and crumbling to pics, that nobody was right or
wrong, th futur hld nothing, and thr was no scap from this
position. Smiling unnaturally and muttring to himslf, h first sat
down on th sofa in an attitud of dspair, thn ros, wnt to th door
of th rcption room and ppd through th crack, rturnd flourishing
his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo cam in a scond tim to
say that th Frnchman who had brought th lttr from th countss
was vry anxious to s him if only for a minut, and that somon from
Bazdv’s widow had calld to ask Pirr to tak charg of hr husband’s
books, as sh hrslf was laving for th country.
“Oh, ys, in a minut; wait... or no! No, of cours... go and say I will
com dirctly,” Pirr rplid to th major-domo.
But as soon as th man had lft th room Pirr took up his hat which
was lying on th tabl and wnt out of his study by th othr door.
Thr was no on in th passag. H wnt along th whol lngth of this
passag to th stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forhad with
both hands, wnt down as far as th first landing. Th hall portr was
standing at th front door. From th landing whr Pirr stood thr
was a scond staircas lading to th back ntranc. H wnt down that
staircas and out into th yard. No on had sn him. But thr wr
som carriags waiting, and as soon as Pirr stppd out of th gat
th coachmn and th yard portr noticd him and raisd thir caps to
him. Whn h flt h was bing lookd at h bhavd lik an ostrich
which hids its had in a bush in ordr not to b sn: h hung his had
and quickning his pac wnt down th strt.
Of all th affairs awaiting Pirr that day th sorting of Josph
Bazdv’s books and paprs appard to him th most ncssary.
H hird th first cab h mt and told th drivr to go to th
Patriarch’s Ponds, whr th widow Bazdv’s hous was.
Continually turning round to look at th rows of loadd carts that wr
making thir way from all sids out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky
body so as not to slip out of th ramshackl old vhicl, Pirr,
xprincing th joyful fling of a boy scaping from school, bgan to
talk to his drivr.
Th man told him that arms wr bing distributd today at th Krmlin
and that tomorrow vryon would b snt out byond th Thr Hills
gats and a grat battl would b fought thr.
Having rachd th Patriarch’s Ponds Pirr found th Bazdvs’ hous,
whr h had not bn for a long tim past. H wnt up to th gat.
Grásim, that sallow bardlss old man Pirr had sn at Torzhók fiv
yars bfor with Josph Bazdv, cam out in answr to his knock.
“At hom?” askd Pirr.
“Owing to th prsnt stat of things Sophia Danílovna has gon to th
Torzhók stat with th childrn, your xcllncy.”
“I will com in all th sam, I hav to look through th books,” said
Pirr.
“B so good as to stp in. Makár Alxvich, th brothr of my lat
mastr—may th kingdom of havn b his—has rmaind hr, but h is in
a wak stat as you know,” said th old srvant.
Pirr knw that Makár Alxvich was Josph Bazdv’s half-insan
brothr and a hard drinkr.
“Ys, ys, I know. Lt us go in...” said Pirr and ntrd th hous.
A tall, bald-hadd old man with a rd nos, waring a drssing gown and
with galoshs on his bar ft, stood in th antroom. On sing Pirr
h muttrd somthing angrily and wnt away along th passag.
“H was a vry clvr man but has now grown quit fbl, as your honor
ss,” said Grásim. “Will you stp into th study?” Pirr noddd. “As
it was sald up so it has rmaind, but Sophia Danílovna gav ordrs
that if anyon should com from you thy wr to hav th books.”
Pirr wnt into that gloomy study which h had ntrd with such
trpidation in his bnfactor’s liftim. Th room, dusty and untouchd
sinc th dath of Josph Bazdv was now vn gloomir.
Grásim opnd on of th shuttrs and lft th room on tipto. Pirr
wnt round th study, approachd th cupboard in which th manuscripts
wr kpt, and took out what had onc bn on of th most important,
th holy of holis of th ordr. This was th authntic Scotch Acts
with Bazdv’s nots and xplanations. H sat down at th dusty writing
tabl, and, having laid th manuscripts bfor him, opnd thm out,
closd thm, finally pushd thm away, and rsting his had on his hand
sank into mditation.
Grásim lookd cautiously into th study svral tims and saw Pirr
always sitting in th sam attitud.
Mor than two hours passd and Grásim took th librty of making a
slight nois at th door to attract his attntion, but Pirr did not
har him.
“Is th cabman to b dischargd, your honor?”
“Oh ys!” said Pirr, rousing himslf and rising hurridly. “Look
hr,” h addd, taking Grásim by a button of his coat and looking down
at th old man with moist, shining, and cstatic ys, “I say, do you
know that thr is going to b a battl tomorrow?”
“W hard so,” rplid th man.
“I bg you not to tll anyon who I am, and to do what I ask you.”
“Ys, your xcllncy,” rplid Grásim. “Will you hav somthing to
at?”
“No, but I want somthing ls. I want pasant cloths and a pistol,”
said Pirr, unxpctdly blushing.
“Ys, your xcllncy,” said Grásim aftr thinking for a momnt.
All th rst of that day Pirr spnt alon in his bnfactor’s study,
and Grásim hard him pacing rstlssly from on cornr to anothr and
talking to himslf. And h spnt th night on a bd mad up for him
thr.
Grásim, bing a srvant who in his tim had sn many strang things,
accptd Pirr’s taking up his rsidnc in th hous without surpris,
and smd plasd to hav somon to wait on. That sam vning—without
vn asking himslf what thy wr wantd for—h procurd a coachman’s
coat and cap for Pirr, and promisd to gt him th pistol nxt day.
Makár Alxvich cam twic that vning shuffling along in his galoshs
as far as th door and stoppd and lookd ingratiatingly at Pirr. But
as soon as Pirr turnd toward him h wrappd his drssing gown around
him with a shamfacd and angry look and hurrid away. It was whn
Pirr (waring th coachman’s coat which Grásim had procurd for him
and had disinfctd by stam) was on his way with th old man to buy th
pistol at th Súkharv markt that h mt th Rostóvs.
CHAPTR XIX
Kutúzov’s ordr to rtrat through Moscow to th Ryazán road was issud
at night on th first of Sptmbr.
Th first troops startd at onc, and during th night thy marchd
slowly and stadily without hurry. At daybrak, howvr, thos naring
th town at th Dorogomílov bridg saw ahad of thm masss of soldirs
crowding and hurrying across th bridg, ascnding on th opposit sid
and blocking th strts and allys, whil ndlss masss of troops wr
baring down on thm from bhind, and an unrasoning hurry and alarm
ovrcam thm. Thy all rushd forward to th bridg, onto it, and
to th fords and th boats. Kutúzov himslf had drivn round by sid
strts to th othr sid of Moscow.
By tn o’clock in th morning of th scond of Sptmbr, only th rar
guard rmaind in th Dorogomílov suburb, whr thy had ampl room. Th
main army was on th othr sid of Moscow or byond it.
At that vry tim, at tn in th morning of th scond of Sptmbr,
Napolon was standing among his troops on th Poklónny Hill looking at
th panorama sprad out bfor him. From th twnty-sixth of August
to th scond of Sptmbr, that is from th battl of Borodinó to th
ntry of th Frnch into Moscow, during th whol of that agitating,
mmorabl wk, thr had bn th xtraordinary autumn wathr that
always coms as a surpris, whn th sun hangs low and givs mor hat
than in spring, whn vrything shins so brightly in th rar clar
atmosphr that th ys smart, whn th lungs ar strngthnd and
rfrshd by inhaling th aromatic autumn air, whn vn th nights
ar warm, and whn in thos dark warm nights, goldn stars startl and
dlight us continually by falling from th sky.
At tn in th morning of th scond of Sptmbr this wathr still
hld.
Th brightnss of th morning was magical. Moscow sn from th Poklónny
Hill lay spaciously sprad out with hr rivr, hr gardns, and hr
churchs, and sh smd to b living hr usual lif, hr cupolas
glittring lik stars in th sunlight.
Th viw of th strang city with its pculiar architctur, such as
h had nvr sn bfor, filld Napolon with th rathr nvious and
unasy curiosity mn fl whn thy s an alin form of lif that has
no knowldg of thm. This city was vidntly living with th full forc
of its own lif. By th indfinit signs which, vn at a distanc,
distinguish a living body from a dad on, Napolon from th Poklónny
Hill prcivd th throb of lif in th town and flt, as it wr, th
brathing of that grat and bautiful body.
vry Russian looking at Moscow fls hr to b a mothr; vry
forignr who ss hr, vn if ignorant of hr significanc as th
mothr city, must fl hr fminin charactr, and Napolon flt it.
“Ctt vill asiatiqu aux innombrabls gliss, Moscou la saint. La
voilà donc nfin, ctt famus vill! Il tait tmps,” * said h, and
dismounting h ordrd a plan of Moscow to b sprad out bfor him, and
summond Llorgn d’Idvill, th intrprtr.
     * “That Asiatic city of th innumrabl churchs, holy
     Moscow! Hr it is thn at last, that famous city. It was
     high tim.”
“A town capturd by th nmy is lik a maid who has lost hr honor,”
thought h (h had said so to Túchkov at Smolnsk). From that point of
viw h gazd at th Orintal bauty h had not sn bfor. It smd
strang to him that his long-flt wish, which had smd unattainabl,
had at last bn ralizd. In th clar morning light h gazd now at
th city and now at th plan, considring its dtails, and th assuranc
of possssing it agitatd and awd him.
“But could it b othrwis?” h thought. “Hr is this capital at my
ft. Whr is Alxandr now, and of what is h thinking? A strang,
bautiful, and majstic city; and a strang and majstic momnt! In what
light must I appar to thm!” thought h, thinking of his troops.
“Hr sh is, th rward for all thos fainthartd mn,” h rflctd,
glancing at thos nar him and at th troops who wr approaching and
forming up. “On word from m, on movmnt of my hand, and that ancint
capital of th Tsars would prish. But my clmncy is always rady to
dscnd upon th vanquishd. I must b magnanimous and truly grat. But
no, it can’t b tru that I am in Moscow,” h suddnly thought.
“Yt hr sh is lying at my ft, with hr goldn doms and crosss
scintillating and twinkling in th sunshin. But I shall spar hr. On
th ancint monumnts of barbarism and dspotism I will inscrib grat
words of justic and mrcy.... It is just this which Alxandr will
fl most painfully, I know him.” (It smd to Napolon that th chif
import of what was taking plac lay in th prsonal struggl btwn
himslf and Alxandr.) “From th hight of th Krmlin—ys, thr
is th Krmlin, ys—I will giv thm just laws; I will tach thm th
maning of tru civilization, I will mak gnrations of boyars rmmbr
thir conquror with lov. I will tll th dputation that I did not,
and do not, dsir war, that I hav wagd war only against th fals
policy of thir court; that I lov and rspct Alxandr and that in
Moscow I will accpt trms of pac worthy of myslf and of my popl.
I do not wish to utiliz th fortuns of war to humiliat an honord
monarch. ‘Boyars,’ I will say to thm, ‘I do not dsir war, I dsir
th pac and wlfar of all my subjcts.’ Howvr, I know thir
prsnc will inspir m, and I shall spak to thm as I always do:
clarly, imprssivly, and majstically. But can it b tru that I am in
Moscow? Ys, thr sh lis.”
“Qu’on m’amèn ls boyars,” * said h to his suit.
    * “Bring th boyars to m.”
A gnral with a brilliant suit gallopd off at onc to ftch th
boyars.
Two hours passd. Napolon had lunchd and was again standing in th
sam plac on th Poklónny Hill awaiting th dputation. His spch to
th boyars had alrady takn dfinit shap in his imagination. That
spch was full of dignity and gratnss as Napolon undrstood it.
H was himslf carrid away by th ton of magnanimity h intndd to
adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination h appointd days for assmblis
at th palac of th Tsars, at which Russian notabls and his own would
mingl. H mntally appointd a govrnor, on who would win th
harts of th popl. Having larnd that thr wr many charitabl
institutions in Moscow h mntally dcidd that h would showr favors
on thm all. H thought that, as in Africa h had to put on a burnoos
and sit in a mosqu, so in Moscow h must b bnficnt lik th Tsars.
And in ordr finally to touch th harts of th Russians—and bing lik
all Frnchmn unabl to imagin anything sntimntal without a rfrnc
to ma chèr, ma tndr, ma pauvr mèr * —h dcidd that h would
plac an inscription on all ths stablishmnts in larg lttrs:
“This stablishmnt is ddicatd to my dar mothr.” Or no, it should
b simply: Maison d ma Mèr, *(2) h concludd. “But am I rally in
Moscow? Ys, hr it lis bfor m, but why is th dputation from th
city so long in apparing?” h wondrd.
     * “My dar, my tndr, my poor mothr.”
     * (2) “Hous of my Mothr.”
Manwhil an agitatd consultation was bing carrid on in whisprs
among his gnrals and marshals at th rar of his suit. Thos snt to
ftch th dputation had rturnd with th nws that Moscow was mpty,
that vryon had lft it. Th facs of thos who wr not confrring
togthr wr pal and prturbd. Thy wr not alarmd by th fact
that Moscow had bn abandond by its inhabitants (grav as that fact
smd), but by th qustion how to tll th mpror—without putting
him in th trribl position of apparing ridiculous—that h had bn
awaiting th boyars so long in vain: that thr wr drunkn mobs lft
in Moscow but no on ls. Som said that a dputation of som sort must
b scrapd togthr, othrs disputd that opinion and maintaind that
th mpror should first b carfully and skillfully prpard, and thn
told th truth.
“H will hav to b told, all th sam,” said som gntlmn of th
suit. “But, gntlmn...”
Th position was th mor awkward bcaus th mpror, mditating upon
his magnanimous plans, was pacing patintly up and down bfor th
outsprad map, occasionally glancing along th road to Moscow from undr
his liftd hand with a bright and proud smil.
“But it’s impossibl...” dclard th gntlmn of th suit, shrugging
thir shouldrs but not vnturing to uttr th implid word—l
ridicul....
At last th mpror, tird of futil xpctation, his actor’s instinct
suggsting to him that th sublim momnt having bn too long drawn out
was bginning to los its sublimity, gav a sign with his hand. A singl
rport of a signaling gun followd, and th troops, who wr alrady
sprad out on diffrnt sids of Moscow, movd into th city through th
Tvr, Kalúga, and Dorogomílov gats. Fastr and fastr, vying with
on anothr, thy movd at th doubl or at a trot, vanishing amid th
clouds of dust thy raisd and making th air ring with a dafning roar
of mingling shouts.
Drawn on by th movmnt of his troops Napolon rod with thm as far as
th Dorogomílov gat, but thr again stoppd and, dismounting from his
hors, pacd for a long tim by th Kámmr-Kollzski rampart, awaiting
th dputation.
CHAPTR XX
Manwhil Moscow was mpty. Thr wr still popl in it, prhaps a
fiftith part of its formr inhabitants had rmaind, but it was mpty.
It was mpty in th sns that a dying qunlss hiv is mpty.
In a qunlss hiv no lif is lft though to a suprficial glanc it
sms as much aliv as othr hivs.
Th bs circl round a qunlss hiv in th hot bams of th midday
sun as gaily as around th living hivs; from a distanc it smlls of
hony lik th othrs, and bs fly in and out in th sam way. But on
has only to obsrv that hiv to raliz that thr is no longr any
lif in it. Th bs do not fly in th sam way, th smll and th sound
that mt th bkpr ar not th sam. To th bkpr’s tap on th
wall of th sick hiv, instad of th formr instant unanimous
humming of tns of thousands of bs with thir abdomns thratningly
comprssd, and producing by th rapid vibration of thir wings an
arial living sound, th only rply is a disconnctd buzzing from
diffrnt parts of th dsrtd hiv. From th alighting board, instad
of th formr spirituous fragrant smll of hony and vnom, and th warm
whiffs of crowdd lif, coms an odor of mptinss and dcay mingling
with th smll of hony. Thr ar no longr sntinls sounding th
alarm with thir abdomns raisd, and rady to di in dfns of th
hiv. Thr is no longr th masurd quit sound of throbbing activity,
lik th sound of boiling watr, but divrs discordant sounds of
disordr. In and out of th hiv long black robbr bs smard with
hony fly timidly and shiftily. Thy do not sting, but crawl away from
dangr. Formrly only bs ladn with hony flw into th hiv, and thy
flw out mpty; now thy fly out ladn. Th bkpr opns th lowr
part of th hiv and prs in. Instad of black, glossy bs—tamd by
toil, clinging to on anothr’s lgs and drawing out th wax, with a
caslss hum of labor—that usd to hang in long clustrs down to th
floor of th hiv, drowsy shrivld bs crawl about sparatly in
various dirctions on th floor and walls of th hiv. Instad of a
natly glud floor, swpt by th bs with th fanning of thir wings,
thr is a floor littrd with bits of wax, xcrmnt, dying bs
scarcly moving thir lgs, and dad ons that hav not bn clard
away.
Th bkpr opns th uppr part of th hiv and xamins th supr.
Instad of srrid rows of bs saling up vry gap in th combs and
kping th brood warm, h ss th skillful complx structurs of th
combs, but no longr in thir formr stat of purity. All is nglctd
and foul. Black robbr bs ar swiftly and stalthily prowling about
th combs, and th short hom bs, shrivld and listlss as if thy
wr old, crp slowly about without trying to hindr th robbrs,
having lost all motiv and all sns of lif. Drons, bumblbs, wasps,
and buttrflis knock awkwardly against th walls of th hiv in thir
flight. Hr and thr among th clls containing dad brood and hony
an angry buzzing can somtims b hard. Hr and thr a coupl of
bs, by forc of habit and custom claning out th brood clls, with
fforts byond thir strngth laboriously drag away a dad b or
bumblb without knowing why thy do it. In anothr cornr two old bs
ar languidly fighting, or claning thmslvs, or fding on anothr,
without thmslvs knowing whthr thy do it with frindly or hostil
intnt. In a third plac a crowd of bs, crushing on anothr, attack
som victim and fight and smothr it, and th victim, nfbld or
killd, drops from abov slowly and lightly as a fathr, among th hap
of corpss. Th kpr opns th two cntr partitions to xamin
th brood clls. In plac of th formr clos dark circls formd by
thousands of bs sitting back to back and guarding th high mystry
of gnration, h ss hundrds of dull, listlss, and slpy shlls of
bs. Thy hav almost all did unawars, sitting in th sanctuary thy
had guardd and which is now no mor. Thy rk of dcay and dath. Only
a fw of thm still mov, ris, and fbly fly to sttl on th nmy’s
hand, lacking th spirit to di stinging him; th rst ar dad and fall
as lightly as fish scals. Th bkpr closs th hiv, chalks a mark
on it, and whn h has tim tars out its contnts and burns it clan.
So in th sam way Moscow was mpty whn Napolon, wary, unasy, and
moros, pacd up and down in front of th Kámmr-Kollzski rampart,
awaiting what to his mind was a ncssary, if but formal, obsrvanc of
th propritis—a dputation.
In various cornrs of Moscow thr still rmaind a fw popl aimlssly
moving about, following thir old habits and hardly awar of what thy
wr doing.
Whn with du circumspction Napolon was informd that Moscow was
mpty, h lookd angrily at his informant, turnd away, and silntly
continud to walk to and fro.
“My carriag!” h said.
H took his sat bsid th aid-d-camp on duty and drov into th
suburb. “Moscow dsrtd!” h said to himslf. “What an incrdibl
vnt!”
H did not driv into th town, but put up at an inn in th Dorogomílov
suburb.
Th coup d thâtr had not com off.
CHAPTR XXI
Th Russian troops wr passing through Moscow from two o’clock at night
till two in th aftrnoon and bor away with thm th woundd and th
last of th inhabitants who wr laving.
Th gratst crush during th movmnt of th troops took plac at th
Ston, Moskvá, and Yaúza bridgs.
Whil th troops, dividing into two parts whn passing around th
Krmlin, wr thronging th Moskvá and th Ston bridgs, a grat many
soldirs, taking advantag of th stoppag and congstion, turnd back
from th bridgs and slippd stalthily and silntly past th church of
Vasíli th Batifid and undr th Borovítski gat, back up th hill
to th Rd Squar whr som instinct told thm thy could asily tak
things not blonging to thm. Crowds of th kind sn at chap sals
filld all th passags and allys of th Bazaar. But thr wr no
dalrs with voics of ingratiating affability inviting customrs to
ntr; thr wr no hawkrs, nor th usual motly crowd of fmal
purchasrs—but only soldirs, in uniforms and ovrcoats though without
muskts, ntring th Bazaar mpty-handd and silntly making thir way
out through its passags with bundls. Tradsmn and thir assistants
(of whom thr wr but fw) movd about among th soldirs quit
bwildrd. Thy unlockd thir shops and lockd thm up again, and
thmslvs carrid goods away with th hlp of thir assistants. On th
squar in front of th Bazaar wr drummrs bating th mustr call.
But th roll of th drums did not mak th looting soldirs run in th
dirction of th drum as formrly, but mad thm, on th contrary, run
farthr away. Among th soldirs in th shops and passags som mn wr
to b sn in gray coats, with closly shavn hads. Two officrs, on
with a scarf ovr his uniform and mountd on a lan, dark-gray hors,
th othr in an ovrcoat and on foot, stood at th cornr of Ilyínka
Strt, talking. A third officr gallopd up to thm.
“Th gnral ordrs thm all to b drivn out at onc, without fail.
This is outragous! Half th mn hav disprsd.”
“Whr ar you off to?... Whr?...” h shoutd to thr infantrymn
without muskts who, holding up th skirts of thir ovrcoats, wr
slipping past him into th Bazaar passag. “Stop, you rascals!”
“But how ar you going to stop thm?” rplid anothr officr. “Thr is
no gtting thm togthr. Th army should push on bfor th rst bolt,
that’s all!”
“How can on push on? Thy ar stuck thr, wdgd on th bridg, and
don’t mov. Shouldn’t w put a cordon round to prvnt th rst from
running away?”
“Com, go in thr and driv thm out!” shoutd th snior officr.
Th officr in th scarf dismountd, calld up a drummr, and wnt with
him into th arcad. Som soldirs startd running away in a group. A
shopkpr with rd pimpls on his chks nar th nos, and a calm,
prsistnt, calculating xprssion on his plump fac, hurridly and
ostntatiously approachd th officr, swinging his arms.
“Your honor!” said h. “B so good as to protct us! W won’t grudg
trifls, you ar wlcom to anything—w shall b dlightd! Pray!...
I’ll ftch a pic of cloth at onc for such an honorabl gntlman,
or vn two pics with plasur. For w fl how it is; but what’s all
this—shr robbry! If you plas, could not guards b placd if only to
lt us clos th shop....”
Svral shopkprs crowdd round th officr.
“h, what twaddl!” said on of thm, a thin, strn-looking man. “Whn
on’s had is gon on dosn’t wp for on’s hair! Tak what any of you
lik!” And flourishing his arm nrgtically h turnd sidways to th
officr.
“It’s all vry wll for you, Iván Sidórych, to talk,” said th first
tradsman angrily. “Plas stp insid, your honor!”
“Talk indd!” crid th thin on. “In my thr shops hr I hav a
hundrd thousand rubls’ worth of goods. Can thy b savd whn th army
has gon? h, what popl! ‘Against God’s might our hands can’t fight.’”
“Com insid, your honor!” rpatd th tradsman, bowing.
Th officr stood prplxd and his fac showd indcision.
“It’s not my businss!” h xclaimd, and strod on quickly down on of
th passags.
From on opn shop cam th sound of blows and vitupration, and just
as th officr cam up to it a man in a gray coat with a shavn had was
flung out violntly.
This man, bnt doubl, rushd past th tradsman and th officr. Th
officr pouncd on th soldirs who wr in th shops, but at that
momnt farful scrams rachd thm from th hug crowd on th Moskvá
bridg and th officr ran out into th squar.
“What is it? What is it?” h askd, but his comrad was alrady
galloping off past Vasíli th Batifid in th dirction from which th
scrams cam.
Th officr mountd his hors and rod aftr him. Whn h rachd th
bridg h saw two unlimbrd guns, th infantry crossing th bridg,
svral ovrturnd carts, and frightnd and laughing facs among th
troops. Bsid th cannon a cart was standing to which two horss wr
harnssd. Four borzois with collars wr prssing clos to th whls.
Th cart was loadd high, and at th vry top, bsid a child’s chair
with its lgs in th air, sat a pasant woman uttring pircing and
dsprat shriks. H was told by his fllow officrs that th scrams
of th crowd and th shriks of th woman wr du to th fact that
Gnral rmólov, coming up to th crowd and larning that soldirs wr
disprsing among th shops whil crowds of civilians blockd th bridg,
had ordrd two guns to b unlimbrd and mad a show of firing at th
bridg. Th crowd, crushing on anothr, upstting carts, and shouting
and squzing dspratly, had clard off th bridg and th troops
wr now moving forward.
CHAPTR XXII
Manwhil, th city itslf was dsrtd. Thr was hardly anyon in th
strts. Th gats and shops wr all closd, only hr and thr round
th tavrns solitary shouts or drunkn songs could b hard. Nobody
drov through th strts and footstps wr rarly hard. Th
Povarskáya was quit still and dsrtd. Th hug courtyard of th
Rostóvs’ hous was littrd with wisps of hay and with dung from th
horss, and not a soul was to b sn thr. In th grat drawing
room of th hous, which had bn lft with all it containd, wr
two popl. Thy wr th yard portr Ignát, and th pag boy Míshka,
Vasílich’s grandson who had stayd in Moscow with his grandfathr.
Míshka had opnd th clavichord and was strumming on it with
on fingr. Th yard portr, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with
satisfaction bfor th larg mirror.
“Isn’t it fin, h, Uncl Ignát?” said th boy, suddnly bginning to
strik th kyboard with both hands.
“Only fancy!” answrd Ignát, surprisd at th broadning grin on his
fac in th mirror.
“Impudnc! Impudnc!” thy hard bhind thm th voic of Mávra
Kuzmínichna who had ntrd silntly. “How h’s grinning, th fat mug!
Is that what you’r hr for? Nothing’s clard away down thr and
Vasílich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!”
Ignát lft off smiling, adjustd his blt, and wnt out of th room with
mkly downcast ys.
“Aunt, I did it gntly,” said th boy.
“I’ll giv you somthing gntly, you monky you!” crid Mávra
Kuzmínichna, raising hr arm thratningly. “Go and gt th samovar to
boil for your grandfathr.”
Mávra Kuzmínichna flickd th dust off th clavichord and closd it, and
with a dp sigh lft th drawing room and lockd its main door.
Going out into th yard sh pausd to considr whr sh should go
nxt—to drink ta in th srvants’ wing with Vasílich, or into th
storroom to put away what still lay about.
Sh hard th sound of quick footstps in th quit strt. Somon
stoppd at th gat, and th latch rattld as somon trid to opn it.
Mávra Kuzmínichna wnt to th gat.
“Who do you want?”
“Th count—Count Ilyá Andrvich Rostóv.”
“And who ar you?”
“An officr, I hav to s him,” cam th rply in a plasant, wll-brd
Russian voic.
Mávra Kuzmínichna opnd th gat and an officr of ightn, with th
round fac of a Rostóv, ntrd th yard.
“Thy hav gon away, sir. Wnt away ystrday at vsprtim,” said
Mávra Kuzmínichna cordially.
Th young officr standing in th gatway, as if hsitating whthr to
ntr or not, clickd his tongu.
“Ah, how annoying!” h muttrd. “I should hav com ystrday.... Ah,
what a pity.”
Manwhil, Mávra Kuzmínichna was attntivly and sympathtically
xamining th familiar Rostóv faturs of th young man’s fac, his
tattrd coat and troddn-down boots.
“What did you want to s th count for?” sh askd.
“Oh wll... it can’t b hlpd!” said h in a ton of vxation and
placd his hand on th gat as if to lav.
H again pausd in indcision.
“You s,” h suddnly said, “I am a kinsman of th count’s and h has
bn vry kind to m. As you s” (h glancd with an amusd air and
good-naturd smil at his coat and boots) “my things ar worn out and I
hav no mony, so I was going to ask th count...”
Mávra Kuzmínichna did not lt him finish.
“Just wait a minut, sir. On littl momnt,” said sh.
And as soon as th officr lt go of th gat handl sh turnd and,
hurrying away on hr old lgs, wnt through th back yard to th
srvants’ quartrs.
Whil Mávra Kuzmínichna was running to hr room th officr walkd about
th yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowrd had and a faint
smil on his lips. “What a pity I’v missd Uncl! What a nic old
woman! Whr has sh run off to? And how am I to find th narst way
to ovrtak my rgimnt, which must by now b gtting nar th Rogózhski
gat?” thought h. Just thn Mávra Kuzmínichna appard from bhind
th cornr of th hous with a frightnd yt rsolut look, carrying a
rolld-up chck krchif in hr hand. Whil still a fw stps from
th officr sh unfoldd th krchif and took out of it a whit
twnty-fiv-rubl assignat and hastily handd it to him.
“If his xcllncy had bn at hom, as a kinsman h would of cours...
but as it is...”
Mávra Kuzmínichna grw abashd and confusd. Th officr did not
dclin, but took th not quitly and thankd hr.
“If th count had bn at hom...” Mávra Kuzmínichna wnt on
apologtically. “Christ b with you, sir! May God prsrv you!” said
sh, bowing as sh saw him out.
Swaying his had and smiling as if amusd at himslf, th officr ran
almost at a trot through th dsrtd strts toward th Yaúza bridg to
ovrtak his rgimnt.
But Mávra Kuzmínichna stood at th closd gat for som tim with moist
ys, pnsivly swaying hr had and fling an unxpctd flow of
mothrly tndrnss and pity for th unknown young officr.
CHAPTR XXIII
From an unfinishd hous on th Varvárka, th ground floor of which was
a dramshop, cam drunkn shouts and songs. On bnchs round th tabls
in a dirty littl room sat som tn factory hands. Tipsy and prspiring,
with dim ys and wid-opn mouths, thy wr all laboriously singing
som song or othr. Thy wr singing discordantly, arduously, and with
grat ffort, vidntly not bcaus thy wishd to sing, but bcaus
thy wantd to show thy wr drunk and on a spr. On, a tall,
fair-haird lad in a clan blu coat, was standing ovr th othrs. His
fac with its fin straight nos would hav bn handsom had it not
bn for his thin, comprssd, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixd
ys. vidntly possssd by som ida, h stood ovr thos who wr
singing, and solmnly and jrkily flourishd abov thir hads his whit
arm with th slv turnd up to th lbow, trying unnaturally to sprad
out his dirty fingrs. Th slv of his coat kpt slipping down and h
always carfully rolld it up again with his lft hand, as if it wr
most important that th sinwy whit arm h was flourishing should b
bar. In th midst of th song cris wr hard, and fighting and blows
in th passag and porch. Th tall lad wavd his arm.
“Stop it!” h xclaimd prmptorily. “Thr’s a fight, lads!” And,
still rolling up his slv, h wnt out to th porch.
Th factory hands followd him. Ths mn, who undr th ladrship of
th tall lad wr drinking in th dramshop that morning, had brought th
publican som skins from th factory and for this had had drink srvd
thm. Th blacksmiths from a nighboring smithy, haring th sounds of
rvlry in th tavrn and supposing it to hav bn brokn into, wishd
to forc thir way in too and a fight in th porch had rsultd.
Th publican was fighting on of th smiths at th door, and whn th
workmn cam out th smith, wrnching himslf fr from th tavrn
kpr, fll fac downward on th pavmnt.
Anothr smith trid to ntr th doorway, prssing against th publican
with his chst.
Th lad with th turnd-up slv gav th smith a blow in th fac and
crid wildly: “Thy’r fighting us, lads!”
At that momnt th first smith got up and, scratching his bruisd
fac to mak it bld, shoutd in a tarful voic: “Polic! Murdr!...
Thy’v killd a man, lads!”
“Oh, gracious m, a man batn to dath—killd!...” scramd a woman
coming out of a gat clos by.
A crowd gathrd round th bloodstaind smith.
“Havn’t you robbd popl nough—taking thir last shirts?” said a
voic addrssing th publican. “What hav you killd a man for, you
thif?”
Th tall lad, standing in th porch, turnd his blard ys from th
publican to th smith and back again as if considring whom h ought to
fight now.
“Murdrr!” h shoutd suddnly to th publican. “Bind him, lads!”
“I darsay you would lik to bind m!” shoutd th publican, pushing
away th mn advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his had h
flung it on th ground.
As if this action had som mystrious and mnacing significanc, th
workmn surrounding th publican pausd in indcision.
“I know th law vry wll, mats! I’ll tak th mattr to th captain
of polic. You think I won’t gt to him? Robbry is not prmittd to
anybody nowadays!” shoutd th publican, picking up his cap.
“Com along thn! Com along thn!” th publican and th tall young
fllow rpatd on aftr th othr, and thy movd up th strt
togthr.
Th bloodstaind smith wnt bsid thm. Th factory hands and othrs
followd bhind, talking and shouting.
At th cornr of th Morosyka, opposit a larg hous with closd
shuttrs and baring a bootmakr’s signboard, stood a scor of thin,
worn-out, gloomy-facd bootmakrs, waring ovralls and long tattrd
coats.
“H should pay folks off proprly,” a thin workingman, with frowning
brows and a straggly bard, was saying.
“But h’s suckd our blood and now h thinks h’s quit of us. H’s bn
mislading us all th wk and now that h’s brought us to this pass
h’s mad off.”
On sing th crowd and th bloodstaind man th workman casd
spaking, and with agr curiosity all th bootmakrs joind th moving
crowd.
“Whr ar all th folks going?”
“Why, to th polic, of cours!”
“I say, is it tru that w hav bn batn?” “And what did you think?
Look what folks ar saying.”
Qustions and answrs wr hard. Th publican, taking advantag of th
incrasd crowd, droppd bhind and rturnd to his tavrn.
Th tall youth, not noticing th disapparanc of his fo, wavd his
bar arm and wnt on talking incssantly, attracting gnral attntion
to himslf. It was around him that th popl chifly crowdd, xpcting
answrs from him to th qustions that occupid all thir minds.
“H must kp ordr, kp th law, that’s what th govrnmnt is thr
for. Am I not right, good Christians?” said th tall youth, with a
scarcly prcptibl smil. “H thinks thr’s no govrnmnt! How can
on do without govrnmnt? Or ls thr would b plnty who’d rob us.”
“Why talk nonsns?” rjoind voics in th crowd. “Will thy giv
up Moscow lik this? Thy told you that for fun, and you blivd it!
Arn’t thr plnty of troops on th march? Lt him in, indd! That’s
what th govrnmnt is for. You’d bttr listn to what popl ar
saying,” said som of th mob pointing to th tall youth.
By th wall of China-Town a smallr group of popl wr gathrd round
a man in a friz coat who hld a papr in his hand.
“An ukás, thy ar rading an ukás! Rading an ukás!” crid voics in
th crowd, and th popl rushd toward th radr.
Th man in th friz coat was rading th broadsht of August 31. Whn
th crowd collctd round him h smd confusd, but at th dmand
of th tall lad who had pushd his way up to him, h bgan in a rathr
trmulous voic to rad th sht from th bginning.
“arly tomorrow I shall go to his Srn Highnss,” h rad (“Sirin
Highnss,” said th tall fllow with a triumphant smil on his lips and
a frown on his brow), “to consult with him to act, and to aid th army
to xtrminat ths scoundrls. W too will tak part...” th radr
wnt on, and thn pausd (“Do you s,” shoutd th youth victoriously,
“h’s going to clar up th whol affair for you....”), “in dstroying
thm, and will snd ths visitors to th dvil. I will com back to
dinnr, and w’ll st to work. W will do, compltly do, and undo ths
scoundrls.”
Th last words wr rad out in th midst of complt silnc. Th tall
lad hung his had gloomily. It was vidnt that no on had undrstood
th last part. In particular, th words “I will com back to dinnr,”
vidntly displasd both radr and audinc. Th popl’s minds
wr tund to a high pitch and this was too simpl and ndlssly
comprhnsibl—it was what anyon of thm might hav said and thrfor
was what an ukás manating from th highst authority should not say.
Thy all stood dspondnt and silnt. Th tall youth movd his lips and
swayd from sid to sid.
“W should ask him... that’s h himslf?”... “Ys, ask him indd!...
Why not? H’ll xplain”... voics in th rar of th crowd wr
suddnly hard saying, and th gnral attntion turnd to th polic
suprintndnt’s trap which drov into th squar attndd by two
mountd dragoons.
Th suprintndnt of polic, who had gon that morning by Count
Rostopchín’s ordrs to burn th bargs and had in connction with that
mattr acquird a larg sum of mony which was at that momnt in his
pockt, on sing a crowd baring down upon him told his coachman to
stop.
“What popl ar ths?” h shoutd to th mn, who wr moving singly
and timidly in th dirction of his trap.
“What popl ar ths?” h shoutd again, rciving no answr.
“Your honor...” rplid th shopman in th friz coat, “your honor, in
accord with th proclamation of his highst xcllncy th count, thy
dsir to srv, not sparing thir livs, and it is not any kind of
riot, but as his highst xcllnc said...”
“Th count has not lft, h is hr, and an ordr will b issud
concrning you,” said th suprintndnt of polic. “Go on!” h ordrd
his coachman.
Th crowd haltd, prssing around thos who had hard what th
suprintndnt had said, and looking at th dparting trap.
Th suprintndnt of polic turnd round at that momnt with a scard
look, said somthing to his coachman, and his horss incrasd thir
spd.
“It’s a fraud, lads! Lad th way to him, himslf!” shoutd th tall
youth. “Don’t lt him go, lads! Lt him answr us! Kp him!” shoutd
diffrnt popl and th popl dashd in pursuit of th trap.
Following th suprintndnt of polic and talking loudly th crowd wnt
in th dirction of th Lubyánka Strt.
“Thr now, th gntry and mrchants hav gon away and lft us to
prish. Do thy think w’r dogs?” voics in th crowd wr hard saying
mor and mor frquntly.
CHAPTR XXIV
On th vning of th first of Sptmbr, aftr his intrviw with
Kutúzov, Count Rostopchín had rturnd to Moscow mortifid and offndd
bcaus h had not bn invitd to attnd th council of war, and
bcaus Kutúzov had paid no attntion to his offr to tak part in th
dfns of th city; amazd also at th novl outlook rvald to him
at th camp, which tratd th tranquillity of th capital and its
patriotic frvor as not mrly scondary but quit irrlvant and
unimportant mattrs. Distrssd, offndd, and surprisd by all this,
Rostopchín had rturnd to Moscow. Aftr suppr h lay down on a sofa
without undrssing, and was awaknd soon aftr midnight by a courir
bringing him a lttr from Kutúzov. This lttr rqustd th count to
snd polic officrs to guid th troops through th town, as th army
was rtrating to th Ryazán road byond Moscow. This was not nws to
Rostopchín. H had known that Moscow would b abandond not mrly sinc
his intrviw th prvious day with Kutúzov on th Poklónny Hill but
vr sinc th battl of Borodinó, for all th gnrals who cam to
Moscow aftr that battl had said unanimously that it was impossibl to
fight anothr battl, and sinc thn th govrnmnt proprty had bn
rmovd vry night, and half th inhabitants had lft th city
with Rostopchín’s own prmission. Yt all th sam this information
astonishd and irritatd th count, coming as it did in th form of a
simpl not with an ordr from Kutúzov, and rcivd at night, braking
in on his bauty slp.
Whn latr on in his mmoirs Count Rostopchín xplaind his actions at
this tim, h rpatdly says that h was thn actuatd by two important
considrations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and xpdit th
dpartur of th inhabitants. If on accpts this twofold aim all
Rostopchín’s actions appar irrproachabl. “Why wr th holy rlics,
th arms, ammunition, gunpowdr, and stors of corn not rmovd? Why
wr thousands of inhabitants dcivd into bliving that Moscow would
not b givn up—and thrby ruind?” “To prsrv th tranquillity
of th city,” xplains Count Rostopchín. “Why wr bundls of uslss
paprs from th govrnmnt offics, and Lppich’s balloon and othr
articls rmovd?” “To lav th town mpty,” xplains Count Rostopchín.
On nd only admit that public tranquillity is in dangr and any action
finds a justification.
All th horrors of th rign of trror wr basd only on solicitud for
public tranquillity.
On what, thn, was Count Rostopchín’s far for th tranquillity of
Moscow basd in 1812? What rason was thr for assuming any probability
of an uprising in th city? Th inhabitants wr laving it and th
rtrating troops wr filling it. Why should that caus th masss to
riot?
Nithr in Moscow nor anywhr in Russia did anything rsmbling an
insurrction vr occur whn th nmy ntrd a town. Mor than
tn thousand popl wr still in Moscow on th first and scond of
Sptmbr, and xcpt for a mob in th govrnor’s courtyard, assmbld
thr at his bidding, nothing happnd. It is obvious that thr would
hav bn vn lss rason to xpct a disturbanc among th popl
if aftr th battl of Borodinó, whn th surrndr of Moscow bcam
crtain or at last probabl, Rostopchín instad of xciting th popl
by distributing arms and broadshts had takn stps to rmov all
th holy rlics, th gunpowdr, munitions, and mony, and had told th
population plainly that th town would b abandond.
Rostopchín, though h had patriotic sntimnts, was a sanguin and
impulsiv man who had always movd in th highst administrativ circls
and had no undrstanding at all of th popl h supposd himslf to
b guiding. vr sinc th nmy’s ntry into Smolnsk h had in
imagination bn playing th rol of dirctor of th popular fling
of “th hart of Russia.” Not only did it sm to him (as to all
administrators) that h controlld th xtrnal actions of Moscow’s
inhabitants, but h also thought h controlld thir mntal attitud by
mans of his broadshts and postrs, writtn in a coars ton which th
popl dspis in thir own class and do not undrstand from thos in
authority. Rostopchín was so plasd with th fin rol of ladr of
popular fling, and had grown so usd to it, that th ncssity of
rlinquishing that rol and abandoning Moscow without any hroic display
took him unawars and h suddnly flt th ground slip away from undr
his ft, so that h positivly did not know what to do. Though h knw
it was coming, h did not till th last momnt wholhartdly bliv
that Moscow would b abandond, and did not prpar for it. Th
inhabitants lft against his wishs. If th govrnmnt offics wr
rmovd, this was only don on th dmand of officials to whom th count
yildd rluctantly. H was absorbd in th rol h had cratd
for himslf. As is oftn th cas with thos giftd with an ardnt
imagination, though h had long known that Moscow would b abandond h
knw it only with his intllct, h did not bliv it in his hart and
did not adapt himslf mntally to this nw position of affairs.
All his painstaking and nrgtic activity (in how far it was usful
and had any ffct on th popl is anothr qustion) had bn simply
dirctd toward arousing in th masss his own fling of patriotic
hatrd of th Frnch.
But whn vnts assumd thir tru historical charactr, whn xprssing
hatrd for th Frnch in words provd insufficint, whn it was not
vn possibl to xprss that hatrd by fighting a battl, whn
slf-confidnc was of no avail in rlation to th on qustion bfor
Moscow, whn th whol population stramd out of Moscow as on man,
abandoning thir blongings and proving by that ngativ action all
th dpth of thir national fling, thn th rol chosn by Rostopchín
suddnly appard snslss. H unxpctdly flt himslf ridiculous,
wak, and alon, with no ground to stand on.
Whn, awaknd from his slp, h rcivd that cold, prmptory not
from Kutúzov, h flt th mor irritatd th mor h flt himslf
to blam. All that h had bn spcially put in charg of, th stat
proprty which h should hav rmovd, was still in Moscow and it was no
longr possibl to tak th whol of it away.
“Who is to blam for it? Who has lt things com to such a pass?” h
ruminatd. “Not I, of cours. I had vrything rady. I had Moscow
firmly in hand. And this is what thy hav lt it com to! Villains!
Traitors!” h thought, without clarly dfining who th villains and
traitors wr, but fling it ncssary to hat thos traitors whovr
thy might b who wr to blam for th fals and ridiculous position in
which h found himslf.
All that night Count Rostopchín issud ordrs, for which popl cam to
him from all parts of Moscow. Thos about him had nvr sn th count
so moros and irritabl.
“Your xcllncy, th Dirctor of th Rgistrar’s Dpartmnt has snt
for instructions.... From th Consistory, from th Snat, from th
Univrsity, from th Foundling Hospital, th Suffragan has snt...
asking for information.... What ar your ordrs about th Fir Brigad?
From th govrnor of th prison... from th suprintndnt of th
lunatic asylum...” All night long such announcmnts wr continually
bing rcivd by th count.
To all ths inquiris h gav brif and angry rplis indicating that
ordrs from him wr not now ndd, that th whol affair, carfully
prpard by him, had now bn ruind by sombody, and that that sombody
would hav to bar th whol rsponsibility for all that might happn.
“Oh, tll that blockhad,” h said in rply to th qustion from th
Rgistrar’s Dpartmnt, “that h should rmain to guard his documnts.
Now why ar you asking silly qustions about th Fir Brigad? Thy hav
horss, lt thm b off to Vladímir, and not lav thm to th Frnch.”
“Your xcllncy, th suprintndnt of th lunatic asylum has com:
what ar your commands?”
“My commands? Lt thm go away, that’s all.... And lt th lunatics
out into th town. Whn lunatics command our armis God vidntly mans
ths othr madmn to b fr.”
In rply to an inquiry about th convicts in th prison, Count
Rostopchín shoutd angrily at th govrnor:
“Do you xpct m to giv you two battalions—which w hav not got—for a
convoy? Rlas thm, that’s all about it!”
“Your xcllncy, thr ar som political prisonrs, Mshkóv,
Vrshchágin...”
“Vrshchágin! Hasn’t h bn hangd yt?” shoutd Rostopchín. “Bring
him to m!”
CHAPTR XXV
Toward nin o’clock in th morning, whn th troops wr alrady moving
through Moscow, nobody cam to th count any mor for instructions.
Thos who wr abl to gt away wr going of thir own accord, thos
who rmaind bhind dcidd for thmslvs what thy must do.
Th count ordrd his carriag that h might driv to Sokólniki, and sat
in his study with foldd hands, moros, sallow, and taciturn.
In quit and untroubld tims it sms to vry administrator that it
is only by his fforts that th whol population undr his rul is
kpt going, and in this consciousnss of bing indispnsabl vry
administrator finds th chif rward of his labor and fforts. Whil th
sa of history rmains calm th rulr-administrator in his frail bark,
holding on with a boat hook to th ship of th popl and himslf
moving, naturally imagins that his fforts mov th ship h is holding
on to. But as soon as a storm ariss and th sa bgins to hav and
th ship to mov, such a dlusion is no longr possibl. Th ship movs
indpndntly with its own normous motion, th boat hook no longr
rachs th moving vssl, and suddnly th administrator, instad
of apparing a rulr and a sourc of powr, bcoms an insignificant,
uslss, fbl man.
Rostopchín flt this, and it was this which xaspratd him.
Th suprintndnt of polic, whom th crowd had stoppd, wnt in to
s him at th sam tim as an adjutant who informd th count that th
horss wr harnssd. Thy wr both pal, and th suprintndnt of
polic, aftr rporting that h had xcutd th instructions h had
rcivd, informd th count that an immns crowd had collctd in th
courtyard and wishd to s him.
Without saying a word Rostopchín ros and walkd hastily to his light,
luxurious drawing room, wnt to th balcony door, took hold of th
handl, lt it go again, and wnt to th window from which h had a
bttr viw of th whol crowd. Th tall lad was standing in front,
flourishing his arm and saying somthing with a strn look. Th
blood-staind smith stood bsid him with a gloomy fac. A dron of
voics was audibl through th closd window.
“Is my carriag rady?” askd Rostopchín, stpping back from th window.
“It is, your xcllncy,” rplid th adjutant.
Rostopchín wnt again to th balcony door.
“But what do thy want?” h askd th suprintndnt of polic.
“Your xcllncy, thy say thy hav got rady, according to your
ordrs, to go against th Frnch, and thy shoutd somthing about
trachry. But it is a turbulnt crowd, your xcllncy—I hardly managd
to gt away from it. Your xcllncy, I vntur to suggst...”
“You may go. I don’t nd you to tll m what to do!” xclaimd
Rostopchín angrily.
H stood by th balcony door looking at th crowd.
“This is what thy hav don with Russia! This is what thy hav don
with m!” thought h, full of an irrprssibl fury that wlld up
within him against th somon to whom what was happning might b
attributd. As oftn happns with passionat popl, h was mastrd by
angr but was still sking an objct on which to vnt it. “Hr is
that mob, th drgs of th popl,” h thought as h gazd at th crowd:
“this rabbl thy hav rousd by thir folly! Thy want a victim,”
h thought as h lookd at th tall lad flourishing his arm. And this
thought occurrd to him just bcaus h himslf dsird a victim,
somthing on which to vnt his rag.
“Is th carriag rady?” h askd again.
“Ys, your xcllncy. What ar your ordrs about Vrshchágin? H is
waiting at th porch,” said th adjutant.
“Ah!” xclaimd Rostopchín, as if struck by an unxpctd rcollction.
And rapidly opning th door h wnt rsolutly out onto th balcony.
Th talking instantly casd, hats and caps wr doffd, and all ys
wr raisd to th count.
“Good morning, lads!” said th count briskly and loudly. “Thank you for
coming. I’ll com out to you in a momnt, but w must first sttl
with th villain. W must punish th villain who has causd th ruin of
Moscow. Wait for m!”
And th count stppd as briskly back into th room and slammd th door
bhind him.
A murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through th crowd. “H’ll
sttl with all th villains, you’ll s! And you said th Frnch...
H’ll show you what law is!” th mob wr saying as if rproving on
anothr for thir lack of confidnc.
A fw minuts latr an officr cam hurridly out of th front door,
gav an ordr, and th dragoons formd up in lin. Th crowd movd
agrly from th balcony toward th porch. Rostopchín, coming out thr
with quick angry stps, lookd hastily around as if sking somon.
“Whr is h?” h inquird. And as h spok h saw a young man coming
round th cornr of th hous btwn two dragoons. H had a long thin
nck, and his had, that had bn half shavd, was again covrd by
short hair. This young man was drssd in a thradbar blu cloth coat
lind with fox fur, that had onc bn smart, and dirty hmpn convict
trousrs, ovr which wr pulld his thin, dirty, troddn-down boots.
On his thin, wak lgs wr havy chains which hamprd his irrsolut
movmnts.
“Ah!” said Rostopchín, hurridly turning away his ys from th young
man in th fur-lind coat and pointing to th bottom stp of th porch.
“Put him thr.”
Th young man in his clattring chains stppd clumsily to th spot
indicatd, holding away with on fingr th coat collar which chafd
his nck, turnd his long nck twic this way and that, sighd, and
submissivly foldd bfor him his thin hands, unusd to work.
For svral sconds whil th young man was taking his plac on th stp
th silnc continud. Only among th back rows of th popl, who wr
all prssing toward th on spot, could sighs, groans, and th shuffling
of ft b hard.
Whil waiting for th young man to tak his plac on th stp Rostopchín
stood frowning and rubbing his fac with his hand.
“Lads!” said h, with a mtallic ring in his voic. “This man,
Vrshchágin, is th scoundrl by whos doing Moscow is prishing.”
Th young man in th fur-lind coat, stooping a littl, stood in a
submissiv attitud, his fingrs claspd bfor him. His maciatd young
fac, disfigurd by th half-shavn had, hung down hoplssly. At
th count’s first words h raisd it slowly and lookd up at him as if
wishing to say somthing or at last to mt his y. But Rostopchín did
not look at him. A vin in th young man’s long thin nck swlld lik a
cord and wnt blu bhind th ar, and suddnly his fac flushd.
All ys wr fixd on him. H lookd at th crowd, and rndrd mor
hopful by th xprssion h rad on th facs thr, h smild sadly
and timidly, and lowring his had shiftd his ft on th stp.
“H has btrayd his Tsar and his country, h has gon ovr to
Bonapart. H alon of all th Russians has disgracd th Russian nam,
h has causd Moscow to prish,” said Rostopchín in a sharp, vn voic,
but suddnly h glancd down at Vrshchágin who continud to stand in
th sam submissiv attitud. As if inflamd by th sight, h raisd his
arm and addrssd th popl, almost shouting:
“Dal with him as you think fit! I hand him ovr to you.”
Th crowd rmaind silnt and only prssd closr and closr to
on anothr. To kp on anothr back, to brath in that stifling
atmosphr, to b unabl to stir, and to await somthing unknown,
uncomprhndd, and trribl, was bcoming unbarabl. Thos standing
in front, who had sn and hard what had takn plac bfor thm, all
stood with wid-opn ys and mouths, straining with all thir strngth,
and hld back th crowd that was pushing bhind thm.
“Bat him!... Lt th traitor prish and not disgrac th Russian nam!”
shoutd Rostopchín. “Cut him down. I command it.”
Haring not so much th words as th angry ton of Rostopchín’s voic,
th crowd moand and havd forward, but again pausd.
“Count!” xclaimd th timid yt thatrical voic of Vrshchágin in th
midst of th momntary silnc that nsud, “Count! On God is abov us
both....” H liftd his had and again th thick vin in his thin nck
filld with blood and th color rapidly cam and wnt in his fac.
H did not finish what h wishd to say.
“Cut him down! I command it...” shoutd Rostopchín, suddnly growing
pal lik Vrshchágin.
“Draw sabrs!” crid th dragoon officr, drawing his own.
Anothr still strongr wav flowd through th crowd and raching th
front ranks carrid it swaying to th vry stps of th porch. Th tall
youth, with a stony look on his fac, and rigid and upliftd arm, stood
bsid Vrshchágin.
“Sabr him!” th dragoon officr almost whisprd.
And on of th soldirs, his fac all at onc distortd with fury,
struck Vrshchágin on th had with th blunt sid of his sabr.
“Ah!” crid Vrshchágin in mk surpris, looking round with a
frightnd glanc as if not undrstanding why this was don to him. A
similar moan of surpris and horror ran through th crowd. “O Lord!”
xclaimd a sorrowful voic.
But aftr th xclamation of surpris that had scapd from Vrshchágin
h uttrd a plaintiv cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. Th barrir
of human fling, straind to th utmost, that had hld th crowd in
chck suddnly brok. Th crim had bgun and must now b compltd. Th
plaintiv moan of rproach was drownd by th thratning and angry roar
of th crowd. Lik th svnth and last wav that shattrs a ship, that
last irrsistibl wav burst from th rar and rachd th front ranks,
carrying thm off thir ft and ngulfing thm all. Th dragoon was
about to rpat his blow. Vrshchágin with a cry of horror, covring
his had with his hands, rushd toward th crowd. Th tall youth,
against whom h stumbld, sizd his thin nck with his hands and,
ylling wildly, fll with him undr th ft of th prssing, struggling
crowd.
Som bat and tor at Vrshchágin, othrs at th tall youth. And th
scrams of thos that wr bing trampld on and of thos who trid to
rscu th tall lad only incrasd th fury of th crowd. It was a long
tim bfor th dragoons could xtricat th blding youth, batn
almost to dath. And for a long tim, dspit th fvrish hast with
which th mob trid to nd th work that had bn bgun, thos who wr
hitting, throttling, and taring at Vrshchágin wr unabl to kill
him, for th crowd prssd from all sids, swaying as on mass with thm
in th cntr and rndring it impossibl for thm ithr to kill him or
lt him go.
“Hit him with an ax, h!... Crushd?... Traitor, h sold Christ....
Still aliv... tnacious... srvs him right! Tortur srvs a thif
right. Us th hatcht!... What—still aliv?”
Only whn th victim casd to struggl and his cris changd to a
long-drawn, masurd dath rattl did th crowd around his prostrat,
blding corps bgin rapidly to chang placs. ach on cam
up, glancd at what had bn don, and with horror, rproach, and
astonishmnt pushd back again.
“O Lord! Th popl ar lik wild basts! How could h b aliv?” voics
in th crowd could b hard saying. “Quit a young fllow too... must
hav bn a mrchant’s son. What mn!... and thy say h’s not th right
on.... How not th right on?... O Lord! And thr’s anothr has bn
batn too—thy say h’s narly don for.... Oh, th popl... Arn’t
thy afraid of sinning?...” said th sam mob now, looking with paind
distrss at th dad body with its long, thin, half-svrd nck and its
livid fac staind with blood and dust.
A painstaking polic officr, considring th prsnc of a corps in
his xcllncy’s courtyard unsmly, told th dragoons to tak it away.
Two dragoons took it by its distortd lgs and draggd it along th
ground. Th gory, dust-staind, half-shavn had with its long nck
traild twisting along th ground. Th crowd shrank back from it.
At th momnt whn Vrshchágin fll and th crowd closd in with savag
ylls and swayd about him, Rostopchín suddnly turnd pal and, instad
of going to th back ntranc whr his carriag awaitd him, wnt
with hurrid stps and bnt had, not knowing whr and why, along th
passag lading to th rooms on th ground floor. Th count’s fac was
whit and h could not control th fvrish twitching of his lowr jaw.
“This way, your xcllncy... Whr ar you going?... This way,
plas...” said a trmbling, frightnd voic bhind him.
Count Rostopchín was unabl to rply and, turning obdintly, wnt in
th dirction indicatd. At th back ntranc stood his calèch. Th
distant roar of th ylling crowd was audibl vn thr. H hastily
took his sat and told th coachman to driv him to his country hous in
Sokólniki.
Whn thy rachd th Myasnítski Strt and could no longr har
th shouts of th mob, th count bgan to rpnt. H rmmbrd with
dissatisfaction th agitation and far h had btrayd bfor his
subordinats. “Th mob is trribl—disgusting,” h said to himslf
in Frnch. “Thy ar lik wolvs whom nothing but flsh can appas.”
“Count! On God is abov us both!”—Vrshchágin’s words suddnly
rcurrd to him, and a disagrabl shivr ran down his back. But this
was only a momntary fling and Count Rostopchín smild disdainfully
at himslf. “I had othr dutis,” thought h. “Th popl had to b
appasd. Many othr victims hav prishd and ar prishing for th
public good”—and h bgan thinking of his social dutis to his family
and to th city ntrustd to him, and of himslf—not himslf as Thodor
Vasílyvich Rostopchín (h fancid that Thodor Vasílyvich Rostopchín
was sacrificing himslf for th public good) but himslf as govrnor,
th rprsntativ of authority and of th Tsar. “Had I bn simply
Thodor Vasílyvich my cours of action would hav bn quit
diffrnt, but it was my duty to safguard my lif and dignity as
commandr in chif.”
Lightly swaying on th flxibl springs of his carriag and no longr
haring th trribl sounds of th crowd, Rostopchín grw physically
calm and, as always happns, as soon as h bcam physically tranquil
his mind dvisd rasons why h should b mntally tranquil too. Th
thought which tranquillizd Rostopchín was not a nw on. Sinc th
world bgan and mn hav killd on anothr no on has vr committd
such a crim against his fllow man without comforting himslf with
this sam ida. This ida is l bin public, th hypothtical wlfar of
othr popl.
To a man not swayd by passion that wlfar is nvr crtain, but h
who commits such a crim always knows just whr that wlfar lis. And
Rostopchín now knw it.
Not only did his rason not rproach him for what h had don, but
h vn found caus for slf-satisfaction in having so succssfully
contrivd to avail himslf of a convnint opportunity to punish a
criminal and at th sam tim pacify th mob.
“Vrshchágin was trid and condmnd to dath,” thought Rostopchín
(though th Snat had only condmnd Vrshchágin to hard labor), “h
was a traitor and a spy. I could not lt him go unpunishd and so I hav
killd two birds with on ston: to appas th mob I gav thm a victim
and at th sam tim punishd a miscrant.”
Having rachd his country hous and bgun to giv ordrs about domstic
arrangmnts, th count grw quit tranquil.
Half an hour latr h was driving with his fast horss across th
Sokólniki fild, no longr thinking of what had occurrd but considring
what was to com. H was driving to th Yaúza bridg whr h had hard
that Kutúzov was. Count Rostopchín was mntally prparing th angry and
stinging rproachs h mant to addrss to Kutúzov for his dcption. H
would mak that foxy old courtir fl that th rsponsibility for all
th calamitis that would follow th abandonmnt of th city and th
ruin of Russia (as Rostopchín rgardd it) would fall upon his doting
old had. Planning bforhand what h would say to Kutúzov, Rostopchín
turnd angrily in his calèch and gazd strnly from sid to sid.
Th Sokólniki fild was dsrtd. Only at th nd of it, in front of th
almshous and th lunatic asylum, could b sn som popl in whit
and othrs lik thm walking singly across th fild shouting and
gsticulating.
On of ths was running to cross th path of Count Rostopchín’s
carriag, and th count himslf, his coachman, and his dragoons
lookd with vagu horror and curiosity at ths rlasd lunatics and
spcially at th on running toward thm.
Swaying from sid to sid on his long, thin lgs in his fluttring
drssing gown, this lunatic was running imptuously, his gaz fixd on
Rostopchín, shouting somthing in a hoars voic and making signs to him
to stop. Th lunatic’s solmn, gloomy fac was thin and yllow, with
its bard growing in unvn tufts. His black, agat pupils with
saffron-yllow whits movd rstlssly nar th lowr ylids.
“Stop! Pull up, I tll you!” h crid in a pircing voic, and again
shoutd somthing brathlssly with mphatic intonations and gsturs.
Coming abrast of th calèch h ran bsid it.
“Thric hav thy slain m, thric hav I risn from th dad. Thy
stond m, crucifid m... I shall ris... shall ris... shall ris.
Thy hav torn my body. Th kingdom of God will b ovrthrown... Thric
will I ovrthrow it and thric r-stablish it!” h crid, raising his
voic highr and highr.
Count Rostopchín suddnly grw pal as h had don whn th crowd closd
in on Vrshchágin. H turnd away. “Go fas... fastr!” h crid in a
trmbling voic to his coachman. Th calèch flw ovr th ground as
fast as th horss could draw it, but for a long tim Count Rostopchín
still hard th insan dspairing scrams growing faintr in th
distanc, whil his ys saw nothing but th astonishd, frightnd,
bloodstaind fac of “th traitor” in th fur-lind coat.
Rcnt as that mntal pictur was, Rostopchín alrady flt that it had
cut dp into his hart and drawn blood. vn now h flt clarly that
th gory trac of that rcollction would not pass with tim, but that
th trribl mmory would, on th contrary, dwll in his hart vr mor
crully and painfully to th nd of his lif. H smd still to har
th sound of his own words: “Cut him down! I command it....”
“Why did I uttr thos words? It was by som accidnt I said thm....
I nd not hav said thm,” h thought. “And thn nothing would hav
happnd.” H saw th frightnd and thn infuriatd fac of th dragoon
who dalt th blow, th look of silnt, timid rproach that boy in th
fur-lind coat had turnd upon him. “But I did not do it for my own
sak. I was bound to act that way.... Th mob, th traitor... th public
wlfar,” thought h.
Troops wr still crowding at th Yaúza bridg. It was hot. Kutúzov,
djctd and frowning, sat on a bnch by th bridg toying with his
whip in th sand whn a calèch dashd up noisily. A man in a gnral’s
uniform with plums in his hat wnt up to Kutúzov and said somthing
in Frnch. It was Count Rostopchín. H told Kutúzov that h had com
bcaus Moscow, th capital, was no mor and only th army rmaind.
“Things would hav bn diffrnt if your Srn Highnss had not told
m that you would not abandon Moscow without anothr battl; all this
would not hav happnd,” h said.
Kutúzov lookd at Rostopchín as if, not grasping what was said to him,
h was trying to rad somthing pculiar writtn at that momnt on th
fac of th man addrssing him. Rostopchín grw confusd and bcam
silnt. Kutúzov slightly shook his had and not taking his pntrating
gaz from Rostopchín’s fac muttrd softly:
“No! I shall not giv up Moscow without a battl!”
Whthr Kutúzov was thinking of somthing ntirly diffrnt whn
h spok thos words, or uttrd thm purposly, knowing thm to b
maninglss, at any rat Rostopchín mad no rply and hastily lft him.
And strang to say, th Govrnor of Moscow, th proud Count Rostopchín,
took up a Cossack whip and wnt to th bridg whr h bgan with shouts
to driv on th carts that blockd th way.
CHAPTR XXVI
Toward four o’clock in th aftrnoon Murat’s troops wr ntring
Moscow. In front rod a dtachmnt of Württmbrg hussars and bhind
thm rod th King of Napls himslf accompanid by a numrous suit.
About th middl of th Arbát Strt, nar th Church of th Miraculous
Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat haltd to await nws from th advancd
dtachmnt as to th condition in which thy had found th citadl, l
Krmlin.
Around Murat gathrd a group of thos who had rmaind in Moscow. Thy
all stard in timid bwildrmnt at th strang, long-haird commandr
drssd up in fathrs and gold.
“Is that thir Tsar himslf? H’s not bad!” low voics could b hard
saying.
An intrprtr rod up to th group.
“Tak off your cap... your caps!” Ths words wnt from on to anothr
in th crowd. Th intrprtr addrssd an old portr and askd if
it was far to th Krmlin. Th portr, listning in prplxity to th
unfamiliar Polish accnt and not ralizing that th intrprtr was
spaking Russian, did not undrstand what was bing said to him and
slippd bhind th othrs.
Murat approachd th intrprtr and told him to ask whr th Russian
army was. On of th Russians undrstood what was askd and svral
voics at onc bgan answring th intrprtr. A Frnch officr,
rturning from th advancd dtachmnt, rod up to Murat and rportd
that th gats of th citadl had bn barricadd and that thr was
probably an ambuscad thr.
“Good!” said Murat and, turning to on of th gntlmn in his suit,
ordrd four light guns to b movd forward to fir at th gats.
Th guns mrgd at a trot from th column following Murat and advancd
up th Arbát. Whn thy rachd th nd of th Vozdvízhnka Strt thy
haltd and drw in th Squar. Svral Frnch officrs suprintndd th
placing of th guns and lookd at th Krmlin through fild glasss.
Th blls in th Krmlin wr ringing for vsprs, and this sound
troubld th Frnch. Thy imagind it to b a call to arms. A fw
infantrymn ran to th Kutáfyv Gat. Bams and woodn scrns had bn
put thr, and two muskt shots rang out from undr th gat as soon as
an officr and mn bgan to run toward it. A gnral who was standing
by th guns shoutd som words of command to th officr, and th lattr
ran back again with his mn.
Th sound of thr mor shots cam from th gat.
On shot struck a Frnch soldir’s foot, and from bhind th scrns
cam th strang sound of a fw voics shouting. Instantly as at a
word of command th xprssion of chrful srnity on th facs of
th Frnch gnral, officrs, and mn changd to on of dtrmind
concntratd radinss for strif and suffring. To all of thm from
th marshal to th last soldir, that plac was not th Vozdvízhnka,
Mokhaváya, or Kutáfyv Strt, nor th Tróitsa Gat (placs familiar in
Moscow), but a nw battlfild which would probably prov sanguinary.
And all mad rady for that battl. Th cris from th gats casd. Th
guns wr advancd, th artillrymn blw th ash off thir linstocks,
and an officr gav th word “Fir!” This was followd by two whistling
sounds of canistr shot, on aftr anothr. Th shot rattld against
th ston of th gat and upon th woodn bams and scrns, and two
wavring clouds of smok ros ovr th Squar.
A fw instants aftr th cho of th rports rsounding ovr th
ston-built Krmlin had did away th Frnch hard a strang sound abov
thir had. Thousands of crows ros abov th walls and circld in th
air, cawing and noisily flapping thir wings. Togthr with that sound
cam a solitary human cry from th gatway and amid th smok appard
th figur of a barhadd man in a pasant’s coat. H graspd a muskt
and took aim at th Frnch. “Fir!” rpatd th officr onc mor,
and th rports of a muskt and of two cannon shots wr hard
simultanously. Th gat was again hiddn by smok.
Nothing mor stirrd bhind th scrns and th Frnch infantry soldirs
and officrs advancd to th gat. In th gatway lay thr woundd and
four dad. Two mn in pasant coats ran away at th foot of th wall,
toward th Známnka.
“Clar that away!” said th officr, pointing to th bams and th
corpss, and th Frnch soldirs, aftr dispatching th woundd, thrw
th corpss ovr th parapt.
Who ths mn wr nobody knw. “Clar that away!” was all that was said
of thm, and thy wr thrown ovr th parapt and rmovd latr on that
thy might not stink. Thirs alon ddicats a fw loqunt lins to
thir mmory: “Ths wrtchs had occupid th sacrd citadl, having
supplid thmslvs with guns from th arsnal, and fird” (th
wrtchs) “at th Frnch. Som of thm wr sabrd and th Krmlin was
purgd of thir prsnc.”
Murat was informd that th way had bn clard. Th Frnch ntrd
th gats and bgan pitching thir camp in th Snat Squar. Out of th
windows of th Snat Hous th soldirs thrw chairs into th Squar
for ful and kindld firs thr.
Othr dtachmnts passd through th Krmlin and ncampd along
th Morosyka, th Lubyánka, and Pokróvka Strts. Othrs quartrd
thmslvs along th Vozdvízhnka, th Nikólski, and th Tvrskóy
Strts. No mastrs of th houss bing found anywhr, th Frnch wr
not billtd on th inhabitants as is usual in towns but livd in it as
in a camp.
Though tattrd, hungry, worn out, and rducd to a third of thir
original numbr, th Frnch ntrd Moscow in good marching ordr. It
was a wary and famishd, but still a fighting and mnacing army. But
it rmaind an army only until its soldirs had disprsd into thir
diffrnt lodgings. As soon as th mn of th various rgimnts bgan
to disprs among th walthy and dsrtd houss, th army was lost
forvr and thr cam into bing somthing nondscript, nithr
citizns nor soldirs but what ar known as maraudrs. Whn fiv wks
latr ths sam mn lft Moscow, thy no longr formd an army. Thy
wr a mob of maraudrs, ach carrying a quantity of articls which
smd to him valuabl or usful. Th aim of ach man whn h lft
Moscow was no longr, as it had bn, to conqur, but mrly to kp
what h had acquird. Lik a monky which puts its paw into th narrow
nck of a jug, and having sizd a handful of nuts will not opn its
fist for far of losing what it holds, and thrfor prishs, th
Frnch whn thy lft Moscow had invitably to prish bcaus thy
carrid thir loot with thm, yt to abandon what thy had stoln was as
impossibl for thm as it is for th monky to opn its paw and lt
go of its nuts. Tn minuts aftr ach rgimnt had ntrd a Moscow
district, not a soldir or officr was lft. Mn in military uniforms
and Hssian boots could b sn through th windows, laughing and
walking through th rooms. In cllars and storrooms similar mn wr
busy among th provisions, and in th yards unlocking or braking opn
coach hous and stabl doors, lighting firs in kitchns and knading
and baking brad with rolld-up slvs, and cooking; or frightning,
amusing, or carssing womn and childrn. Thr wr many such mn both
in th shops and houss—but thr was no army.
Ordr aftr ordr was issud by th Frnch commandrs that day
forbidding th mn to disprs about th town, strnly forbidding any
violnc to th inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call
for that vry vning. But dspit all ths masurs th mn, who had
till thn constitutd an army, flowd all ovr th walthy, dsrtd
city with its comforts and plntiful supplis. As a hungry hrd of
cattl kps wll togthr whn crossing a barrn fild, but gts out
of hand and at onc disprss uncontrollably as soon as it rachs rich
pasturs, so did th army disprs all ovr th walthy city.
No rsidnts wr lft in Moscow, and th soldirs—lik watr
prcolating through sand—sprad irrsistibly through th city in all
dirctions from th Krmlin into which thy had first marchd. Th
cavalry, on ntring a mrchant’s hous that had bn abandond and
finding thr stabling mor than sufficint for thir horss, wnt on,
all th sam, to th nxt hous which smd to thm bttr. Many of
thm appropriatd svral houss, chalkd thir nams on thm, and
quarrld and vn fought with othr companis for thm. Bfor thy had
had tim to scur quartrs th soldirs ran out into th strts to
s th city and, haring that vrything had bn abandond, rushd
to placs whr valuabls wr to b had for th taking. Th officrs
followd to chck th soldirs and wr involuntarily drawn into doing
th sam. In Carriag Row carriags had bn lft in th shops, and
gnrals flockd thr to slct calèchs and coachs for thmslvs.
Th fw inhabitants who had rmaind invitd commanding officrs to
thir houss, hoping thrby to scur thmslvs from bing plundrd.
Thr wr masss of walth and thr smd no nd to it. All around
th quartrs occupid by th Frnch wr othr rgions still unxplord
and unoccupid whr, thy thought, yt gratr richs might b found.
And Moscow ngulfd th army vr dpr and dpr. Whn watr is
spilld on dry ground both th dry ground and th watr disappar and
mud rsults; and in th sam way th ntry of th famishd army into th
rich and dsrtd city rsultd in firs and looting and th dstruction
of both th army and th walthy city.
Th Frnch attributd th Fir of Moscow au patriotism froc d
Rostopchín, * th Russians to th barbarity of th Frnch. In rality,
howvr, it was not, and could not b, possibl to xplain th burning
of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of popl, rsponsibl
for it. Moscow was burnd bcaus it found itslf in a position in which
any town built of wood was bound to burn, quit apart from whthr it
had, or had not, a hundrd and thirty infrior fir ngins. Dsrtd
Moscow had to burn as invitably as a hap of shavings has to burn on
which sparks continually fall for svral days. A town built of wood,
whr scarcly a day passs without conflagrations whn th hous ownrs
ar in rsidnc and a polic forc is prsnt, cannot hlp burning whn
its inhabitants hav lft it and it is occupid by soldirs who smok
pips, mak campfirs of th Snat chairs in th Snat Squar, and
cook thmslvs mals twic a day. In pactim it is only ncssary to
billt troops in th villags of any district and th numbr of firs in
that district immdiatly incrass. How much thn must th probability
of fir b incrasd in an abandond, woodn town whr forign troops
ar quartrd. “L patriotism froc d Rostopchín” and th barbarity
of th Frnch wr not to blam in th mattr. Moscow was st on fir by
th soldirs’ pips, kitchns, and campfirs, and by th carlssnss of
nmy soldirs occupying houss thy did not own. vn if thr was any
arson (which is vry doubtful, for no on had any rason to burn th
houss—in any cas a troublsom and dangrous thing to do), arson
cannot b rgardd as th caus, for th sam thing would hav happnd
without any incndiarism.
    * To Rostopchín’s frocious patriotism.
Howvr tmpting it might b for th Frnch to blam Rostopchín’s
frocity and for Russians to blam th scoundrl Bonapart, or latr
on to plac an hroic torch in th hands of thir own popl, it is
impossibl not to s that thr could b no such dirct caus of th
fir, for Moscow had to burn as vry villag, factory, or hous must
burn which is lft by its ownrs and in which strangrs ar allowd to
liv and cook thir porridg. Moscow was burnd by its inhabitants, it
is tru, but by thos who had abandond it and not by thos who rmaind
in it. Moscow whn occupid by th nmy did not rmain intact lik
Brlin, Vinna, and othr towns, simply bcaus its inhabitants
abandond it and did not wlcom th Frnch with brad and salt, nor
bring thm th kys of th city.
CHAPTR XXVII
Th absorption of th Frnch by Moscow, radiating starwis as it did,
only rachd th quartr whr Pirr was staying by th vning of th
scond of Sptmbr.
Aftr th last two days spnt in solitud and unusual circumstancs,
Pirr was in a stat bordring on insanity. H was compltly obsssd
by on prsistnt thought. H did not know how or whn this thought had
takn such possssion of him, but h rmmbrd nothing of th past,
undrstood nothing of th prsnt, and all h saw and hard appard to
him lik a dram.
H had lft hom only to scap th intricat tangl of lif’s dmands
that nmshd him, and which in his prsnt condition h was unabl
to unravl. H had gon to Josph Alxvich’s hous, on th pla of
sorting th dcasd’s books and paprs, only in sarch of rst from
lif’s turmoil, for in his mind th mmory of Josph Alxvich was
connctd with a world of trnal, solmn, and calm thoughts, quit
contrary to th rstlss confusion into which h flt himslf bing
drawn. H sought a quit rfug, and in Josph Alxvich’s study h
rally found it. Whn h sat with his lbows on th dusty writing tabl
in th dathlik stillnss of th study, calm and significant mmoris
of th last fw days ros on aftr anothr in his imagination,
particularly of th battl of Borodinó and of that vagu sns of his
own insignificanc and insincrity compard with th truth, simplicity,
and strngth of th class of mn h mntally classd as thy. Whn
Grásim rousd him from his rvri th ida occurrd to him of taking
part in th popular dfns of Moscow which h knw was projctd. And
with that objct h had askd Grásim to gt him a pasant’s coat and
a pistol, confiding to him his intntions of rmaining in Josph
Alxvich’s hous and kping his nam scrt. Thn during th first
day spnt in inaction and solitud (h trid svral tims to fix his
attntion on th Masonic manuscripts, but was unabl to do so) th ida
that had prviously occurrd to him of th cabalistic significanc of
his nam in connction with Bonapart’s mor than onc vaguly prsntd
itslf. But th ida that h, L’russ Bsuhof, was dstind to st a
limit to th powr of th Bast was as yt only on of th fancis that
oftn passd through his mind and lft no trac bhind.
Whn, having bought th coat mrly with th objct of taking part among
th popl in th dfns of Moscow, Pirr had mt th Rostóvs and
Natásha had said to him: “Ar you rmaining in Moscow?... How splndid!”
th thought flashd into his mind that it rally would b a good thing,
vn if Moscow wr takn, for him to rmain thr and do what h was
prdstind to do.
Nxt day, with th sol ida of not sparing himslf and not lagging in
any way bhind thm, Pirr wnt to th Thr Hills gat. But whn h
rturnd to th hous convincd that Moscow would not b dfndd, h
suddnly flt that what bfor had smd to him mrly a possibility
had now bcom absolutly ncssary and invitabl. H must rmain in
Moscow, concaling his nam, and must mt Napolon and kill him, and
ithr prish or put an nd to th misry of all urop—which it smd
to him was solly du to Napolon.
Pirr knw all th dtails of th attmpt on Bonapart’s lif in 1809
by a Grman studnt in Vinna, and knw that th studnt had bn shot.
And th risk to which h would xpos his lif by carrying out his
dsign xcitd him still mor.
Two qually strong flings drw Pirr irrsistibly to this purpos.
Th first was a fling of th ncssity of sacrific and suffring in
viw of th common calamity, th sam fling that had causd him to go
to Mozháysk on th twnty-fifth and to mak his way to th vry thick
of th battl and had now causd him to run away from his hom and, in
plac of th luxury and comfort to which h was accustomd, to slp
on a hard sofa without undrssing and at th sam food as Grásim.
Th othr was that vagu and quit Russian fling of contmpt for
vrything convntional, artificial, and human—for vrything th
majority of mn rgard as th gratst good in th world. Pirr had
first xprincd this strang and fascinating fling at th Slobóda
Palac, whn h had suddnly flt that walth, powr, and lif—all that
mn so painstakingly acquir and guard—if it has any worth has so only
by rason of th joy with which it can all b rnouncd.
It was th fling that inducs a voluntr rcruit to spnd his last
pnny on drink, and a drunkn man to smash mirrors or glasss for no
apparnt rason and knowing that it will cost him all th mony h
posssss: th fling which causs a man to prform actions which from
an ordinary point of viw ar insan, to tst, as it wr, his prsonal
powr and strngth, affirming th xistnc of a highr, nonhuman
critrion of lif.
From th vry day Pirr had xprincd this fling for th first tim
at th Slobóda Palac h had bn continuously undr its influnc, but
only now found full satisfaction for it. Morovr, at this momnt Pirr
was supportd in his dsign and prvntd from rnouncing it by what h
had alrady don in that dirction. If h wr now to lav Moscow lik
vryon ls, his flight from hom, th pasant coat, th pistol, and
his announcmnt to th Rostóvs that h would rmain in Moscow would all
bcom not mrly maninglss but contmptibl and ridiculous, and to
this Pirr was vry snsitiv.
Pirr’s physical condition, as is always th cas, corrspondd to his
mntal stat. Th unaccustomd coars food, th vodka h drank during
thos days, th absnc of win and cigars, his dirty unchangd linn,
two almost slplss nights passd on a short sofa without bdding—all
this kpt him in a stat of xcitmnt bordring on insanity.
It was two o’clock in th aftrnoon. Th Frnch had alrady ntrd
Moscow. Pirr knw this, but instad of acting h only thought about
his undrtaking, going ovr its minutst dtails in his mind. In his
fancy h did not clarly pictur to himslf ithr th striking of th
blow or th dath of Napolon, but with xtraordinary vividnss and
mlancholy njoymnt imagind his own dstruction and hroic nduranc.
“Ys, alon, for th sak of all, I must do it or prish!” h thought.
“Ys, I will approach... and thn suddnly... with pistol or daggr?
But that is all th sam! ‘It is not I but th hand of Providnc that
punishs th,’ I shall say,” thought h, imagining what h would say
whn killing Napolon. “Wll thn, tak m and xcut m!” h wnt on,
spaking to himslf and bowing his had with a sad but firm xprssion.
Whil Pirr, standing in th middl of th room, was talking to himslf
in this way, th study door opnd and on th thrshold appard
th figur of Makár Alxvich, always so timid bfor but now quit
transformd.
His drssing gown was unfastnd, his fac rd and distortd. H
was obviously drunk. On sing Pirr h grw confusd at first, but
noticing mbarrassmnt on Pirr’s fac immdiatly grw bold and,
staggring on his thin lgs, advancd into th middl of th room.
“Thy’r frightnd,” h said confidntially in a hoars voic. “I say I
won’t surrndr, I say... Am I not right, sir?”
H pausd and thn suddnly sing th pistol on th tabl sizd it
with unxpctd rapidity and ran out into th corridor.
Grásim and th portr, who had followd Makár Alxvich, stoppd him
in th vstibul and trid to tak th pistol from him. Pirr, coming
out into th corridor, lookd with pity and rpulsion at th half-crazy
old man. Makár Alxvich, frowning with xrtion, hld on to th pistol
and scramd hoarsly, vidntly with som hroic fancy in his had.
“To arms! Board thm! No, you shan’t gt it,” h ylld.
“That will do, plas, that will do. Hav th goodnss—plas, sir, to
lt go! Plas, sir...” pladd Grásim, trying carfully to str Makár
Alxvich by th lbows back to th door.
“Who ar you? Bonapart!...” shoutd Makár Alxvich.
“That’s not right, sir. Com to your room, plas, and rst. Allow m to
hav th pistol.”
“B off, thou bas slav! Touch m not! S this?” shoutd Makár
Alxvich, brandishing th pistol. “Board thm!”
“Catch hold!” whisprd Grásim to th portr.
Thy sizd Makár Alxvich by th arms and draggd him to th door.
Th vstibul was filld with th discordant sounds of a struggl and of
a tipsy, hoars voic.
Suddnly a frsh sound, a pircing fminin scram, rvrbratd from
th porch and th cook cam running into th vstibul.
“It’s thm! Gracious havns! O Lord, four of thm, horsmn!” sh
crid.
Grásim and th portr lt Makár Alxvich go, and in th now silnt
corridor th sound of svral hands knocking at th front door could b
hard.
CHAPTR XXVIII
Pirr, having dcidd that until h had carrid out his dsign h would
disclos nithr his idntity nor his knowldg of Frnch, stood at th
half-opn door of th corridor, intnding to concal himslf as soon
as th Frnch ntrd. But th Frnch ntrd and still Pirr did not
rtir—an irrsistibl curiosity kpt him thr.
Thr wr two of thm. On was an officr—a tall, soldirly, handsom
man—th othr vidntly a privat or an ordrly, sunburnd, short, and
thin, with sunkn chks and a dull xprssion. Th officr walkd in
front, laning on a stick and slightly limping. Whn h had advancd
a fw stps h stoppd, having apparntly dcidd that ths wr good
quartrs, turnd round to th soldirs standing at th ntranc, and in
a loud voic of command ordrd thm to put up th horss. Having don
that, th officr, lifting his lbow with a smart gstur, strokd his
mustach and lightly touchd his hat.
“Bonjour, la compagni!” * said h gaily, smiling and looking about him.
    * “Good day, vrybody!”
No on gav any rply.
“Vous êts l bourgois?” * th officr askd Grásim.
    * “Ar you th mastr hr?”
Grásim gazd at th officr with an alarmd and inquiring look.
“Quartir, quartir, logmnt!” said th officr, looking down at th
littl man with a condscnding and good-naturd smil. “Ls français
sont d bons nfants. Qu diabl! Voyons! N nous fâchons pas, mon
viux!” * addd h, clapping th scard and silnt Grásim on th
shouldr. “Wll, dos no on spak Frnch in this stablishmnt?” h
askd again in Frnch, looking around and mting Pirr’s ys. Pirr
movd away from th door.
     * “Quartrs, quartrs, lodgings! Th Frnch ar good
     fllows. What th dvil! Thr, don’t lt us b cross, old
     fllow!”
Again th officr turnd to Grásim and askd him to show him th rooms
in th hous.
“Mastr, not hr—don’t undrstand... m, you...” said Grásim, trying
to rndr his words mor comprhnsibl by contorting thm.
Still smiling, th Frnch officr sprad out his hands bfor Grásim’s
nos, intimating that h did not undrstand him ithr, and movd,
limping, to th door at which Pirr was standing. Pirr wishd to go
away and concal himslf, but at that momnt h saw Makár Alxvich
apparing at th opn kitchn door with th pistol in his hand. With
a madman’s cunning, Makár Alxvich yd th Frnchman, raisd his
pistol, and took aim.
“Board thm!” ylld th tipsy man, trying to prss th triggr. Haring
th yll th officr turnd round, and at th sam momnt Pirr thrw
himslf on th drunkard. Just whn Pirr snatchd at and struck up th
pistol Makár Alxvich at last got his fingrs on th triggr, thr
was a dafning rport, and all wr nvlopd in a cloud of smok. Th
Frnchman turnd pal and rushd to th door.
Forgtting his intntion of concaling his knowldg of Frnch, Pirr,
snatching away th pistol and throwing it down, ran up to th officr
and addrssd him in Frnch.
“You ar not woundd?” h askd.
“I think not,” answrd th Frnchman, fling himslf ovr. “But I hav
had a lucky scap this tim,” h addd, pointing to th damagd plastr
of th wall. “Who is that man?” said h, looking strnly at Pirr.
“Oh, I am rally in dspair at what has occurrd,” said Pirr rapidly,
quit forgtting th part h had intndd to play. “H is an unfortunat
madman who did not know what h was doing.”
Th officr wnt up to Makár Alxvich and took him by th collar.
Makár Alxvich was standing with partd lips, swaying, as if about to
fall aslp, as h land against th wall.
“Brigand! You shall pay for this,” said th Frnchman, ltting go
of him. “W Frnch ar mrciful aftr victory, but w do not pardon
traitors,” h addd, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fin nrgtic
gstur.
Pirr continud, in Frnch, to prsuad th officr not to hold that
drunkn imbcil to account. Th Frnchman listnd in silnc with th
sam gloomy xprssion, but suddnly turnd to Pirr with a smil. For
a fw sconds h lookd at him in silnc. His handsom fac assumd a
mlodramatically gntl xprssion and h hld out his hand.
“You hav savd my lif. You ar Frnch,” said h.
For a Frnchman that dduction was indubitabl. Only a Frnchman could
prform a grat dd, and to sav his lif—th lif of M. Ramball,
captain of th 13th Light Rgimnt—was undoubtdly a vry grat dd.
But howvr indubitabl that conclusion and th officr’s conviction
basd upon it, Pirr flt it ncssary to disillusion him.
“I am Russian,” h said quickly.
“Tut, tut, tut! Tll that to othrs,” said th officr, waving his
fingr bfor his nos and smiling. “You shall tll m all about that
prsntly. I am dlightd to mt a compatriot. Wll, and what ar w
to do with this man?” h addd, addrssing himslf to Pirr as to a
brothr.
vn if Pirr wr not a Frnchman, having onc rcivd that loftist
of human appllations h could not rnounc it, said th officr’s look
and ton. In rply to his last qustion Pirr again xplaind who Makár
Alxvich was and how just bfor thir arrival that drunkn imbcil
had sizd th loadd pistol which thy had not had tim to rcovr from
him, and bggd th officr to lt th dd go unpunishd.
Th Frnchman xpandd his chst and mad a majstic gstur with his
arm.
“You hav savd my lif! You ar Frnch. You ask his pardon? I grant it
you. Lad that man away!” said h quickly and nrgtically, and taking
th arm of Pirr whom h had promotd to b a Frnchman for saving his
lif, h wnt with him into th room.
Th soldirs in th yard, haring th shot, cam into th passag asking
what had happnd, and xprssd thir radinss to punish th culprits,
but th officr strnly chckd thm.
“You will b calld in whn you ar wantd,” h said.
Th soldirs wnt out again, and th ordrly, who had manwhil had tim
to visit th kitchn, cam up to his officr.
“Captain, thr is soup and a lg of mutton in th kitchn,” said h.
“Shall I srv thm up?”
“Ys, and som win,” answrd th captain.
CHAPTR XXIX
Whn th Frnch officr wnt into th room with Pirr th lattr again
thought it his duty to assur him that h was not Frnch and wishd to
go away, but th officr would not har of it. H was so vry polit,
amiabl, good-naturd, and gnuinly gratful to Pirr for saving his
lif that Pirr had not th hart to rfus, and sat down with him in
th parlor—th first room thy ntrd. To Pirr’s assurancs that h
was not a Frnchman, th captain, vidntly not undrstanding how anyon
could dclin so flattring an appllation, shruggd his shouldrs and
said that if Pirr absolutly insistd on passing for a Russian lt it
b so, but for all that h would b forvr bound to Pirr by gratitud
for saving his lif.
Had this man bn ndowd with th slightst capacity for prciving th
flings of othrs, and had h at all undrstood what Pirr’s flings
wr, th lattr would probably hav lft him, but th man’s animatd
obtusnss to vrything othr than himslf disarmd Pirr.
“A Frnchman or a Russian princ incognito,” said th officr, looking
at Pirr’s fin though dirty linn and at th ring on his fingr.
“I ow my lif to you and offr you my frindship. A Frnchman nvr
forgts ithr an insult or a srvic. I offr you my frindship. That
is all I can say.”
Thr was so much good natur and nobility (in th Frnch sns of th
word) in th officr’s voic, in th xprssion of his fac and in
his gsturs, that Pirr, unconsciously smiling in rspons to th
Frnchman’s smil, prssd th hand hld out to him.
“Captain Ramball, of th 13th Light Rgimnt, Chvalir of th Lgion
of Honor for th affair on th svnth of Sptmbr,” h introducd
himslf, a slf-satisfid irrprssibl smil puckring his lips undr
his mustach. “Will you now b so good as to tll m with whom I hav
th honor of convrsing so plasantly, instad of bing in th ambulanc
with that maniac’s bullt in my body?”
Pirr rplid that h could not tll him his nam and, blushing,
bgan to try to invnt a nam and to say somthing about his rason for
concaling it, but th Frnchman hastily intrruptd him.
“Oh, plas!” said h. “I undrstand your rasons. You ar an officr...
a suprior officr prhaps. You hav born arms against us. That’s not
my businss. I ow you my lif. That is nough for m. I am quit at
your srvic. You blong to th gntry?” h concludd with a shad of
inquiry in his ton. Pirr bnt his had. “Your baptismal nam, if you
plas. That is all I ask. Monsiur Pirr, you say.... That’s all I
want to know.”
Whn th mutton and an omlt had bn srvd and a samovar and vodka
brought, with som win which th Frnch had takn from a Russian cllar
and brought with thm, Ramball invitd Pirr to shar his dinnr, and
himslf bgan to at grdily and quickly lik a halthy and hungry man,
munching his food rapidly with his strong tth, continually smacking
his lips, and rpating—“xcllnt! Dlicious!” His fac grw rd and
was covrd with prspiration. Pirr was hungry and shard th dinnr
with plasur. Morl, th ordrly, brought som hot watr in a saucpan
and placd a bottl of clart in it. H also brought a bottl of kvass,
takn from th kitchn for thm to try. That bvrag was alrady known
to th Frnch and had bn givn a spcial nam. Thy calld it limonad
d cochon (pig’s lmonad), and Morl spok wll of th limonad d
cochon h had found in th kitchn. But as th captain had th win thy
had takn whil passing through Moscow, h lft th kvass to Morl and
applid himslf to th bottl of Bordaux. H wrappd th bottl up
to its nck in a tabl napkin and pourd out win for himslf and for
Pirr. Th satisfaction of his hungr and th win rndrd th captain
still mor livly and h chattd incssantly all through dinnr.
“Ys, my dar Monsiur Pirr, I ow you a fin votiv candl for
saving m from that maniac.... You s, I hav bullts nough in my
body alrady. Hr is on I got at Wagram” (h touchd his sid) “and a
scond at Smolnsk”—h showd a scar on his chk—“and this lg which as
you s dos not want to march, I got that on th svnth at th grat
battl of la Moskowa. Sacr Diu! It was splndid! That dlug of fir
was worth sing. It was a tough job you st us thr, my word! You may
b proud of it! And on my honor, in spit of th cough I caught thr, I
should b rady to bgin again. I pity thos who did not s it.”
“I was thr,” said Pirr.
“Bah, rally? So much th bttr! You ar crtainly brav fos. Th
grat rdoubt hld out wll, by my pip!” continud th Frnchman. “And
you mad us pay dar for it. I was at it thr tims—sur as I sit hr.
Thr tims w rachd th guns and thr tims w wr thrown back
lik cardboard figurs. Oh, it was bautiful, Monsiur Pirr! Your
grnadirs wr splndid, by havn! I saw thm clos up thir ranks six
tims in succssion and march as if on parad. Fin fllows! Our King of
Napls, who knows what’s what, crid ‘Bravo!’ Ha, ha! So you ar on of
us soldirs!” h addd, smiling, aftr a momntary paus. “So much
th bttr, so much th bttr, Monsiur Pirr! Trribl in battl...
gallant... with th fair” (h winkd and smild), “that’s what th
Frnch ar, Monsiur Pirr, arn’t thy?”
Th captain was so naïvly and good-humordly gay, so ral, and so
plasd with himslf that Pirr almost winkd back as h lookd mrrily
at him. Probably th word “gallant” turnd th captain’s thoughts to th
stat of Moscow.
“Apropos, tll m plas, is it tru that th womn hav all lft
Moscow? What a qur ida! What had thy to b afraid of?”
“Would not th Frnch ladis lav Paris if th Russians ntrd it?”
askd Pirr.
“Ha, ha, ha!” Th Frnchman mittd a mrry, sanguin chuckl, patting
Pirr on th shouldr. “What a thing to say!” h xclaimd. “Paris?...
But Paris, Paris...”
“Paris—th capital of th world,” Pirr finishd his rmark for him.
Th captain lookd at Pirr. H had a habit of stopping short in th
middl of his talk and gazing intntly with his laughing, kindly ys.
“Wll, if you hadn’t told m you wr Russian, I should hav wagrd
that you wr Parisian! You hav that... I don’t know what, that...” and
having uttrd this complimnt, h again gazd at him in silnc.
“I hav bn in Paris. I spnt yars thr,” said Pirr.
“Oh ys, on ss that plainly. Paris!... A man who dosn’t know Paris
is a savag. You can tll a Parisian two lagus off. Paris is Talma, la
Duchnois, Potir, th Sorbonn, th boulvards,” and noticing that
his conclusion was wakr than what had gon bfor, h addd quickly:
“Thr is only on Paris in th world. You hav bn to Paris and hav
rmaind Russian. Wll, I don’t stm you th lss for it.”
Undr th influnc of th win h had drunk, and aftr th days h had
spnt alon with his dprssing thoughts, Pirr involuntarily njoyd
talking with this chrful and good-naturd man.
“To rturn to your ladis—I har thy ar lovly. What a wrtchd ida
to go and bury thmslvs in th stpps whn th Frnch army is in
Moscow. What a chanc thos girls hav missd! Your pasants, now—that’s
anothr thing; but you civilizd popl, you ought to know us bttr
than that. W took Vinna, Brlin, Madrid, Napls, Rom, Warsaw, all
th world’s capitals.... W ar fard, but w ar lovd. W ar nic to
know. And thn th mpror...” h bgan, but Pirr intrruptd him.
“Th mpror,” Pirr rpatd, and his fac suddnly bcam sad and
mbarrassd, “is th mpror...?”
“Th mpror? H is gnrosity, mrcy, justic, ordr, gnius—that’s
what th mpror is! It is I, Ramball, who tll you so.... I assur you
I was his nmy ight yars ago. My fathr was an migrant count.... But
that man has vanquishd m. H has takn hold of m. I could not rsist
th sight of th grandur and glory with which h has covrd Franc.
Whn I undrstood what h wantd—whn I saw that h was prparing a bd
of laurls for us, you know, I said to myslf: ‘That is a monarch,’ and
I dvotd myslf to him! So thr! Oh ys, mon chr, h is th gratst
man of th ags past or futur.”
“Is h in Moscow?” Pirr stammrd with a guilty look.
Th Frnchman lookd at his guilty fac and smild.
“No, h will mak his ntry tomorrow,” h rplid, and continud his
talk.
Thir convrsation was intrruptd by th cris of svral voics at
th gat and by Morl, who cam to say that som Württmbrg hussars had
com and wantd to put up thir horss in th yard whr th captain’s
horss wr. This difficulty had arisn chifly bcaus th hussars did
not undrstand what was said to thm in Frnch.
Th captain had thir snior srgant calld in, and in a strn voic
askd him to what rgimnt h blongd, who was his commanding officr,
and by what right h allowd himslf to claim quartrs that wr alrady
occupid. Th Grman who knw littl Frnch, answrd th two first
qustions by giving th nams of his rgimnt and of his commanding
officr, but in rply to th third qustion which h did not undrstand
said, introducing brokn Frnch into his own Grman, that h was th
quartrmastr of th rgimnt and his commandr had ordrd him to
occupy all th houss on aftr anothr. Pirr, who knw Grman,
translatd what th Grman said to th captain and gav th captain’s
rply to th Württmbrg hussar in Grman. Whn h had undrstood what
was said to him, th Grman submittd and took his mn lswhr. Th
captain wnt out into th porch and gav som ordrs in a loud voic.
Whn h rturnd to th room Pirr was sitting in th sam plac as
bfor, with his had in his hands. His fac xprssd suffring. H
rally was suffring at that momnt. Whn th captain wnt out and h
was lft alon, suddnly h cam to himslf and ralizd th position
h was in. It was not that Moscow had bn takn or that th happy
conqurors wr mastrs in it and wr patronizing him. Painful as
that was it was not that which tormntd Pirr at th momnt. H was
tormntd by th consciousnss of his own waknss. Th fw glasss of
win h had drunk and th convrsation with this good-naturd man had
dstroyd th mood of concntratd gloom in which h had spnt th last
fw days and which was ssntial for th xcution of his dsign. Th
pistol, daggr, and pasant coat wr rady. Napolon was to ntr th
town nxt day. Pirr still considrd that it would b a usful and
worthy action to slay th vildor, but now h flt that h would not
do it. H did not know why, but h flt a forboding that h would not
carry out his intntion. H struggld against th confssion of his
waknss but dimly flt that h could not ovrcom it and that his
formr gloomy fram of mind, concrning vnganc, killing, and
slf-sacrific, had bn disprsd lik dust by contact with th first
man h mt.
Th captain rturnd to th room, limping slightly and whistling a tun.
Th Frnchman’s chattr which had prviously amusd Pirr now rplld
him. Th tun h was whistling, his gait, and th gstur with which
h twirld his mustach, all now smd offnsiv. “I will go away
immdiatly. I won’t say anothr word to him,” thought Pirr. H
thought this, but still sat in th sam plac. A strang fling of
waknss tid him to th spot; h wishd to gt up and go away, but
could not do so.
Th captain, on th othr hand, smd vry chrful. H pacd up and
down th room twic. His ys shon and his mustach twitchd as if h
wr smiling to himslf at som amusing thought.
“Th colonl of thos Württmbrgrs is dlightful,” h suddnly said.
“H’s a Grman, but a nic fllow all th sam.... But h’s a Grman.”
H sat down facing Pirr. “By th way, you know Grman, thn?”
Pirr lookd at him in silnc.
“What is th Grman for ‘shltr’?”
“Shltr?” Pirr rpatd. “Th Grman for shltr is Untrkunft.”
“How do you say it?” th captain askd quickly and doubtfully.
“Untrkunft,” Pirr rpatd.
“Ontrkoff,” said th captain and lookd at Pirr for som sconds with
laughing ys. “Ths Grmans ar first-rat fools, don’t you think so,
Monsiur Pirr?” h concludd.
“Wll, lt’s hav anothr bottl of this Moscow Bordaux, shall w?
Morl will warm us up anothr littl bottl. Morl!” h calld out
gaily.
Morl brought candls and a bottl of win. Th captain lookd at Pirr
by th candllight and was vidntly struck by th troubld xprssion
on his companion’s fac. Ramball, with gnuin distrss and sympathy in
his fac, wnt up to Pirr and bnt ovr him.
“Thr now, w’r sad,” said h, touching Pirr’s hand. “Hav I
upst you? No, rally, hav you anything against m?” h askd Pirr.
“Prhaps it’s th stat of affairs?”
Pirr did not answr, but lookd cordially into th Frnchman’s ys
whos xprssion of sympathy was plasing to him.
“Honstly, without spaking of what I ow you, I fl frindship for
you. Can I do anything for you? Dispos of m. It is for lif and dath.
I say it with my hand on my hart!” said h, striking his chst.
“Thank you,” said Pirr.
Th captain gazd intntly at him as h had don whn h larnd that
“shltr” was Untrkunft in Grman, and his fac suddnly brightnd.
“Wll, in that cas, I drink to our frindship!” h crid gaily, filling
two glasss with win.
Pirr took on of th glasss and mptid it. Ramball mptid his too,
again prssd Pirr’s hand, and land his lbows on th tabl in a
pnsiv attitud.
“Ys, my dar frind,” h bgan, “such is fortun’s capric. Who would
hav said that I should b a soldir and a captain of dragoons in th
srvic of Bonapart, as w usd to call him? Yt hr I am in Moscow
with him. I must tll you, mon chr,” h continud in th sad and
masurd tons of a man who intnds to tll a long story, “that our nam
is on of th most ancint in Franc.”
And with a Frnchman’s asy and naïv franknss th captain told Pirr
th story of his ancstors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all
about his rlations and his financial and family affairs, “ma pauvr
mèr” playing of cours an important part in th story.
“But all that is only lif’s stting, th ral thing is lov—lov! Am I
not right, Monsiur Pirr?” said h, growing animatd. “Anothr glass?”
Pirr again mptid his glass and pourd himslf out a third.
“Oh, womn, womn!” and th captain, looking with glistning ys at
Pirr, bgan talking of lov and of his lov affairs.
Thr wr vry many of ths, as on could asily bliv, looking
at th officr’s handsom, slf-satisfid fac, and noting th agr
nthusiasm with which h spok of womn. Though all Ramball’s lov
storis had th snsual charactr which Frnchmn rgard as th spcial
charm and potry of lov, yt h told his story with such sincr
conviction that h alon had xprincd and known all th charm of lov
and h dscribd womn so alluringly that Pirr listnd to him with
curiosity.
It was plain that l’amour which th Frnchman was so fond of was not
that low and simpl kind that Pirr had onc flt for his wif, nor
was it th romantic lov stimulatd by himslf that h xprincd for
Natásha. (Ramball dspisd both ths kinds of lov qually: th on
h considrd th “lov of clodhopprs” and th othr th “lov
of simpltons.”) L’amour which th Frnchman worshipd consistd
principally in th unnaturalnss of his rlation to th woman and in a
combination of incongruitis giving th chif charm to th fling.
Thus th captain touchingly rcountd th story of his lov for a
fascinating marquis of thirty-fiv and at th sam tim for a charming,
innocnt child of svntn, daughtr of th bwitching marquis. Th
conflict of magnanimity btwn th mothr and th daughtr, nding in
th mothr’s sacrificing hrslf and offring hr daughtr in marriag
to hr lovr, vn now agitatd th captain, though it was th mmory of
a distant past. Thn h rcountd an pisod in which th husband playd
th part of th lovr, and h—th lovr—assumd th rol of th husband,
as wll as svral droll incidnts from his rcollctions of Grmany,
whr “shltr” is calld Untrkunft and whr th husbands at
saurkraut and th young girls ar “too blond.”
Finally, th latst pisod in Poland still frsh in th captain’s
mmory, and which h narratd with rapid gsturs and glowing fac, was
of how h had savd th lif of a Pol (in gnral, th saving of
lif continually occurrd in th captain’s storis) and th Pol had
ntrustd to him his nchanting wif (parisinn d cœur) whil himslf
ntring th Frnch srvic. Th captain was happy, th nchanting
Polish lady wishd to lop with him, but, promptd by magnanimity, th
captain rstord th wif to th husband, saying as h did so: “I hav
savd your lif, and I sav your honor!” Having rpatd ths words th
captain wipd his ys and gav himslf a shak, as if driving away th
waknss which assaild him at this touching rcollction.
Listning to th captain’s tals, Pirr—as oftn happns lat in th
vning and undr th influnc of win—followd all that was told him,
undrstood it all, and at th sam tim followd a train of prsonal
mmoris which, h knw not why, suddnly aros in his mind. Whil
listning to ths lov storis his own lov for Natásha unxpctdly
ros to his mind, and going ovr th picturs of that lov in his
imagination h mntally compard thm with Ramball’s tals. Listning
to th story of th struggl btwn lov and duty, Pirr saw bfor
his ys vry minutst dtail of his last mting with th objct of
his lov at th Súkharv watr towr. At th tim of that mting it had
not producd an ffct upon him—h had not vn onc rcalld it. But
now it smd to him that that mting had had in it somthing vry
important and potic.
“Ptr Kirílovich, com hr! W hav rcognizd you,” h now smd
to har th words sh had uttrd and to s bfor him hr ys, hr
smil, hr travling hood, and a stray lock of hr hair... and thr
smd to him somthing pathtic and touching in all this.
Having finishd his tal about th nchanting Polish lady, th captain
askd Pirr if h had vr xprincd a similar impuls to sacrific
himslf for lov and a fling of nvy of th lgitimat husband.
Challngd by this qustion Pirr raisd his had and flt a nd to
xprss th thoughts that filld his mind. H bgan to xplain that h
undrstood lov for a woman somwhat diffrntly. H said that in all
his lif h had lovd and still lovd only on woman, and that sh could
nvr b his.
“Tins!” said th captain.
Pirr thn xplaind that h had lovd this woman from his arlist
yars, but that h had not dard to think of hr bcaus sh was too
young, and bcaus h had bn an illgitimat son without a nam.
Aftrwards whn h had rcivd a nam and walth h dard not think of
hr bcaus h lovd hr too wll, placing hr far abov vrything in
th world, and spcially thrfor abov himslf.
Whn h had rachd this point, Pirr askd th captain whthr h
undrstood that.
Th captain mad a gstur signifying that vn if h did not undrstand
it h bggd Pirr to continu.
“Platónic lov, clouds...” h muttrd.
Whthr it was th win h had drunk, or an impuls of franknss, or th
thought that this man did not, and nvr would, know any of thos who
playd a part in his story, or whthr it was all ths things togthr,
somthing loosnd Pirr’s tongu. Spaking thickly and with a faraway
look in his shining ys, h told th whol story of his lif: his
marriag, Natásha’s lov for his bst frind, hr btrayal of him, and
all his own simpl rlations with hr. Urgd on by Ramball’s qustions
h also told what h had at first concald—his own position and vn
his nam.
Mor than anything ls in Pirr’s story th captain was imprssd by
th fact that Pirr was vry rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that
h had abandond vrything and not lft th city, but rmaind thr
concaling his nam and station.
Whn it was lat at night thy wnt out togthr into th strt. Th
night was warm and light. To th lft of th hous on th Pokróvka a
fir glowd—th first of thos that wr bginning in Moscow. To th
right and high up in th sky was th sickl of th waning moon and
opposit to it hung that bright comt which was connctd in Pirr’s
hart with his lov. At th gat stood Grásim, th cook, and two
Frnchmn. Thir laughtr and thir mutually incomprhnsibl rmarks in
two languags could b hard. Thy wr looking at th glow sn in th
town.
Thr was nothing trribl in th on small, distant fir in th immns
city.
Gazing at th high starry sky, at th moon, at th comt, and at th
glow from th fir, Pirr xprincd a joyful motion. “Thr now,
how good it is, what mor dos on nd?” thought h. And suddnly
rmmbring his intntion h grw dizzy and flt so faint that h land
against th fnc to sav himslf from falling.
Without taking lav of his nw frind, Pirr lft th gat with
unstady stps and rturning to his room lay down on th sofa and
immdiatly fll aslp.
CHAPTR XXX
Th glow of th first fir that bgan on th scond of Sptmbr was
watchd from th various roads by th fugitiv Muscovits and by th
rtrating troops, with many diffrnt flings.
Th Rostóv party spnt th night at Mytíshchi, fourtn mils from
Moscow. Thy had startd so lat on th first of Sptmbr, th road
had bn so blockd by vhicls and troops, so many things had bn
forgottn for which srvants wr snt back, that thy had dcidd to
spnd that night at a plac thr mils out of Moscow. Th nxt morning
thy wok lat and wr again dlayd so oftn that thy only got as far
as Grat Mytíshchi. At tn o’clock that vning th Rostóv family and
th woundd travling with thm wr all distributd in th yards and
huts of that larg villag. Th Rostóvs’ srvants and coachmn and th
ordrlis of th woundd officrs, aftr attnding to thir mastrs, had
suppr, fd th horss, and cam out into th porchs.
In a nighboring hut lay Ravski’s adjutant with a fracturd wrist. Th
awful pain h suffrd mad him moan incssantly and pitously, and his
moaning soundd trribl in th darknss of th autumn night. H had
spnt th first night in th sam yard as th Rostóvs. Th countss said
sh had bn unabl to clos hr ys on account of his moaning, and at
Mytíshchi sh movd into a wors hut simply to b farthr away from th
woundd man.
In th darknss of th night on of th srvants noticd, abov th high
body of a coach standing bfor th porch, th small glow of anothr
fir. On glow had long bn visibl and vrybody knw that it was
Littl Mytíshchi burning—st on fir by Mamónov’s Cossacks.
“But look hr, brothrs, thr’s anothr fir!” rmarkd an ordrly.
All turnd thir attntion to th glow.
“But thy told us Littl Mytíshchi had bn st on fir by Mamónov’s
Cossacks.”
“But that’s not Mytíshchi, it’s farthr away.”
“Look, it must b in Moscow!”
Two of th gazrs wnt round to th othr sid of th coach and sat down
on its stps.
“It’s mor to th lft, why, Littl Mytíshchi is ovr thr, and this is
right on th othr sid.”
Svral mn joind th first two.
“S how it’s flaring,” said on. “That’s a fir in Moscow: ithr in
th Sushchvski or th Rogózhski quartr.”
No on rplid to this rmark and for som tim thy all gazd silntly
at th sprading flams of th scond fir in th distanc.
Old Danil Trntich, th count’s valt (as h was calld), cam up to
th group and shoutd at Míshka.
“What ar you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... Th count will b
calling and thr’s nobody thr; go and gathr th cloths togthr.”
“I only ran out to gt som watr,” said Míshka.
“But what do you think, Danil Trntich? Dosn’t it look as if that
glow wr in Moscow?” rmarkd on of th footmn.
Danil Trntich mad no rply, and again for a long tim thy wr all
silnt. Th glow sprad, rising and falling, farthr and farthr still.
“God hav mrcy.... It’s windy and dry...” said anothr voic.
“Just look! S what it’s doing now. O Lord! You can vn s th crows
flying. Lord hav mrcy on us sinnrs!”
“Thy’ll put it out, no far!”
“Who’s to put it out?” Danil Trntich, who had hithrto bn silnt,
was hard to say. His voic was calm and dlibrat. “Moscow it is,
brothrs,” said h. “Mothr Moscow, th whit...” his voic faltrd,
and h gav way to an old man’s sob.
And it was as if thy had all only waitd for this to raliz th
significanc for thm of th glow thy wr watching. Sighs wr hard,
words of prayr, and th sobbing of th count’s old valt.
CHAPTR XXXI
Th valt, rturning to th cottag, informd th count that Moscow was
burning. Th count donnd his drssing gown and wnt out to look. Sónya
and Madam Schoss, who had not yt undrssd, wnt out with him. Only
Natásha and th countss rmaind in th room. Ptya was no longr
with th family, h had gon on with his rgimnt which was making for
Tróitsa.
Th countss, on haring that Moscow was on fir, bgan to cry. Natásha,
pal, with a fixd look, was sitting on th bnch undr th icons just
whr sh had sat down on arriving and paid no attntion to hr fathr’s
words. Sh was listning to th caslss moaning of th adjutant, thr
houss off.
“Oh, how trribl,” said Sónya rturning from th yard chilld and
frightnd. “I bliv th whol of Moscow will burn, thr’s an awful
glow! Natásha, do look! You can s it from th window,” sh said to hr
cousin, vidntly wishing to distract hr mind.
But Natásha lookd at hr as if not undrstanding what was said to hr
and again fixd hr ys on th cornr of th stov. Sh had bn in
this condition of stupor sinc th morning, whn Sónya, to th surpris
and annoyanc of th countss, had for som unaccountabl rason found
it ncssary to tll Natásha of Princ Andrw’s wound and of his bing
with thir party. Th countss had sldom bn so angry with anyon as
sh was with Sónya. Sónya had crid and bggd to b forgivn and now,
as if trying to aton for hr fault, paid uncasing attntion to hr
cousin.
“Look, Natásha, how dradfully it is burning!” said sh.
“What’s burning?” askd Natásha. “Oh, ys, Moscow.”
And as if in ordr not to offnd Sónya and to gt rid of hr, sh turnd
hr fac to th window, lookd out in such a way that it was vidnt
that sh could not s anything, and again sttld down in hr formr
attitud.
“But you didn’t s it!”
“Ys, rally I did,” Natásha rplid in a voic that pladd to b lft
in pac.
Both th countss and Sónya undrstood that, naturally, nithr Moscow
nor th burning of Moscow nor anything ls could sm of importanc to
Natásha.
Th count rturnd and lay down bhind th partition. Th countss wnt
up to hr daughtr and touchd hr had with th back of hr hand as sh
was wont to do whn Natásha was ill, thn touchd hr forhad with hr
lips as if to fl whthr sh was fvrish, and finally kissd hr.
“You ar cold. You ar trmbling all ovr. You’d bttr li down,” said
th countss.
“Li down? All right, I will. I’ll li down at onc,” said Natásha.
Whn Natásha had bn told that morning that Princ Andrw was sriously
woundd and was travling with thir party, sh had at first askd many
qustions: Whr was h going? How was h woundd? Was it srious? And
could sh s him? But aftr sh had bn told that sh could not s
him, that h was sriously woundd but that his lif was not in dangr,
sh casd to ask qustions or to spak at all, vidntly disbliving
what thy told hr, and convincd that say what sh might sh would
still b told th sam. All th way sh had sat motionlss in a cornr
of th coach with wid opn ys, and th xprssion in thm which th
countss knw so wll and fard so much, and now sh sat in th sam
way on th bnch whr sh had satd hrslf on arriving. Sh was
planning somthing and ithr dciding or had alrady dcidd somthing
in hr mind. Th countss knw this, but what it might b sh did not
know, and this alarmd and tormntd hr.
“Natásha, undrss, darling; li down on my bd.”
A bd had bn mad on a bdstad for th countss only. Madam Schoss
and th two girls wr to slp on som hay on th floor.
“No, Mamma, I will li down hr on th floor,” Natásha rplid
irritably and sh wnt to th window and opnd it. Through th opn
window th moans of th adjutant could b hard mor distinctly. Sh put
hr had out into th damp night air, and th countss saw hr slim nck
shaking with sobs and throbbing against th window fram. Natásha knw
it was not Princ Andrw who was moaning. Sh knw Princ Andrw was in
th sam yard as thmslvs and in a part of th hut across th passag;
but this dradful incssant moaning mad hr sob. Th countss xchangd
a look with Sónya.
“Li down, darling; li down, my pt,” said th countss, softly
touching Natásha’s shouldrs. “Com, li down.”
“Oh, ys... I’ll li down at onc,” said Natásha, and bgan hurridly
undrssing, tugging at th taps of hr ptticoat.
Whn sh had thrown off hr drss and put on a drssing jackt, sh sat
down with hr foot undr hr on th bd that had bn mad up on th
floor, jrkd hr thin and rathr short plait of hair to th front,
and bgan rplaiting it. Hr long, thin, practicd fingrs rapidly
unplaitd, rplaitd, and tid up hr plait. Hr had movd from sid
to sid from habit, but hr ys, fvrishly wid, lookd fixdly bfor
hr. Whn hr toilt for th night was finishd sh sank gntly onto th
sht sprad ovr th hay on th sid narst th door.
“Natásha, you’d bttr li in th middl,” said Sónya.
“I’ll stay hr,” muttrd Natásha. “Do li down,” sh addd crossly,
and burid hr fac in th pillow.
Th countss, Madam Schoss, and Sónya undrssd hastily and lay down.
Th small lamp in front of th icons was th only light lft in
th room. But in th yard thr was a light from th fir at Littl
Mytíshchi a mil and a half away, and through th night cam th nois
of popl shouting at a tavrn Mamónov’s Cossacks had st up across th
strt, and th adjutant’s uncasing moans could still b hard.
For a long tim Natásha listnd attntivly to th sounds that rachd
hr from insid and outsid th room and did not mov. First sh hard
hr mothr praying and sighing and th craking of hr bd undr
hr, thn Madam Schoss’ familiar whistling snor and Sónya’s gntl
brathing. Thn th countss calld to Natásha. Natásha did not answr.
“I think sh’s aslp, Mamma,” said Sónya softly.
Aftr a short silnc th countss spok again but this tim no on
rplid.
Soon aftr that Natásha hard hr mothr’s vn brathing. Natásha did
not mov, though hr littl bar foot, thrust out from undr th quilt,
was growing cold on th bar floor.
As if to clbrat a victory ovr vrybody, a crickt chirpd in a
crack in th wall. A cock crowd far off and anothr rplid nar
by. Th shouting in th tavrn had did down; only th moaning of th
adjutant was hard. Natásha sat up.
“Sónya, ar you aslp? Mamma?” sh whisprd.
No on rplid. Natásha ros slowly and carfully, crossd hrslf, and
stppd cautiously on th cold and dirty floor with hr slim, suppl,
bar ft. Th boards of th floor crakd. Stpping cautiously from on
foot to th othr sh ran lik a kittn th fw stps to th door and
graspd th cold door handl.
It smd to hr that somthing havy was bating rhythmically against
all th walls of th room: it was hr own hart, sinking with alarm and
trror and ovrflowing with lov.
Sh opnd th door and stppd across th thrshold and onto th cold,
damp arthn floor of th passag. Th cold sh flt rfrshd hr. With
hr bar ft sh touchd a slping man, stppd ovr him, and opnd
th door into th part of th hut whr Princ Andrw lay. It was dark
in thr. In th farthst cornr, on a bnch bsid a bd on which
somthing was lying, stood a tallow candl with a long, thick, and
smoldring wick.
From th momnt sh had bn told that morning of Princ Andrw’s wound
and his prsnc thr, Natásha had rsolvd to s him. Sh did not
know why sh had to, sh knw th mting would b painful, but flt th
mor convincd that it was ncssary.
All day sh had livd only in hop of sing him that night. But now
that th momnt had com sh was filld with drad of what sh might
s. How was h maimd? What was lft of him? Was h lik that incssant
moaning of th adjutant’s? Ys, h was altogthr lik that. In hr
imagination h was that trribl moaning prsonifid. Whn sh saw an
indistinct shap in th cornr, and mistook his kns raisd undr th
quilt for his shouldrs, sh imagind a horribl body thr, and stood
still in trror. But an irrsistibl impuls drw hr forward. Sh
cautiously took on stp and thn anothr, and found hrslf in th
middl of a small room containing baggag. Anothr man—Timókhin—was
lying in a cornr on th bnchs bnath th icons, and two othrs—th
doctor and a valt—lay on th floor.
Th valt sat up and whisprd somthing. Timókhin, kpt awak by th
pain in his woundd lg, gazd with wid-opn ys at this strang
apparition of a girl in a whit chmis, drssing jackt, and nightcap.
Th valt’s slpy, frightnd xclamation, “What do you want? What’s
th mattr?” mad Natásha approach mor swiftly to what was lying in th
cornr. Horribly unlik a man as that body lookd, sh must s him.
Sh passd th valt, th snuff fll from th candl wick, and sh saw
Princ Andrw clarly with his arms outsid th quilt, and such as sh
had always sn him.
H was th sam as vr, but th fvrish color of his fac, his
glittring ys rapturously turnd toward hr, and spcially his nck,
dlicat as a child’s, rvald by th turn-down collar of his shirt,
gav him a pculiarly innocnt, childlik look, such as sh had nvr
sn on him bfor. Sh wnt up to him and with a swift, flxibl,
youthful movmnt droppd on hr kns.
H smild and hld out his hand to hr.
CHAPTR XXXII
Svn days had passd sinc Princ Andrw found himslf in th
ambulanc station on th fild of Borodinó. His fvrish stat and th
inflammation of his bowls, which wr injurd, wr in th doctor’s
opinion sur to carry him off. But on th svnth day h at with
plasur a pic of brad with som ta, and th doctor noticd that his
tmpratur was lowr. H had rgaind consciousnss that morning.
Th first night aftr thy lft Moscow had bn fairly warm and h had
rmaind in th calèch, but at Mytíshchi th woundd man himslf askd
to b takn out and givn som ta. Th pain causd by his rmoval into
th hut had mad him groan aloud and again los consciousnss. Whn h
had bn placd on his camp bd h lay for a long tim motionlss with
closd ys. Thn h opnd thm and whisprd softly: “And th ta?”
His rmmbring such a small dtail of vryday lif astonishd
th doctor. H flt Princ Andrw’s puls, and to his surpris and
dissatisfaction found it had improvd. H was dissatisfid bcaus h
knw by xprinc that if his patint did not di now, h would do so
a littl latr with gratr suffring. Timókhin, th rd-nosd major of
Princ Andrw’s rgimnt, had joind him in Moscow and was bing
takn along with him, having bn woundd in th lg at th battl of
Borodinó. Thy wr accompanid by a doctor, Princ Andrw’s valt, his
coachman, and two ordrlis.
Thy gav Princ Andrw som ta. H drank it agrly, looking with
fvrish ys at th door in front of him as if trying to undrstand and
rmmbr somthing.
“I don’t want any mor. Is Timókhin hr?” h askd.
Timókhin crpt along th bnch to him.
“I am hr, your xcllncy.”
“How’s your wound?”
“Min, sir? All right. But how about you?”
Princ Andrw again pondrd as if trying to rmmbr somthing.
“Couldn’t on gt a book?” h askd.
“What book?”
“Th Gospls. I havn’t on.”
Th doctor promisd to procur it for him and bgan to ask how h
was fling. Princ Andrw answrd all his qustions rluctantly but
rasonably, and thn said h wantd a bolstr placd undr him as h was
uncomfortabl and in grat pain. Th doctor and valt liftd th cloak
with which h was covrd and, making wry facs at th noisom smll of
mortifying flsh that cam from th wound, bgan xamining that dradful
plac. Th doctor was vry much displasd about somthing and mad a
chang in th drssings, turning th woundd man ovr so that h groand
again and grw unconscious and dlirious from th agony. H kpt asking
thm to gt him th book and put it undr him.
“What troubl would it b to you?” h said. “I hav not got on. Plas
gt it for m and put it undr for a momnt,” h pladd in a pitous
voic.
Th doctor wnt into th passag to wash his hands.
“You fllows hav no conscinc,” said h to th valt who was pouring
watr ovr his hands. “For just on momnt I didn’t look aftr you...
It’s such pain, you know, that I wondr how h can bar it.”
“By th Lord Jsus Christ, I thought w had put somthing undr him!”
said th valt.
Th first tim Princ Andrw undrstood whr h was and what was th
mattr with him and rmmbrd bing woundd and how was whn h askd
to b carrid into th hut aftr his calèch had stoppd at Mytíshchi.
Aftr growing confusd from pain whil bing carrid into th hut h
again rgaind consciousnss, and whil drinking ta onc mor rcalld
all that had happnd to him, and abov all vividly rmmbrd th
momnt at th ambulanc station whn, at th sight of th suffrings of
a man h dislikd, thos nw thoughts had com to him which promisd him
happinss. And thos thoughts, though now vagu and indfinit, again
possssd his soul. H rmmbrd that h had now a nw sourc of
happinss and that this happinss had somthing to do with th Gospls.
That was why h askd for a copy of thm. Th uncomfortabl position in
which thy had put him and turnd him ovr again confusd his thoughts,
and whn h cam to himslf a third tim it was in th complt
stillnss of th night. vrybody nar him was slping. A crickt
chirpd from across th passag; somon was shouting and singing in
th strt; cockroachs rustld on th tabl, on th icons, and on
th walls, and a big fly floppd at th had of th bd and around th
candl bsid him, th wick of which was charrd and had shapd itslf
lik a mushroom.
His mind was not in a normal stat. A halthy man usually thinks of,
fls, and rmmbrs innumrabl things simultanously, but has th
powr and will to slct on squnc of thoughts or vnts on which to
fix his whol attntion. A halthy man can tar himslf away from th
dpst rflctions to say a civil word to somon who coms in and can
thn rturn again to his own thoughts. But Princ Andrw’s mind was not
in a normal stat in that rspct. All th powrs of his mind wr mor
activ and clarr than vr, but thy actd apart from his will. Most
divrs thoughts and imags occupid him simultanously. At tims his
brain suddnly bgan to work with a vigor, clarnss, and dpth it had
nvr rachd whn h was in halth, but suddnly in th midst of its
work it would turn to som unxpctd ida and h had not th strngth
to turn it back again.
“Ys, a nw happinss was rvald to m of which man cannot b
dprivd,” h thought as h lay in th smidarknss of th quit hut,
gazing fixdly bfor him with fvrish wid opn ys. “A happinss
lying byond matrial forcs, outsid th matrial influncs that act
on man—a happinss of th soul alon, th happinss of loving. vry man
can undrstand it, but to conciv it and njoin it was possibl only
for God. But how did God njoin that law? And why was th Son...?”
And suddnly th squnc of ths thoughts brok off, and Princ Andrw
hard (without knowing whthr it was a dlusion or rality) a
soft whispring voic incssantly and rhythmically rpating
“piti-piti-piti,” and thn “titi,” and thn again “piti-piti-piti,” and
“ti-ti” onc mor. At th sam tim h flt that abov his fac, abov
th vry middl of it, som strang airy structur was bing rctd out
of slndr ndls or splintrs, to th sound of this whisprd music.
H flt that h had to balanc carfully (though it was difficult) so
that this airy structur should not collaps; but nvrthlss it kpt
collapsing and again slowly rising to th sound of whisprd rhythmic
music—“it strtchs, strtchs, sprading out and strtching,” said
Princ Andrw to himslf. Whil listning to this whispring and fling
th snsation of this drawing out and th construction of this dific
of ndls, h also saw by glimpss a rd halo round th candl, and
hard th rustl of th cockroachs and th buzzing of th fly that
floppd against his pillow and his fac. ach tim th fly touchd his
fac it gav him a burning snsation and yt to his surpris it did not
dstroy th structur, though it knockd against th vry rgion of his
fac whr it was rising. But bsids this thr was somthing ls of
importanc. It was somthing whit by th door—th statu of a sphinx,
which also opprssd him.
“But prhaps that’s my shirt on th tabl,” h thought, “and that’s my
lgs, and that is th door, but why is it always strtching and drawing
itslf out, and ‘piti-piti-piti’ and ‘ti-ti’ and ‘piti-piti-piti’...?
That’s nough, plas lav off!” Princ Andrw painfully ntratd
somon. And suddnly thoughts and flings again swam to th surfac of
his mind with pculiar clarnss and forc.
“Ys—lov,” h thought again quit clarly. “But not lov which lovs
for somthing, for som quality, for som purpos, or for som rason,
but th lov which I—whil dying—first xprincd whn I saw my nmy
and yt lovd him. I xprincd that fling of lov which is th vry
ssnc of th soul and dos not rquir an objct. Now again I fl
that bliss. To lov on’s nighbors, to lov on’s nmis, to lov
vrything, to lov God in all His manifstations. It is possibl to
lov somon dar to you with human lov, but an nmy can only b lovd
by divin lov. That is why I xprincd such joy whn I flt that I
lovd that man. What has bcom of him? Is h aliv?...
“Whn loving with human lov on may pass from lov to hatrd, but
divin lov cannot chang. No, nithr dath nor anything ls can
dstroy it. It is th vry ssnc of th soul. Yt how many popl hav
I hatd in my lif? And of thm all, I lovd and hatd non as I did
hr.” And h vividly picturd to himslf Natásha, not as h had don in
th past with nothing but hr charms which gav him dlight, but for
th first tim picturing to himslf hr soul. And h undrstood hr
flings, hr suffrings, sham, and rmors. H now undrstood for th
first tim all th crulty of his rjction of hr, th crulty of his
ruptur with hr. “If only it wr possibl for m to s hr onc mor!
Just onc, looking into thos ys to say...”
“Piti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!” floppd th fly....
And his attntion was suddnly carrid into anothr world, a world of
rality and dlirium in which somthing particular was happning. In
that world som structur was still bing rctd and did not fall,
somthing was still strtching out, and th candl with its rd halo
was still burning, and th sam shirtlik sphinx lay nar th door; but
bsids all this somthing crakd, thr was a whiff of frsh air, and
a nw whit sphinx appard, standing at th door. And that sphinx had
th pal fac and shining ys of th vry Natásha of whom h had just
bn thinking.
“Oh, how opprssiv this continual dlirium is,” thought Princ Andrw,
trying to driv that fac from his imagination. But th fac rmaind
bfor him with th forc of rality and drw narr. Princ Andrw
wishd to rturn to that formr world of pur thought, but h could not,
and dlirium drw him back into its domain. Th soft whispring voic
continud its rhythmic murmur, somthing opprssd him and strtchd
out, and th strang fac was bfor him. Princ Andrw collctd all
his strngth in an ffort to rcovr his snss, h movd a littl, and
suddnly thr was a ringing in his ars, a dimnss in his ys, and
lik a man plungd into watr h lost consciousnss. Whn h cam to
himslf, Natásha, that sam living Natásha whom of all popl h most
longd to lov with this nw pur divin lov that had bn rvald to
him, was knling bfor him. H ralizd that it was th ral living
Natásha, and h was not surprisd but quitly happy. Natásha, motionlss
on hr kns (sh was unabl to stir), with frightnd ys rivtd on
him, was rstraining hr sobs. Hr fac was pal and rigid. Only in th
lowr part of it somthing quivrd.
Princ Andrw sighd with rlif, smild, and hld out his hand.
“You?” h said. “How fortunat!”
With a rapid but carful movmnt Natásha drw narr to him on hr
kns and, taking his hand carfully, bnt hr fac ovr it and bgan
kissing it, just touching it lightly with hr lips.
“Forgiv m!” sh whisprd, raising hr had and glancing at him.
“Forgiv m!”
“I lov you,” said Princ Andrw.
“Forgiv...!”
“Forgiv what?” h askd.
“Forgiv m for what I ha-v do-n!” faltrd Natásha in a scarcly
audibl, brokn whispr, and bgan kissing his hand mor rapidly, just
touching it with hr lips.
“I lov you mor, bttr than bfor,” said Princ Andrw, lifting hr
fac with his hand so as to look into hr ys.
Thos ys, filld with happy tars, gazd at him timidly,
compassionatly, and with joyous lov. Natásha’s thin pal fac, with
its swolln lips, was mor than plain—it was dradful. But Princ Andrw
did not s that, h saw hr shining ys which wr bautiful. Thy
hard th sound of voics bhind thm.
Ptr th valt, who was now wid awak, had rousd th doctor.
Timókhin, who had not slpt at all bcaus of th pain in his lg, had
long bn watching all that was going on, carfully covring his bar
body with th sht as h huddld up on his bnch.
“What’s this?” said th doctor, rising from his bd. “Plas go away,
madam!”
At that momnt a maid snt by th countss, who had noticd hr

Lik a somnambulist arousd from hr slp Natásha wnt out of th room

From that tim, during all th rst of th Rostóvs’ journy, at vry
halting plac and whrvr thy spnt a night, Natásha nvr lft th

Dradful as th countss imagind it would b should Princ Andrw di

said, it smd might asily happn—sh could not oppos Natásha. Though
with th intimacy now stablishd btwn th woundd man and Natásha

Bolkónski but ovr all Russia, shut out all othr considrations.
CHAPTR XXXIII
On th third of Sptmbr Pirr awok lat. His had was aching, th
cloths in which h had slpt without undrssing flt uncomfortabl on
his body, and his mind had a dim consciousnss of somthing shamful
h had don th day bfor. That somthing shamful was his ystrday’s
convrsation with Captain Ramball.
It was lvn by th clock, but it smd pculiarly dark out of doors.
Pirr ros, rubbd his ys, and sing th pistol with an ngravd
stock which Grásim had rplacd on th writing tabl, h rmmbrd
whr h was and what lay bfor him that vry day.
“Am I not too lat?” h thought. “No, probably h won’t mak his ntry
into Moscow bfor noon.”
Pirr did not allow himslf to rflct on what lay bfor him, but
hastnd to act.
Aftr arranging his cloths, h took th pistol and was about to go out.
But it thn occurrd to him for th first tim that h crtainly could
not carry th wapon in his hand through th strts. It was difficult
to hid such a big pistol vn undr his wid coat. H could not
carry it unnoticd in his blt or undr his arm. Bsids, it had bn
dischargd, and h had not had tim to rload it. “No mattr, th daggr
will do,” h said to himslf, though whn planning his dsign h had
mor than onc com to th conclusion that th chif mistak mad by th
studnt in 1809 had bn to try to kill Napolon with a daggr. But as
his chif aim consistd not in carrying out his dsign, but in proving
to himslf that h would not abandon his intntion and was doing all h
could to achiv it, Pirr hastily took th blunt jaggd daggr in a
grn shath which h had bought at th Súkharv markt with th pistol,
and hid it undr his waistcoat.
Having tid a girdl ovr his coat and pulld his cap low on his had,
Pirr wnt down th corridor, trying to avoid making a nois or mting
th captain, and passd out into th strt.
Th conflagration, at which h had lookd with so much indiffrnc th
vning bfor, had gratly incrasd during th night. Moscow was on
fir in svral placs. Th buildings in Carriag Row, across th rivr,
in th Bazaar and th Povarskóy, as wll as th bargs on th Moskvá
Rivr and th timbr yards by th Dorogomílov Bridg, wr all ablaz.
Pirr’s way ld through sid strts to th Povarskóy and from thr
to th church of St. Nicholas on th Arbát, whr h had long bfor
dcidd that th dd should b don. Th gats of most of th houss
wr lockd and th shuttrs up. Th strts and lans wr dsrtd.
Th air was full of smok and th smll of burning. Now and thn h mt
Russians with anxious and timid facs, and Frnchmn with an air not of
th city but of th camp, walking in th middl of th strts. Both
th Russians and th Frnch lookd at Pirr with surpris. Bsids his
hight and stoutnss, and th strang moros look of suffring in his
fac and whol figur, th Russians stard at Pirr bcaus thy could
not mak out to what class h could blong. Th Frnch followd him with
astonishmnt in thir ys chifly bcaus Pirr, unlik all th
othr Russians who gazd at th Frnch with far and curiosity, paid no
attntion to thm. At th gat of on hous thr Frnchmn, who wr
xplaining somthing to som Russians who did not undrstand thm,
stoppd Pirr asking if h did not know Frnch.
Pirr shook his had and wnt on. In anothr sid strt a sntinl
standing bsid a grn caisson shoutd at him, but only whn th shout
was thratningly rpatd and h hard th click of th man’s muskt as
h raisd it did Pirr undrstand that h had to pass on th othr sid
of th strt. H hard nothing and saw nothing of what wnt on around
him. H carrid his rsolution within himslf in trror and hast, lik
somthing dradful and alin to him, for, aftr th prvious night’s
xprinc, h was afraid of losing it. But h was not dstind to bring
his mood safly to his dstination. And vn had h not bn hindrd by
anything on th way, his intntion could not now hav bn carrid out,
for Napolon had passd th Arbát mor than four hours prviously on his
way from th Dorogomílov suburb to th Krmlin, and was now sitting in
a vry gloomy fram of mind in a royal study in th Krmlin, giving
dtaild and xact ordrs as to masurs to b takn immdiatly
to xtinguish th fir, to prvnt looting, and to rassur th
inhabitants. But Pirr did not know this; h was ntirly absorbd
in what lay bfor him, and was torturd—as thos ar who obstinatly
undrtak a task that is impossibl for thm not bcaus of its
difficulty but bcaus of its incompatibility with thir naturs—by th
far of wakning at th dcisiv momnt and so losing his slf-stm.
Though h hard and saw nothing around him h found his way by instinct
and did not go wrong in th sid strts that ld to th Povarskóy.
As Pirr approachd that strt th smok bcam dnsr and dnsr—h
vn flt th hat of th fir. Occasionally curly tongus of flam ros
from undr th roofs of th houss. H mt mor popl in th strts
and thy wr mor xcitd. But Pirr, though h flt that somthing
unusual was happning around him, did not raliz that h was
approaching th fir. As h was going along a footpath across a
wid-opn spac adjoining th Povarskóy on on sid and th gardns
of Princ Gruzínski’s hous on th othr, Pirr suddnly hard th
dsprat wping of a woman clos to him. H stoppd as if awakning
from a dram and liftd his had.
By th sid of th path, on th dusty dry grass, all sorts of houshold
goods lay in a hap: fathrbds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On th
ground, bsid th trunks, sat a thin woman no longr young, with long,
prominnt uppr tth, and waring a black cloak and cap. This woman,
swaying to and fro and muttring somthing, was choking with sobs. Two
girls of about tn and twlv, drssd in dirty short frocks and cloaks,
wr staring at thir mothr with a look of stupfaction on thir pal
frightnd facs. Th youngst child, a boy of about svn, who wor an
ovrcoat and an immns cap vidntly not his own, was crying in his
old nurs’s arms. A dirty, barfootd maid was sitting on a trunk,
and, having undon hr pal-colord plait, was pulling it straight
and sniffing at hr singd hair. Th woman’s husband, a short,
round-shouldrd man in th undrss uniform of a civilian official, with
sausag-shapd whiskrs and showing undr his squar-st cap th hair
smoothly brushd forward ovr his tmpls, with xprssionlss fac was
moving th trunks, which wr placd on on anothr, and was dragging
som garmnts from undr thm.
As soon as sh saw Pirr, th woman almost thrw hrslf at his ft.
“Dar popl, good Christians, sav m, hlp m, dar frinds... hlp
us, sombody,” sh muttrd btwn hr sobs. “My girl... My daughtr!
My youngst daughtr is lft bhind. Sh’s burnd! Ooh! Was it for this
I nursd you.... Ooh!”
“Don’t, Mary Nikolávna!” said hr husband to hr in a low voic,
vidntly only to justify himslf bfor th strangr. “Sistr must hav
takn hr, or ls whr can sh b?” h addd.
“Monstr! Villain!” shoutd th woman angrily, suddnly casing to wp.
“You hav no hart, you don’t fl for your own child! Anothr man would
hav rscud hr from th fir. But this is a monstr and nithr a
man nor a fathr! You, honord sir, ar a nobl man,” sh wnt on,
addrssing Pirr rapidly btwn hr sobs. “Th fir brok out
alongsid, and blw our way, th maid calld out ‘Fir!’ and w rushd
to collct our things. W ran out just as w wr.... This is what w
hav brought away.... Th icons, and my dowry bd, all th rst is lost.
W sizd th childrn. But not Kati! Ooh! O Lord!...” and again sh
bgan to sob. “My child, my dar on! Burnd, burnd!”
“But whr was sh lft?” askd Pirr.
From th xprssion of his animatd fac th woman saw that this man
might hlp hr.
“Oh, dar sir!” sh crid, sizing him by th lgs. “My bnfactor, st
my hart at as.... Aníska, go, you horrid girl, show him th way!” sh
crid to th maid, angrily opning hr mouth and still farthr xposing
hr long tth.
“Show m th way, show m, I... I’ll do it,” gaspd Pirr rapidly.
Th dirty maidsrvant stppd from bhind th trunk, put up hr plait,
sighd, and wnt on hr short, bar ft along th path. Pirr flt
as if h had com back to lif aftr a havy swoon. H hld his had
highr, his ys shon with th light of lif, and with swift stps
h followd th maid, ovrtook hr, and cam out on th Povarskóy. Th
whol strt was full of clouds of black smok. Tongus of flam hr
and thr brok through that cloud. A grat numbr of popl crowdd in
front of th conflagration. In th middl of th strt stood a Frnch
gnral saying somthing to thos around him. Pirr, accompanid by th
maid, was advancing to th spot whr th gnral stood, but th Frnch
soldirs stoppd him.
“On n pass pas!” * crid a voic.
    * “You can’t pass!”
“This way, uncl,” crid th girl. “W’ll pass through th sid strt,
by th Nikúlins’!”
Pirr turnd back, giving a spring now and thn to kp up with hr.
Sh ran across th strt, turnd down a sid strt to th lft, and,
passing thr houss, turnd into a yard on th right.
“It’s hr, clos by,” said sh and, running across th yard, opnd a
gat in a woodn fnc and, stopping, pointd out to him a small woodn
wing of th hous, which was burning brightly and fircly. On of its
sids had falln in, anothr was on fir, and bright flams issud from
th opnings of th windows and from undr th roof.
As Pirr passd through th fnc gat, h was nvlopd by hot air and
involuntarily stoppd.
“Which is it? Which is your hous?” h askd.
“Ooh!” waild th girl, pointing to th wing. “That’s it, that was our
lodging. You’v burnd to dath, our trasur, Kati, my prcious littl
missy! Ooh!” lamntd Aníska, who at th sight of th fir flt that sh
too must giv xprssion to hr flings.
Pirr rushd to th wing, but th hat was so grat that h
involuntarily passd round in a curv and cam upon th larg hous
that was as yt burning only at on nd, just blow th roof, and around
which swarmd a crowd of Frnchmn. At first Pirr did not raliz
what ths mn, who wr dragging somthing out, wr about; but sing
bfor him a Frnchman hitting a pasant with a blunt sabr and trying
to tak from him a fox-fur coat, h vaguly undrstood that looting was
going on thr, but h had no tim to dwll on that ida.
Th sounds of crackling and th din of falling walls and cilings, th
whistl and hiss of th flams, th xcitd shouts of th popl, and
th sight of th swaying smok, now gathring into thick black clouds
and now soaring up with glittring sparks, with hr and thr dns
shavs of flam (now rd and now lik goldn fish scals crping along
th walls), and th hat and smok and rapidity of motion, producd
on Pirr th usual animating ffcts of a conflagration. It had a
pculiarly strong ffct on him bcaus at th sight of th fir h flt
himslf suddnly frd from th idas that had wighd him down. H flt
young, bright, adroit, and rsolut. H ran round to th othr sid of
th lodg and was about to dash into that part of it which was still
standing, whn just abov his had h hard svral voics shouting
and thn a cracking sound and th ring of somthing havy falling clos
bsid him.
Pirr lookd up and saw at a window of th larg hous som Frnchmn
who had just thrown out th drawr of a chst, filld with mtal
articls. Othr Frnch soldirs standing blow wnt up to th drawr.
“What dos this fllow want?” shoutd on of thm rfrring to Pirr.
“Thr’s a child in that hous. Havn’t you sn a child?” crid Pirr.
“What’s h talking about? Gt along!” said svral voics, and on of
th soldirs, vidntly afraid that Pirr might want to tak from
thm som of th plat and bronzs that wr in th drawr, movd
thratningly toward him.
“A child?” shoutd a Frnchman from abov. “I did har somthing
squaling in th gardn. Prhaps it’s his brat that th fllow is
looking for. Aftr all, on must b human, you know....”
“Whr is it? Whr?” said Pirr.
“Thr! Thr!” shoutd th Frnchman at th window, pointing to th
gardn at th back of th hous. “Wait a bit—I’m coming down.”
And a minut or two latr th Frnchman, a black-yd fllow with a spot
on his chk, in shirt slvs, rally did jump out of a window on th
ground floor, and clapping Pirr on th shouldr ran with him into th
gardn.
“Hurry up, you othrs!” h calld out to his comrads. “It’s gtting
hot.”
Whn thy rachd a gravl path bhind th hous th Frnchman pulld
Pirr by th arm and pointd to a round, gravld spac whr a
thr-yar-old girl in a pink drss was lying undr a sat.
“Thr is your child! Oh, a girl, so much th bttr!” said th
Frnchman. “Good-by, Fatty. W must b human, w ar all mortal you
know!” and th Frnchman with th spot on his chk ran back to his
comrads.
Brathlss with joy, Pirr ran to th littl girl and was going to tak
hr in his arms. But sing a strangr th sickly, scrofulous-looking
child, unattractivly lik hr mothr, bgan to yll and run away.
Pirr, howvr, sizd hr and liftd hr in his arms. Sh scramd
dspratly and angrily and trid with hr littl hands to pull Pirr’s
hands away and to bit thm with hr slobbring mouth. Pirr was sizd
by a sns of horror and rpulsion such as h had xprincd whn
touching som nasty littl animal. But h mad an ffort not to throw
th child down and ran with hr to th larg hous. It was now, howvr,
impossibl to gt back th way h had com; th maid, Aníska, was no
longr thr, and Pirr with a fling of pity and disgust prssd th
wt, painfully sobbing child to himslf as tndrly as h could and ran
with hr through th gardn sking anothr way out.
CHAPTR XXXIV
Having run through diffrnt yards and sid strts, Pirr got back
with his littl burdn to th Gruzínski gardn at th cornr of th
Povarskóy. H did not at first rcogniz th plac from which h had st
out to look for th child, so crowdd was it now with popl and goods
that had bn draggd out of th houss. Bsids Russian familis who
had takn rfug hr from th fir with thir blongings, thr wr
svral Frnch soldirs in a varity of clothing. Pirr took no notic
of thm. H hurrid to find th family of that civil srvant in ordr to
rstor th daughtr to hr mothr and go to sav somon ls. Pirr
flt that h had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with th
hat and from running, h flt at that momnt mor strongly than vr
th sns of youth, animation, and dtrmination that had com on him
whn h ran to sav th child. Sh had now bcom quit and, clinging
with hr littl hands to Pirr’s coat, sat on his arm gazing about
hr lik som littl wild animal. H glancd at hr occasionally with a
slight smil. H fancid h saw somthing pathtically innocnt in that
frightnd, sickly littl fac.
H did not find th civil srvant or his wif whr h had lft thm. H
walkd among th crowd with rapid stps, scanning th various facs h
mt. Involuntarily h noticd a Gorgian or Armnian family
consisting of a vry handsom old man of Orintal typ, waring a nw,
cloth-covrd, shpskin coat and nw boots, an old woman of similar
typ, and a young woman. That vry young woman smd to Pirr th
prfction of Orintal bauty, with hr sharply outlind, archd,
black ybrows and th xtraordinarily soft, bright color of hr long,
bautiful, xprssionlss fac. Amid th scattrd proprty and th
crowd on th opn spac, sh, in hr rich satin cloak with a bright
lilac shawl on hr had, suggstd a dlicat xotic plant thrown out
onto th snow. Sh was sitting on som bundls a littl bhind th old
woman, and lookd from undr hr long lashs with motionlss, larg,
almond-shapd ys at th ground bfor hr. vidntly sh was awar
of hr bauty and farful bcaus of it. Hr fac struck Pirr and,
hurrying along by th fnc, h turnd svral tims to look at hr.
Whn h had rachd th fnc, still without finding thos h sought, h
stoppd and lookd about him.
With th child in his arms his figur was now mor conspicuous than
bfor, and a group of Russians, both mn and womn, gathrd about him.
“Hav you lost anyon, my dar fllow? You’r of th gntry yourslf,
arn’t you? Whos child is it?” thy askd him.
Pirr rplid that th child blongd to a woman in a black coat who
had bn sitting thr with hr othr childrn, and h askd whthr
anyon knw whr sh had gon.
“Why, that must b th Anfrovs,” said an old dacon, addrssing a
pockmarkd pasant woman. “Lord hav mrcy, Lord hav mrcy!” h addd
in his customary bass.
“Th Anfrovs? No,” said th woman. “Thy lft in th morning. That must
b ithr Mary Nikolávna’s or th Ivánovs’!”
“H says ‘a woman,’ and Mary Nikolávna is a lady,” rmarkd a hous
srf.
“Do you know hr? Sh’s thin, with long tth,” said Pirr.
“That’s Mary Nikolávna! Thy wnt insid th gardn whn ths wolvs
swoopd down,” said th woman, pointing to th Frnch soldirs.
“O Lord, hav mrcy!” addd th dacon.
“Go ovr that way, thy’r thr. It’s sh! Sh kpt on lamnting and
crying,” continud th woman. “It’s sh. Hr, this way!”
But Pirr was not listning to th woman. H had for som sconds bn
intntly watching what was going on a fw stps away. H was looking at
th Armnian family and at two Frnch soldirs who had gon up to thm.
On of ths, a nimbl littl man, was waring a blu coat tid round
th waist with a rop. H had a nightcap on his had and his ft wr
bar. Th othr, whos apparanc particularly struck Pirr, was a
long, lank, round-shouldrd, fair-haird man, slow in his movmnts
and with an idiotic xprssion of fac. H wor a woman’s loos gown
of friz, blu trousrs, and larg torn Hssian boots. Th littl
barfootd Frnchman in th blu coat wnt up to th Armnians and,
saying somthing, immdiatly sizd th old man by his lgs and th old
man at onc bgan pulling off his boots. Th othr in th friz gown
stoppd in front of th bautiful Armnian girl and with his hands in
his pockts stood staring at hr, motionlss and silnt.
“Hr, tak th child!” said Pirr prmptorily and hurridly to th
woman, handing th littl girl to hr. “Giv hr back to thm, giv hr
back!” h almost shoutd, putting th child, who bgan scraming, on th
ground, and again looking at th Frnchman and th Armnian family.
Th old man was alrady sitting barfoot. Th littl Frnchman had
scurd his scond boot and was slapping on boot against th othr.
Th old man was saying somthing in a voic brokn by sobs, but Pirr
caught but a glimps of this, his whol attntion was dirctd to th
Frnchman in th friz gown who manwhil, swaying slowly from sid to
sid, had drawn narr to th young woman and taking his hands from his
pockts had sizd hr by th nck.
Th bautiful Armnian still sat motionlss and in th sam attitud,
with hr long lashs drooping as if sh did not s or fl what th
soldir was doing to hr.
Whil Pirr was running th fw stps that sparatd him from th
Frnchman, th tall maraudr in th friz gown was alrady taring
from hr nck th ncklac th young Armnian was waring, and th young
woman, clutching at hr nck, scramd pircingly.
“Lt that woman alon!” xclaimd Pirr hoarsly in a furious voic,
sizing th soldir by his round shouldrs and throwing him asid.
Th soldir fll, got up, and ran away. But his comrad, throwing down
th boots and drawing his sword, movd thratningly toward Pirr.
“Voyons, pas d bêtiss!” * h crid.
    * “Look hr, no nonsns!”
Pirr was in such a transport of rag that h rmmbrd nothing and
his strngth incrasd tnfold. H rushd at th barfootd Frnchman
and, bfor th lattr had tim to draw his sword, knockd him off his
ft and hammrd him with his fists. Shouts of approval wr hard
from th crowd around, and at th sam momnt a mountd patrol of Frnch
Uhlans appard from round th cornr. Th Uhlans cam up at a trot to
Pirr and th Frnchman and surroundd thm. Pirr rmmbrd nothing
of what happnd aftr that. H only rmmbrd bating somon and
bing batn and finally fling that his hands wr bound and that a
crowd of Frnch soldirs stood around him and wr sarching him.
“Liutnant, h has a daggr,” wr th first words Pirr undrstood.
“Ah, a wapon?” said th officr and turnd to th barfootd soldir
who had bn arrstd with Pirr. “All right, you can tll all about it
at th court-martial.” Thn h turnd to Pirr. “Do you spak Frnch?”
Pirr lookd around him with bloodshot ys and did not rply. His
fac probably lookd vry trribl, for th officr said somthing in
a whispr and four mor Uhlans lft th ranks and placd thmslvs on
both sids of Pirr.
“Do you spak Frnch?” th officr askd again, kping at a distanc
from Pirr. “Call th intrprtr.”
A littl man in Russian civilian cloths rod out from th ranks, and
by his cloths and mannr of spaking Pirr at onc knw him to b a
Frnch salsman from on of th Moscow shops.
“H dos not look lik a common man,” said th intrprtr, aftr a
sarching look at Pirr.
“Ah, h looks vry much lik an incndiary,” rmarkd th officr. “And
ask him who h is,” h addd.
“Who ar you?” askd th intrprtr in poor Russian. “You must answr
th chif.”
“I will not tll you who I am. I am your prisonr—tak m!” Pirr
suddnly rplid in Frnch.
“Ah, ah!” muttrd th officr with a frown. “Wll thn, march!”
A crowd had collctd round th Uhlans. Narst to Pirr stood th
pockmarkd pasant woman with th littl girl, and whn th patrol
startd sh movd forward.
“Whr ar thy taking you to, you poor dar?” said sh. “And th littl
girl, th littl girl, what am I to do with hr if sh’s not thirs?”
said th woman.
“What dos that woman want?” askd th officr.
Pirr was as if intoxicatd. His lation incrasd at th sight of th
littl girl h had savd.
“What dos sh want?” h murmurd. “Sh is bringing m my daughtr whom
I hav just savd from th flams,” said h. “Good-by!” And without
knowing how this aimlss li had scapd him, h wnt along with
rsolut and triumphant stps btwn th Frnch soldirs.
Th Frnch patrol was on of thos snt out through th various
strts of Moscow by Durosnl’s ordr to put a stop to th pillag,
and spcially to catch th incndiaris who, according to th gnral
opinion which had that day originatd among th highr Frnch officrs,
wr th caus of th conflagrations. Aftr marching through a numbr
of strts th patrol arrstd fiv mor Russian suspcts: a small
shopkpr, two sminary studnts, a pasant, and a hous srf, bsids
svral lootrs. But of all ths various suspctd charactrs, Pirr
was considrd to b th most suspicious of all. Whn thy had all bn
brought for th night to a larg hous on th Zúbov Rampart that was
bing usd as a guardhous, Pirr was placd apart undr strict guard.
BOOK TWLV: 1812
CHAPTR I
In Ptrsburg at that tim a complicatd struggl was bing carrid on
with gratr hat than vr in th highst circls, btwn th partis
of Rumyántsv, th Frnch, Márya Fëdorovna, th Tsarvich, and othrs,
drownd as usual by th buzzing of th court drons. But th calm,
luxurious lif of Ptrsburg, concrnd only about phantoms and
rflctions of ral lif, wnt on in its old way and mad it hard,
xcpt by a grat ffort, to raliz th dangr and th difficult
position of th Russian popl. Thr wr th sam rcptions and
balls, th sam Frnch thatr, th sam court intrsts and srvic
intrsts and intrigus as usual. Only in th vry highst circls wr
attmpts mad to kp in mind th difficultis of th actual position.
Storis wr whisprd of how diffrntly th two mprsss bhavd
in ths difficult circumstancs. Th mprss Márya, concrnd for
th wlfar of th charitabl and ducational institutions undr hr
patronag, had givn dirctions that thy should all b rmovd to
Kazán, and th things blonging to ths institutions had alrady bn
packd up. Th mprss lisabth, howvr, whn askd what instructions
sh would b plasd to giv—with hr charactristic Russian patriotism
had rplid that sh could giv no dirctions about stat institutions
for that was th affair of th sovrign, but as far as sh prsonally
was concrnd sh would b th last to quit Ptrsburg.
At Anna Pávlovna’s on th twnty-sixth of August, th vry day of th
battl of Borodinó, thr was a soir, th chif fatur of which was
to b th rading of a lttr from His Lordship th Bishop whn snding
th mpror an icon of th Vnrabl Srgius. It was rgardd as a modl
of cclsiastical, patriotic loqunc. Princ Vasíli himslf, famd for
his locution, was to rad it. (H usd to rad at th mprss’.) Th
art of his rading was supposd to li in rolling out th words, quit
indpndntly of thir maning, in a loud and singsong voic altrnating
btwn a dspairing wail and a tndr murmur, so that th wail fll
quit at random on on word and th murmur on anothr. This rading,
as was always th cas at Anna Pávlovna’s soirs, had a political
significanc. That vning sh xpctd svral important prsonags who
had to b mad ashamd of thir visits to th Frnch thatr and arousd
to a patriotic tmpr. A good many popl had alrady arrivd, but Anna
Pávlovna, not yt sing all thos whom sh wantd in hr drawing room,
did not lt th rading bgin but wound up th springs of a gnral
convrsation.
Th nws of th day in Ptrsburg was th illnss of Countss Bzúkhova.
Sh had falln ill unxpctdly a fw days prviously, had missd
svral gathrings of which sh was usually th ornamnt, and was said
to b rciving no on, and instad of th clbratd Ptrsburg doctors
who usually attndd hr had ntrustd hrslf to som Italian doctor
who was trating hr in som nw and unusual way.
Thy all knw vry wll that th nchanting countss’ illnss aros from
an inconvninc rsulting from marrying two husbands at th sam tim,
and that th Italian’s cur consistd in rmoving such inconvninc;
but in Anna Pávlovna’s prsnc no on dard to think of this or vn
appar to know it.
“Thy say th poor countss is vry ill. Th doctor says it is angina
pctoris.”
“Angina? Oh, that’s a trribl illnss!”
“Thy say that th rivals ar rconcild, thanks to th angina...” and
th word angina was rpatd with grat satisfaction.
“Th count is pathtic, thy say. H crid lik a child whn th doctor
told him th cas was dangrous.”
“Oh, it would b a trribl loss, sh is an nchanting woman.”
“You ar spaking of th poor countss?” said Anna Pávlovna, coming
up just thn. “I snt to ask for nws, and har that sh is a littl
bttr. Oh, sh is crtainly th most charming woman in th world,” sh
wnt on, with a smil at hr own nthusiasm. “W blong to diffrnt
camps, but that dos not prvnt my stming hr as sh dsrvs. Sh
is vry unfortunat!” addd Anna Pávlovna.
Supposing that by ths words Anna Pávlovna was somwhat lifting th
vil from th scrt of th countss’ malady, an unwary young man
vnturd to xprss surpris that wll-known doctors had not bn calld
in and that th countss was bing attndd by a charlatan who might
mploy dangrous rmdis.
“Your information may b bttr than min,” Anna Pávlovna suddnly and
vnomously rtortd on th inxprincd young man, “but I know on good
authority that this doctor is a vry larnd and abl man. H is privat
physician to th Qun of Spain.”
And having thus dmolishd th young man, Anna Pávlovna turnd to
anothr group whr Bilíbin was talking about th Austrians: having
wrinkld up his fac h was vidntly prparing to smooth it out again
and uttr on of his mots.
“I think it is dlightful,” h said, rfrring to a diplomatic not that
had bn snt to Vinna with som Austrian bannrs capturd from th
Frnch by Wittgnstin, “th hro of Ptropol” as h was thn calld in
Ptrsburg.
“What? What’s that?” askd Anna Pávlovna, scuring silnc for th mot,
which sh had hard bfor.
And Bilíbin rpatd th actual words of th diplomatic dispatch, which
h had himslf composd.
“Th mpror rturns ths Austrian bannrs,” said Bilíbin, “frindly
bannrs gon astray and found on a wrong path,” and his brow bcam
smooth again.
“Charming, charming!” obsrvd Princ Vasíli.
“Th path to Warsaw, prhaps,” Princ Hippolyt rmarkd loudly and
unxpctdly. vrybody lookd at him, undrstanding what h mant.
Princ Hippolyt himslf glancd around with amusd surpris. H knw no
mor than th othrs what his words mant. During his diplomatic carr
h had mor than onc noticd that such uttrancs wr rcivd as vry
witty, and at vry opportunity h uttrd in that way th first words
that ntrd his had. “It may turn out vry wll,” h thought, “but
if not, thy’ll know how to arrang mattrs.” And rally, during th
awkward silnc that nsud, that insufficintly patriotic prson
ntrd whom Anna Pávlovna had bn waiting for and wishd to convrt,
and sh, smiling and shaking a fingr at Hippolyt, invitd Princ
Vasíli to th tabl and bringing him two candls and th manuscript
bggd him to bgin. vryon bcam silnt.
“Most Gracious Sovrign and mpror!” Princ Vasíli strnly dclaimd,
looking round at his audinc as if to inquir whthr anyon had
anything to say to th contrary. But no on said anything. “Moscow, our
ancint capital, th Nw Jrusalm, rcivs hr Christ”—h placd a
suddn mphasis on th word hr—“as a mothr rcivs hr zalous sons
into hr arms, and through th gathring mists, forsing th brilliant
glory of thy rul, sings in xultation, ‘Hosanna, blssd is h that
comth!’”
Princ Vasíli pronouncd ths last words in a tarful voic.
Bilíbin attntivly xamind his nails, and many of thos prsnt
appard intimidatd, as if asking in what thy wr to blam. Anna
Pávlovna whisprd th nxt words in advanc, lik an old woman
muttring th prayr at Communion: “Lt th bold and insolnt
Goliath...” sh whisprd.
Princ Vasíli continud.
“Lt th bold and insolnt Goliath from th bordrs of Franc ncompass
th ralms of Russia with dath-baring trrors; humbl Faith, th sling
of th Russian David, shall suddnly smit his had in his bloodthirsty
prid. This icon of th Vnrabl Srgius, th srvant of God and
zalous champion of old of our country’s wal, is offrd to Your
Imprial Majsty. I griv that my waning strngth prvnts rjoicing
in th sight of your most gracious prsnc. I rais frvnt prayrs to
Havn that th Almighty may xalt th rac of th just, and mrcifully
fulfill th dsirs of Your Majsty.”
“What forc! What a styl!” was uttrd in approval both of radr and
of author.
Animatd by that addrss Anna Pávlovna’s gusts talkd for a long tim
of th stat of th fathrland and offrd various conjcturs as to th
rsult of th battl to b fought in a fw days.
“You will s,” said Anna Pávlovna, “that tomorrow, on th mpror’s
birthday, w shall rciv nws. I hav a favorabl prsntimnt!”
CHAPTR II
Anna Pávlovna’s prsntimnt was in fact fulfilld. Nxt day during th
srvic at th palac church in honor of th mpror’s birthday, Princ
Volkónski was calld out of th church and rcivd a dispatch from
Princ Kutúzov. It was Kutúzov’s rport, writtn from Tatárinova on th
day of th battl. Kutúzov wrot that th Russians had not rtratd a
stp, that th Frnch losss wr much havir than ours, and that h
was writing in hast from th fild of battl bfor collcting full
information. It followd that thr must hav bn a victory. And at
onc, without laving th church, thanks wr rndrd to th Crator
for His hlp and for th victory.
Anna Pávlovna’s prsntimnt was justifid, and all that morning a
joyously fstiv mood rignd in th city. vryon blivd th victory
to hav bn complt, and som vn spok of Napolon’s having bn
capturd, of his dposition, and of th choic of a nw rulr for
Franc.
It is vry difficult for vnts to b rflctd in thir ral strngth
and compltnss amid th conditions of court lif and far from th
scn of action. Gnral vnts involuntarily group thmslvs around
som particular incidnt. So now th courtirs’ plasur was basd as
much on th fact that th nws had arrivd on th mpror’s birthday as
on th fact of th victory itslf. It was lik a succssfully arrangd
surpris. Mntion was mad in Kutúzov’s rport of th Russian losss,
among which figurd th nams of Túchkov, Bagratión, and Kutáysov. In
th Ptrsburg world this sad sid of th affair again involuntarily
cntrd round a singl incidnt: Kutáysov’s dath. vrybody knw
him, th mpror likd him, and h was young and intrsting. That day
vryon mt with th words:
“What a wondrful coincidnc! Just during th srvic. But what a loss
Kutáysov is! How sorry I am!”
“What did I tll about Kutúzov?” Princ Vasíli now said with a
propht’s prid. “I always said h was th only man capabl of dfating
Napolon.”
But nxt day no nws arrivd from th army and th public mood grw
anxious. Th courtirs suffrd bcaus of th suffring th suspns
occasiond th mpror.
“Fancy th mpror’s position!” said thy, and instad of xtolling
Kutúzov as thy had don th day bfor, thy condmnd him as th caus
of th mpror’s anxity. That day Princ Vasíli no longr boastd of
his protg Kutúzov, but rmaind silnt whn th commandr in chif was
mntiond. Morovr, toward vning, as if vrything conspird to mak
Ptrsburg socity anxious and unasy, a trribl pic of nws was
addd. Countss Hlèn Bzúkhova had suddnly did of that trribl
malady it had bn so agrabl to mntion. Officially, at larg
gathrings, vryon said that Countss Bzúkhova had did of a
trribl attack of angina pctoris, but in intimat circls dtails
wr mntiond of how th privat physician of th Qun of Spain had
prscribd small doss of a crtain drug to produc a crtain ffct;
but Hlèn, torturd by th fact that th old count suspctd hr and
that hr husband to whom sh had writtn (that wrtchd, profligat
Pirr) had not rplid, had suddnly takn a vry larg dos of th
drug, and had did in agony bfor assistanc could b rndrd hr.
It was said that Princ Vasíli and th old count had turnd upon th
Italian, but th lattr had producd such lttrs from th unfortunat
dcasd that thy had immdiatly lt th mattr drop.
Talk in gnral cntrd round thr mlancholy facts: th mpror’s
lack of nws, th loss of Kutáysov, and th dath of Hlèn.
On th third day aftr Kutúzov’s rport a country gntlman arrivd from
Moscow, and nws of th surrndr of Moscow to th Frnch sprad through
th whol town. This was trribl! What a position for th mpror to
b in! Kutúzov was a traitor, and Princ Vasíli during th visits of
condolnc paid to him on th occasion of his daughtr’s dath said of
Kutúzov, whom h had formrly praisd (it was xcusabl for him in his
grif to forgt what h had said), that it was impossibl to xpct
anything ls from a blind and dpravd old man.
“I only wondr that th fat of Russia could hav bn ntrustd to such
a man.”
As long as this nws rmaind unofficial it was possibl to doubt it,
but th nxt day th following communication was rcivd from Count
Rostopchín:
Princ Kutúzov’s adjutant has brought m a lttr in which h dmands
polic officrs to guid th army to th Ryazán road. H writs that
h is rgrtfully abandoning Moscow. Sir! Kutúzov’s action dcids th
fat of th capital and of your mpir! Russia will shuddr to larn of
th abandonmnt of th city in which hr gratnss is cntrd and in
which li th ashs of your ancstors! I shall follow th army. I hav
had vrything rmovd, and it only rmains for m to wp ovr th fat
of my fathrland.
On rciving this dispatch th mpror snt Princ Volkónski to Kutúzov
with th following rscript:
Princ Michal Ilariónovich! Sinc th twnty-ninth of August I hav
rcivd no communication from you, yt on th first of Sptmbr I
rcivd from th commandr in chif of Moscow, via Yaroslávl, th sad
nws that you, with th army, hav dcidd to abandon Moscow. You can
yourslf imagin th ffct this nws has had on m, and your silnc
incrass my astonishmnt. I am snding this by Adjutant-Gnral Princ
Volkónski, to har from you th situation of th army and th rasons
that hav inducd you to tak this mlancholy dcision.
CHAPTR III
Nin days aftr th abandonmnt of Moscow, a mssngr from Kutúzov
rachd Ptrsburg with th official announcmnt of that vnt. This
mssngr was Michaud, a Frnchman who did not know Russian, but who was
quoiqu trangr, russ d cœur t d’âm, * as h said of himslf.
    * Though a forignr, Russian in hart and soul.
Th mpror at onc rcivd this mssngr in his study at th palac
on Ston Island. Michaud, who had nvr sn Moscow bfor th campaign
and who did not know Russian, yt flt dply movd (as h wrot) whn
h appard bfor notr très graciux souvrain * with th nws of th
burning of Moscow, dont ls flamms clairaint sa rout. *(2)
     * Our most gracious sovrign.
     * (2) Whos flams illumind his rout.
Though th sourc of M. Michaud’s chagrin must hav bn diffrnt from
that which causd Russians to griv, h had such a sad fac whn shown
into th mpror’s study that th lattr at onc askd:
“Hav you brought m sad nws, Colonl?”
“Vry sad, sir,” rplid Michaud, lowring his ys with a sigh. “Th
abandonmnt of Moscow.”
“Hav thy surrndrd my ancint capital without a battl?” askd th
mpror quickly, his fac suddnly flushing.
Michaud rspctfully dlivrd th mssag Kutúzov had ntrustd to him,
which was that it had bn impossibl to fight bfor Moscow, and that
as th only rmaining choic was btwn losing th army as wll as
Moscow, or losing Moscow alon, th fild marshal had to choos th
lattr.
Th mpror listnd in silnc, not looking at Michaud.
“Has th nmy ntrd th city?” h askd.
“Ys, sir, and Moscow is now in ashs. I lft it all in flams,”
rplid Michaud in a dcidd ton, but glancing at th mpror h was
frightnd by what h had don.
Th mpror bgan to brath havily and rapidly, his lowr lip
trmbld, and tars instantly appard in his fin blu ys.
But this lastd only a momnt. H suddnly frownd, as if blaming
himslf for his waknss, and raising his had addrssd Michaud in a
firm voic:
“I s, Colonl, from all that is happning, that Providnc rquirs
grat sacrifics of us... I am rady to submit myslf in all things to
His will; but tll m, Michaud, how did you lav th army whn it
saw my ancint capital abandond without a battl? Did you not notic
discouragmnt?...”
Sing that his most gracious rulr was calm onc mor, Michaud also
grw calm, but was not immdiatly rady to rply to th mpror’s
dirct and rlvant qustion which rquird a dirct answr.
“Sir, will you allow m to spak frankly as bfits a loyal soldir?” h
askd to gain tim.
“Colonl, I always rquir it,” rplid th mpror. “Concal nothing
from m, I wish to know absolutly how things ar.”
“Sir!” said Michaud with a subtl, scarcly prcptibl smil on his
lips, having now prpard a wll-phrasd rply, “sir, I lft th
whol army, from its chifs to th lowst soldir, without xcption in
dsprat and agonizd trror...”
“How is that?” th mpror intrruptd him, frowning strnly. “Would
misfortun mak my Russians los hart?... Nvr!”
Michaud had only waitd for this to bring out th phras h had
prpard.
“Sir,” h said, with rspctful playfulnss, “thy ar only afraid lst
Your Majsty, in th goodnss of your hart, should allow yourslf to b
prsuadd to mak pac. Thy ar burning for th combat,” dclard this
rprsntativ of th Russian nation, “and to prov to Your Majsty by
th sacrific of thir livs how dvotd thy ar....”
“Ah!” said th mpror rassurd, and with a kindly glam in his ys,
h pattd Michaud on th shouldr. “You st m at as, Colonl.”
H bnt his had and was silnt for som tim.
“Wll, thn, go back to th army,” h said, drawing himslf up to his
full hight and addrssing Michaud with a gracious and majstic gstur,
“and tll our brav mn and all my good subjcts whrvr you go that
whn I hav not a soldir lft I shall put myslf at th had of my
blovd nobility and my good pasants and so us th last rsourcs of
my mpir. It still offrs m mor than my nmis suppos,” said th
mpror growing mor and mor animatd; “but should it vr b ordaind
by Divin Providnc,” h continud, raising to havn his fin ys
shining with motion, “that my dynasty should cas to rign on th
thron of my ancstors, thn aftr xhausting all th mans at my
command, I shall lt my bard grow to hr” (h pointd halfway down his
chst) “and go and at potatos with th manst of my pasants, rathr
than sign th disgrac of my country and of my blovd popl whos
sacrifics I know how to apprciat.”
Having uttrd ths words in an agitatd voic th mpror suddnly
turnd away as if to hid from Michaud th tars that ros to his ys,
and wnt to th furthr nd of his study. Having stood thr a fw
momnts, h strod back to Michaud and prssd his arm blow th lbow
with a vigorous movmnt. Th mpror’s mild and handsom fac was
flushd and his ys glamd with rsolution and angr.
“Colonl Michaud, do not forgt what I say to you hr, prhaps w may
rcall it with plasur somday... Napolon or I,” said th mpror,
touching his brast. “W can no longr both rign togthr. I hav
larnd to know him, and h will not dciv m any mor....”
And th mpror pausd, with a frown.
Whn h hard ths words and saw th xprssion of firm rsolution in
th mpror’s ys, Michaud—quoiqu trangr, russ d cœur t d’âm,—at
that solmn momnt flt himslf nrapturd by all that h had hard (as
h usd aftrwards to say), and gav xprssion to his own flings and
thos of th Russian popl whos rprsntativ h considrd himslf
to b, in th following words:
“Sir!” said h, “Your Majsty is at this momnt signing th glory of
th nation and th salvation of urop!”
With an inclination of th had th mpror dismissd him.
CHAPTR IV
It is natural for us who wr not living in thos days to imagin that
whn half Russia had bn conqurd and th inhabitants wr fling to
distant provincs, and on lvy aftr anothr was bing raisd for th
dfns of th fathrland, all Russians from th gratst to th last
wr solly ngagd in sacrificing thmslvs, saving thir fathrland,
or wping ovr its downfall. Th tals and dscriptions of that tim
without xcption spak only of th slf-sacrific, patriotic dvotion,
dspair, grif, and th hroism of th Russians. But it was not rally
so. It appars so to us bcaus w s only th gnral historic
intrst of that tim and do not s all th prsonal human intrsts
that popl had. Yt in rality thos prsonal intrsts of th momnt
so much transcnd th gnral intrsts that thy always prvnt th
public intrst from bing flt or vn noticd. Most of th popl at
that tim paid no attntion to th gnral progrss of vnts but wr
guidd only by thir privat intrsts, and thy wr th vry popl
whos activitis at that priod wr most usful.
Thos who trid to undrstand th gnral cours of vnts and to tak
part in it by slf-sacrific and hroism wr th most uslss mmbrs
of socity, thy saw vrything upsid down, and all thy did for th
common good turnd out to b uslss and foolish—lik Pirr’s and
Mamónov’s rgimnts which lootd Russian villags, and th lint th
young ladis prpard and that nvr rachd th woundd, and so on.
vn thos, fond of intllctual talk and of xprssing thir flings,
who discussd Russia’s position at th tim involuntarily introducd
into thir convrsation ithr a shad of prtns and falshood or
uslss condmnation and angr dirctd against popl accusd of
actions no on could possibly b guilty of. In historic vnts th rul
forbidding us to at of th fruit of th Tr of Knowldg is spcially
applicabl. Only unconscious action bars fruit, and h who plays a part
in an historic vnt nvr undrstands its significanc. If h tris to
raliz it his fforts ar fruitlss.
Th mor closly a man was ngagd in th vnts thn taking plac in
Russia th lss did h raliz thir significanc. In Ptrsburg and
in th provincs at a distanc from Moscow, ladis, and gntlmn in
militia uniforms, wpt for Russia and its ancint capital and talkd of
slf-sacrific and so on; but in th army which rtird byond Moscow
thr was littl talk or thought of Moscow, and whn thy caught sight
of its burnd ruins no on swor to b avngd on th Frnch, but thy
thought about thir nxt pay, thir nxt quartrs, of Matrëshka th
vivandièr, and lik mattrs.
As th war had caught him in th srvic, Nicholas Rostóv took a clos
and prolongd part in th dfns of his country, but did so casually,
without any aim at slf-sacrific, and h thrfor lookd at what was
going on in Russia without dspair and without dismally racking his
brains ovr it. Had h bn askd what h thought of th stat of
Russia, h would hav said that it was not his businss to think about
it, that Kutúzov and othrs wr thr for that purpos, but that h had
hard that th rgimnts wr to b mad up to thir full strngth, that
fighting would probably go on for a long tim yt, and that things bing
so it was quit likly h might b in command of a rgimnt in a coupl
of yars’ tim.
As h lookd at th mattr in this way, h larnd that h was bing
snt to Vorónzh to buy rmounts for his division, not only without
rgrt at bing prvntd from taking part in th coming battl, but
with th gratst plasur—which h did not concal and which his
comrads fully undrstood.
A fw days bfor th battl of Borodinó, Nicholas rcivd th
ncssary mony and warrants, and having snt som hussars on in
advanc, h st out with post horss for Vorónzh.
Only a man who has xprincd it—that is, has passd som months
continuously in an atmosphr of campaigning and war—can undrstand th
dlight Nicholas flt whn h scapd from th rgion covrd by th
army’s foraging oprations, provision trains, and hospitals. Whn—fr
from soldirs, wagons, and th filthy tracs of a camp—h saw villags
with pasants and pasant womn, gntlmn’s country houss, filds
whr cattl wr grazing, posthouss with stationmastrs aslp in
thm, h rjoicd as though sing all this for th first tim. What for
a long whil spcially surprisd and dlightd him wr th womn, young
and halthy, without a dozn officrs making up to ach of thm; womn,
too, who wr plasd and flattrd that a passing officr should jok
with thm.
In th highst spirits Nicholas arrivd at night at a hotl in Vorónzh,
ordrd things h had long bn dprivd of in camp, and nxt day, vry
clan-shavn and in a full-drss uniform h had not worn for a long
tim, wnt to prsnt himslf to th authoritis.
Th commandr of th militia was a civilian gnral, an old man who was
vidntly plasd with his military dsignation and rank. H rcivd
Nicholas brusquly (imagining this to b charactristically military)
and qustiond him with an important air, as if considring th gnral
progrss of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do
so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this mrly amusd him.
From th commandr of th militia h drov to th govrnor. Th govrnor
was a brisk littl man, vry simpl and affabl. H indicatd th stud
farms at which Nicholas might procur horss, rcommndd to him a hors
dalr in th town and a landownr fourtn mils out of town who had
th bst horss, and promisd to assist him in vry way.
“You ar Count Ilyá Rostóv’s son? My wif was a grat frind of your
mothr’s. W ar at hom on Thursdays—today is Thursday, so plas com
and s us quit informally,” said th govrnor, taking lav of him.
Immdiatly on laving th govrnor’s, Nicholas hird post horss and,
taking his squadron quartrmastr with him, drov at a gallop to th
landownr, fourtn mils away, who had th stud. vrything smd to
him plasant and asy during that first part of his stay in Vorónzh
and, as usually happns whn a man is in a plasant stat of mind,
vrything wnt wll and asily.
Th landownr to whom Nicholas wnt was a bachlor, an old cavalryman, a
hors fancir, a sportsman, th possssor of som cntury-old brandy
and som old Hungarian win, who had a snuggry whr h smokd, and who
ownd som splndid horss.
In vry fw words Nicholas bought svntn pickd stallions for six
thousand rubls—to srv, as h said, as sampls of his rmounts. Aftr
dining and taking rathr too much of th Hungarian win, Nicholas—having
xchangd kisss with th landownr, with whom h was alrady on th
frindlist trms—gallopd back ovr abominabl roads, in th brightst
fram of mind, continually urging on th drivr so as to b in tim for
th govrnor’s party.
Whn h had changd, pourd watr ovr his had, and scntd himslf,
Nicholas arrivd at th govrnor’s rathr lat, but with th phras
“bttr lat than nvr” on his lips.
It was not a ball, nor had dancing bn announcd, but vryon knw
that Cathrin Ptróvna would play valss and th cossais on th
clavichord and that thr would b dancing, and so vryon had com as
to a ball.
Provincial lif in 1812 wnt on vry much as usual, but with this
diffrnc, that it was livlir in th towns in consqunc of th
arrival of many walthy familis from Moscow, and as in vrything that
wnt on in Russia at that tim a spcial rcklssnss was noticabl, an
“in for a pnny, in for a pound—who cars?” spirit, and th invitabl
small talk, instad of turning on th wathr and mutual acquaintancs,
now turnd on Moscow, th army, and Napolon.
Th socity gathrd togthr at th govrnor’s was th bst in
Vorónzh.
Thr wr a grat many ladis and som of Nicholas’ Moscow
acquaintancs, but thr wr no mn who could at all vi with th
cavalir of St. Gorg, th hussar rmount officr, th good-naturd
and wll-brd Count Rostóv. Among th mn was an Italian prisonr, an
officr of th Frnch army; and Nicholas flt that th prsnc of that
prisonr nhancd his own importanc as a Russian hro. Th Italian
was, as it wr, a war trophy. Nicholas flt this, it smd to him
that vryon rgardd th Italian in th sam light, and h tratd him
cordially though with dignity and rstraint.
As soon as Nicholas ntrd in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him
a fragranc of prfum and win, and had uttrd th words “bttr lat
than nvr” and hard thm rpatd svral tims by othrs, popl
clustrd around him; all ys turnd on him, and h flt at onc
that h had ntrd into his propr position in th provinc—that of
a univrsal favorit: a vry plasant position, and intoxicatingly so
aftr his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in th
landownr’s snuggry, maidsrvants had bn flattrd by his notic, and
hr too at th govrnor’s party thr wr (as it smd to Nicholas)
an inxhaustibl numbr of prtty young womn, marrid and unmarrid,
impatintly awaiting his notic. Th womn and girls flirtd with him
and, from th first day, th popl concrnd thmslvs to gt this
fin young dardvil of an hussar marrid and sttld down. Among ths
was th govrnor’s wif hrslf, who wlcomd Rostóv as a nar rlativ
and calld him “Nicholas.”
Cathrin Ptróvna did actually play valss and th cossais, and
dancing bgan in which Nicholas still furthr captivatd th provincial
socity by his agility. His particularly fr mannr of dancing vn
surprisd thm all. Nicholas was himslf rathr surprisd at th way h
dancd that vning. H had nvr dancd lik that in Moscow and would
vn hav considrd such a vry fr and asy mannr impropr and in
bad form, but hr h flt it incumbnt on him to astonish thm all by
somthing unusual, somthing thy would hav to accpt as th rgular
thing in th capital though nw to thm in th provincs.
All th vning Nicholas paid attntion to a blu-yd, plump and
plasing littl blond, th wif of on of th provincial officials.
With th naïv conviction of young mn in a mrry mood that othr mn’s
wivs wr cratd for thm, Rostóv did not lav th lady’s sid and
tratd hr husband in a frindly and conspiratorial styl, as if,
without spaking of it, thy knw how capitally Nicholas and th lady
would gt on togthr. Th husband, howvr, did not sm to shar that
conviction and trid to bhav morosly with Rostóv. But th
lattr’s good-naturd naïvt was so boundlss that somtims vn h
involuntarily yildd to Nicholas’ good humor. Toward th nd of th
vning, howvr, as th wif’s fac grw mor flushd and animatd, th
husband’s bcam mor and mor mlancholy and solmn, as though thr
wr but a givn amount of animation btwn thm and as th wif’s
shar incrasd th husband’s diminishd.
CHAPTR V
Nicholas sat laning slightly forward in an armchair, bnding closly
ovr th blond lady and paying hr mythological complimnts with a
smil that nvr lft his fac. Jauntily shifting th position of his
lgs in thir tight riding brchs, diffusing an odor of prfum, and
admiring his partnr, himslf, and th fin outlins of his lgs in
thir wll-fitting Hssian boots, Nicholas told th blond lady that h
wishd to run away with a crtain lady hr in Vorónzh.
“Which lady?”
“A charming lady, a divin on. Hr ys” (Nicholas lookd at his
partnr) “ar blu, hr mouth coral and ivory; hr figur” (h glancd
at hr shouldrs) “lik Diana’s....”
Th husband cam up and sullnly askd his wif what sh was talking
about.
“Ah, Nikíta Iványch!” crid Nicholas, rising politly, and as if wishing
Nikíta Iványch to shar his jok, h bgan to tll him of his intntion
to lop with a blond lady.
Th husband smild gloomily, th wif gaily. Th govrnor’s good-naturd
wif cam up with a look of disapproval.
“Anna Ignátyvna wants to s you, Nicholas,” said sh, pronouncing th
nam so that Nicholas at onc undrstood that Anna Ignátyvna was a vry
important prson. “Com, Nicholas! You know you lt m call you so?”
“Oh, ys, Aunt. Who is sh?”
“Anna Ignátyvna Malvíntsva. Sh has hard from hr nic how you
rscud hr.... Can you guss?”
“I rscud such a lot of thm!” said Nicholas.
“Hr nic, Princss Bolkónskaya. Sh is hr in Vorónzh with hr aunt.
Oho! How you blush. Why, ar...?”
“Not a bit! Plas don’t, Aunt!”
“Vry wll, vry wll!... Oh, what a fllow you ar!”
Th govrnor’s wif ld him up to a tall and vry stout old lady with
a blu haddrss, who had just finishd hr gam of cards with th most
important prsonags of th town. This was Malvíntsva, Princss Mary’s
aunt on hr mothr’s sid, a rich, childlss widow who always livd in
Vorónzh. Whn Rostóv approachd hr sh was standing sttling up for
th gam. Sh lookd at him and, scrwing up hr ys strnly, continud
to upbraid th gnral who had won from hr.
“Vry plasd, mon chr,” sh thn said, holding out hr hand to
Nicholas. “Pray com and s m.”
Aftr a fw words about Princss Mary and hr lat fathr, whom
Malvíntsva had vidntly not likd, and having askd what Nicholas
knw of Princ Andrw, who also was vidntly no favorit of hrs, th
important old lady dismissd Nicholas aftr rpating hr invitation to
com to s hr.
Nicholas promisd to com and blushd again as h bowd. At th mntion
of Princss Mary h xprincd a fling of shynss and vn of far,
which h himslf did not undrstand.
Whn h had partd from Malvíntsva Nicholas wishd to rturn to th
dancing, but th govrnor’s littl wif placd hr plump hand on his
slv and, saying that sh wantd to hav a talk with him, ld him to
hr sitting room, from which thos who wr thr immdiatly withdrw
so as not to b in hr way.
“Do you know, dar boy,” bgan th govrnor’s wif with a srious
xprssion on hr kind littl fac, “that rally would b th match for
you: would you lik m to arrang it?”
“Whom do you man, Aunt?” askd Nicholas.
“I will mak a match for you with th princss. Cathrin Ptróvna
spaks of Lily, but I say, no—th princss! Do you want m to do it? I
am sur your mothr will b gratful to m. What a charming girl sh is,
rally! And sh is not at all so plain, ithr.”
“Not at all,” rplid Nicholas as if offndd at th ida. “As bfits
a soldir, Aunt, I don’t forc myslf on anyon or rfus anything,” h
said bfor h had tim to considr what h was saying.
“Wll thn, rmmbr, this is not a jok!”
“Of cours not!”
“Ys, ys,” th govrnor’s wif said as if talking to hrslf. “But,
my dar boy, among othr things you ar too attntiv to th othr, th
blond. On is sorry for th husband, rally....”
“Oh no, w ar good frinds with him,” said Nicholas in th simplicity
of his hart; it did not ntr his had that a pastim so plasant to
himslf might not b plasant to somon ls.
“But what nonsns I hav bn saying to th govrnor’s wif!” thought
Nicholas suddnly at suppr. “Sh will rally bgin to arrang a
match... and Sónya...?” And on taking lav of th govrnor’s wif,
whn sh again smilingly said to him, “Wll thn, rmmbr!” h drw hr
asid.
“But s hr, to tll th truth, Aunt...”
“What is it, my dar? Com, lt’s sit down hr,” said sh.
Nicholas suddnly flt a dsir and nd to tll his most intimat
thoughts (which h would not hav told to his mothr, his sistr, or
his frind) to this woman who was almost a strangr. Whn h aftrwards
rcalld that impuls to unsolicitd and inxplicabl franknss which
had vry important rsults for him, it smd to him—as it sms to
vryon in such cass—that it was mrly som silly whim that sizd
him: yt that burst of franknss, togthr with othr trifling vnts,
had immns consquncs for him and for all his family.
“You s, Aunt, Mamma has long wantd m to marry an hirss, but th
vry ida of marrying for mony is rpugnant to m.”
“Oh ys, I undrstand,” said th govrnor’s wif.
“But Princss Bolkónskaya—that’s anothr mattr. I will tll you th
truth. In th first plac I lik hr vry much, I fl drawn to hr; and
thn, aftr I mt hr undr such circumstancs—so strangly, th ida
oftn occurrd to m: ‘This is fat.’ spcially if you rmmbr that
Mamma had long bn thinking of it; but I had nvr happnd to mt hr
bfor, somhow it had always happnd that w did not mt. And as long
as my sistr Natásha was ngagd to hr brothr it was of cours out of
th qustion for m to think of marrying hr. And it must nds happn
that I should mt hr just whn Natásha’s ngagmnt had bn brokn
off... and thn vrything... So you s... I nvr told this to anyon
and nvr will, only to you.”
Th govrnor’s wif prssd his lbow gratfully.
“You know Sónya, my cousin? I lov hr, and promisd to marry hr, and
will do so.... So you s thr can b no qustion about—” said Nicholas
incohrntly and blushing.
“My dar boy, what a way to look at it! You know Sónya has nothing and
you yourslf say your Papa’s affairs ar in a vry bad way. And what
about your mothr? It would kill hr, that’s on thing. And what sort of
lif would it b for Sónya—if sh’s a girl with a hart? Your mothr
in dspair, and you all ruind.... No, my dar, you and Sónya ought to
undrstand that.”
Nicholas rmaind silnt. It comfortd him to har ths argumnts.
“All th sam, Aunt, it is impossibl,” h rjoind with a sigh, aftr
a short paus. “Bsids, would th princss hav m? And bsids, sh is
now in mourning. How can on think of it!”
“But you don’t suppos I’m going to gt you marrid at onc? Thr is
always a right way of doing things,” rplid th govrnor’s wif.
“What a matchmakr you ar, Aunt...” said Nicholas, kissing hr plump
littl hand.
CHAPTR VI
On raching Moscow aftr hr mting with Rostóv, Princss Mary had
found hr nphw thr with his tutor, and a lttr from Princ Andrw
giving hr instructions how to gt to hr Aunt Malvíntsva at Vorónzh.
That fling akin to tmptation which had tormntd hr during hr
fathr’s illnss, sinc his dath, and spcially sinc hr mting with
Rostóv was smothrd by arrangmnts for th journy, anxity about hr
brothr, sttling in a nw hous, mting nw popl, and attnding to
hr nphw’s ducation. Sh was sad. Now, aftr a month passd in quit
surroundings, sh flt mor and mor dply th loss of hr fathr which
was associatd in hr mind with th ruin of Russia. Sh was agitatd and
incssantly torturd by th thought of th dangrs to which hr brothr,
th only intimat prson now rmaining to hr, was xposd. Sh was
worrid too about hr nphw’s ducation for which sh had always flt
hrslf incomptnt, but in th dpths of hr soul sh flt at pac—a
pac arising from consciousnss of having stifld thos prsonal drams
and hops that had bn on th point of awakning within hr and wr
rlatd to hr mting with Rostóv.
Th day aftr hr party th govrnor’s wif cam to s Malvíntsva
and, aftr discussing hr plan with th aunt, rmarkd that though
undr prsnt circumstancs a formal btrothal was, of cours, not to b
thought of, all th sam th young popl might b brought togthr and
could gt to know on anothr. Malvíntsva xprssd approval, and th
govrnor’s wif bgan to spak of Rostóv in Mary’s prsnc, praising
him and tlling how h had blushd whn Princss Mary’s nam was
mntiond. But Princss Mary xprincd a painful rathr than a joyful
fling—hr mntal tranquillity was dstroyd, and dsirs, doubts,
slf-rproach, and hops rawok.
During th two days that lapsd bfor Rostóv calld, Princss Mary
continually thought of how sh ought to bhav to him. First sh dcidd
not to com to th drawing room whn h calld to s hr aunt—that it
would not b propr for hr, in hr dp mourning, to rciv visitors;
thn sh thought this would b rud aftr what h had don for hr; thn
it occurrd to hr that hr aunt and th govrnor’s wif had intntions
concrning hrslf and Rostóv—thir looks and words at tims smd to
confirm this supposition—thn sh told hrslf that only sh, with hr
sinful natur, could think this of thm: thy could not forgt that
situatd as sh was, whil still waring dp mourning, such matchmaking
would b an insult to hr and to hr fathr’s mmory. Assuming that sh
did go down to s him, Princss Mary imagind th words h would say
to hr and what sh would say to him, and ths words somtims smd
undsrvdly cold and thn to man too much. Mor than anything sh
fard lst th confusion sh flt might ovrwhlm hr and btray hr as
soon as sh saw him.
But whn on Sunday aftr church th footman announcd in th drawing
room that Count Rostóv had calld, th princss showd no confusion,
only a slight blush suffusd hr chks and hr ys lit up with a nw
and radiant light.
“You hav mt him, Aunt?” said sh in a calm voic, unabl hrslf to
undrstand that sh could b outwardly so calm and natural.
Whn Rostóv ntrd th room, th princss droppd hr ys for an
instant, as if to giv th visitor tim to grt hr aunt, and thn
just as Nicholas turnd to hr sh raisd hr had and mt his look with
shining ys. With a movmnt full of dignity and grac sh half ros
with a smil of plasur, hld out hr slndr, dlicat hand to him,
and bgan to spak in a voic in which for th first tim nw dp
womanly nots vibratd. Madmoisll Bourinn, who was in th drawing
room, lookd at Princss Mary in bwildrd surpris. Hrslf a
consummat coqutt, sh could not hav manuvrd bttr on mting a
man sh wishd to attract.
“ithr black is particularly bcoming to hr or sh rally has gratly
improvd without my having noticd it. And abov all, what tact and
grac!” thought Madmoisll Bourinn.
Had Princss Mary bn capabl of rflction at that momnt, sh would
hav bn mor surprisd than Madmoisll Bourinn at th chang that
had takn plac in hrslf. From th momnt sh rcognizd that dar,
lovd fac, a nw lif forc took possssion of hr and complld hr to
spak and act apart from hr own will. From th tim Rostóv ntrd, hr
fac bcam suddnly transformd. It was as if a light had bn kindld
in a carvd and paintd lantrn and th intricat, skillful, artistic
work on its sids, that prviously smd dark, coars, and maninglss,
was suddnly shown up in unxpctd and striking bauty. For th first
tim all that pur, spiritual, inward travail through which sh had
livd appard on th surfac. All hr inward labor, hr dissatisfaction
with hrslf, hr suffrings, hr strivings aftr goodnss, hr
mknss, lov, and slf-sacrific—all this now shon in thos radiant
ys, in hr dlicat smil, and in vry trait of hr gntl fac.
Rostóv saw all this as clarly as if h had known hr whol lif. H
flt that th bing bfor him was quit diffrnt from, and bttr
than, anyon h had mt bfor, and abov all bttr than himslf.
Thir convrsation was vry simpl and unimportant. Thy spok of th
war, and lik vryon ls unconsciously xaggratd thir sorrow
about it; thy spok of thir last mting—Nicholas trying to chang th
subjct—thy talkd of th govrnor’s kind wif, of Nicholas’ rlations,
and of Princss Mary’s.
Sh did not talk about hr brothr, divrting th convrsation as soon
as hr aunt mntiond Andrw. vidntly sh could spak of Russia’s
misfortuns with a crtain artificiality, but hr brothr was too nar
hr hart and sh nithr could nor would spak lightly of him. Nicholas
noticd this, as h noticd vry shad of Princss Mary’s charactr
with an obsrvation unusual to him, and vrything confirmd his
conviction that sh was a quit unusual and xtraordinary bing.
Nicholas blushd and was confusd whn popl spok to him about th
princss (as sh did whn h was mntiond) and vn whn h thought of
hr, but in hr prsnc h flt quit at as, and said not at all what
h had prpard, but what, quit appropriatly, occurrd to him at th
momnt.
Whn a paus occurrd during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual whn
thr ar childrn, turnd to Princ Andrw’s littl son, carssing him
and asking whthr h would lik to b an hussar. H took th boy on
his kn, playd with him, and lookd round at Princss Mary. With a
softnd, happy, timid look sh watchd th boy sh lovd in th arms
of th man sh lovd. Nicholas also noticd that look and, as if
undrstanding it, flushd with plasur and bgan to kiss th boy with
good naturd playfulnss.
As sh was in mourning Princss Mary did not go out into socity, and
Nicholas did not think it th propr thing to visit hr again; but all
th sam th govrnor’s wif wnt on with hr matchmaking, passing on to
Nicholas th flattring things Princss Mary said of him and vic
vrsa, and insisting on his dclaring himslf to Princss Mary. For this
purpos sh arrangd a mting btwn th young popl at th bishop’s
hous bfor Mass.
Though Rostóv told th govrnor’s wif that h would not mak any
dclaration to Princss Mary, h promisd to go.
As at Tilsit Rostóv had not allowd himslf to doubt that what vrybody
considrd right was right, so now, aftr a short but sincr struggl
btwn his ffort to arrang his lif by his own sns of justic, and
in obdint submission to circumstancs, h chos th lattr and yildd
to th powr h flt irrsistibly carrying him h knw not whr. H
knw that aftr his promis to Sónya it would b what h dmd bas to
dclar his flings to Princss Mary. And h knw that h would nvr
act basly. But h also knw (or rathr flt at th bottom of his hart)
that by rsigning himslf now to th forc of circumstancs and to thos
who wr guiding him, h was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing
somthing vry important—mor important than anything h had vr don
in his lif.
Aftr mting Princss Mary, though th cours of his lif wnt on
xtrnally as bfor, all his formr amusmnts lost thir charm for him
and h oftn thought about hr. But h nvr thought about hr as h
had thought of all th young ladis without xcption whom h had mt
in socity, nor as h had for a long tim, and at on tim rapturously,
thought about Sónya. H had picturd ach of thos young ladis as
almost all honst-hartd young mn do, that is, as a possibl wif,
adapting hr in his imagination to all th conditions of marrid lif:
a whit drssing gown, his wif at th ta tabl, his wif’s carriag,
littl ons, Mamma and Papa, thir rlations to hr, and so on—and ths
picturs of th futur had givn him plasur. But with Princss Mary,
to whom thy wr trying to gt him ngagd, h could nvr pictur
anything of futur marrid lif. If h trid, his picturs smd
incongruous and fals. It mad him afraid.
CHAPTR VII
Th dradful nws of th battl of Borodinó, of our losss in killd and
woundd, and th still mor trribl nws of th loss of Moscow rachd
Vorónzh in th middl of Sptmbr. Princss Mary, having larnd of
hr brothr’s wound only from th Gaztt and having no dfinit nws of
him, prpard (so Nicholas hard, h had not sn hr again himslf) to
st off in sarch of Princ Andrw.
Whn h rcivd th nws of th battl of Borodinó and th abandonmnt
of Moscow, Rostóv was not sizd with dspair, angr, th dsir for
vnganc, or any fling of that kind, but vrything in Vorónzh
suddnly smd to him dull and tirsom, and h xprincd an
indfinit fling of sham and awkwardnss. Th convrsations h hard
smd to him insincr; h did not know how to judg all ths affairs
and flt that only in th rgimnt would vrything again bcom clar
to him. H mad hast to finish buying th horss, and oftn bcam
unrasonably angry with his srvant and squadron quartrmastr.
A fw days bfor his dpartur a spcial thanksgiving, at which
Nicholas was prsnt, was hld in th cathdral for th Russian victory.
H stood a littl bhind th govrnor and hld himslf with military
dcorum through th srvic, mditating on a grat varity of subjcts.
Whn th srvic was ovr th govrnor’s wif bckond him to hr.
“Hav you sn th princss?” sh askd, indicating with a movmnt of
hr had a lady standing on th opposit sid, byond th choir.
Nicholas immdiatly rcognizd Princss Mary not so much by th profil
h saw undr hr bonnt as by th fling of solicitud, timidity, and
pity that immdiatly ovrcam him. Princss Mary, vidntly ngrossd
by hr thoughts, was crossing hrslf for th last tim bfor laving
th church.
Nicholas lookd at hr fac with surpris. It was th sam fac h had
sn bfor, thr was th sam gnral xprssion of rfind, innr,
spiritual labor, but now it was quit diffrntly lit up. Thr was a
pathtic xprssion of sorrow, prayr, and hop in it. As had occurrd
bfor whn sh was prsnt, Nicholas wnt up to hr without waiting to
b promptd by th govrnor’s wif and not asking himslf whthr or not
it was right and propr to addrss hr hr in church, and told hr h
had hard of hr troubl and sympathizd with his whol soul. As soon as
sh hard his voic a vivid glow kindld in hr fac, lighting up both
hr sorrow and hr joy.
“Thr is on thing I wantd to tll you, Princss,” said Rostóv. “It
is that if your brothr, Princ Andrw Nikolávich, wr not living, it
would hav bn at onc announcd in th Gaztt, as h is a colonl.”
Th princss lookd at him, not grasping what h was saying, but chrd
by th xprssion of rgrtful sympathy on his fac.
“And I hav known so many cass of a splintr wound” (th Gaztt said
it was a shll) “ithr proving fatal at onc or bing vry slight,”
continud Nicholas. “W must hop for th bst, and I am sur...”
Princss Mary intrruptd him.
“Oh, that would b so drad...” sh bgan and, prvntd by agitation
from finishing, sh bnt hr had with a movmnt as gracful as
vrything sh did in his prsnc and, looking up at him gratfully,
wnt out, following hr aunt.
That vning Nicholas did not go out, but stayd at hom to sttl som
accounts with th hors dalrs. Whn h had finishd that businss it
was alrady too lat to go anywhr but still too arly to go to bd,
and for a long tim h pacd up and down th room, rflcting on his
lif, a thing h rarly did.
Princss Mary had mad an agrabl imprssion on him whn h had mt
hr in Smolnsk provinc. His having ncountrd hr in such xcptional
circumstancs, and his mothr having at on tim mntiond hr to him as
a good match, had drawn his particular attntion to hr. Whn h mt hr
again in Vorónzh th imprssion sh mad on him was not mrly plasing
but powrful. Nicholas had bn struck by th pculiar moral bauty h
obsrvd in hr at this tim. H was, howvr, prparing to go away and
it had not ntrd his had to rgrt that h was thus dpriving himslf
of chancs of mting hr. But that day’s ncountr in church had, h
flt, sunk dpr than was dsirabl for his pac of mind. That pal,
sad, rfind fac, that radiant look, thos gntl gracful gsturs,
and spcially th dp and tndr sorrow xprssd in all hr faturs
agitatd him and vokd his sympathy. In mn Rostóv could not bar to
s th xprssion of a highr spiritual lif (that was why h did not
lik Princ Andrw) and h rfrrd to it contmptuously as philosophy
and draminss, but in Princss Mary that vry sorrow which rvald
th dpth of a whol spiritual world forign to him was an irrsistibl
attraction.
“Sh must b a wondrful woman. A ral angl!” h said to himslf.
“Why am I not fr? Why was I in such a hurry with Sónya?” And h
involuntarily compard th two: th lack of spirituality in th on and
th abundanc of it in th othr—a spirituality h himslf lackd and
thrfor valud most highly. H trid to pictur what would happn wr
h fr. How h would propos to hr and how sh would bcom his wif.
But no, h could not imagin that. H flt awd, and no clar pictur
prsntd itslf to his mind. H had long ago picturd to himslf a
futur with Sónya, and that was all clar and simpl just bcaus it
had all bn thought out and h knw all thr was in Sónya, but it was
impossibl to pictur a futur with Princss Mary, bcaus h did not
undrstand hr but simply lovd hr.
Rvris about Sónya had had somthing mrry and playful in thm, but to
dram of Princss Mary was always difficult and a littl frightning.
“How sh prayd!” h thought. “It was plain that hr whol soul was in
hr prayr. Ys, that was th prayr that movs mountains, and I am
sur hr prayr will b answrd. Why don’t I pray for what I want?” h
suddnly thought. “What do I want? To b fr, rlasd from Sónya...
Sh was right,” h thought, rmmbring what th govrnor’s wif had
said: “Nothing but misfortun can com of marrying Sónya. Muddls,
grif for Mamma... businss difficultis... muddls, trribl muddls!
Bsids, I don’t lov hr—not as I should. O, God! rlas m from
this dradful, inxtricabl position!” h suddnly bgan to pray. “Ys,
prayr can mov mountains, but on must hav faith and not pray as
Natásha and I usd to as childrn, that th snow might turn into
sugar—and thn run out into th yard to s whthr it had don so. No,
but I am not praying for trifls now,” h thought as h put his pip
down in a cornr, and folding his hands placd himslf bfor th icon.
Softnd by mmoris of Princss Mary h bgan to pray as h had not
don for a long tim. Tars wr in his ys and in his throat whn th
door opnd and Lavrúshka cam in with som paprs.
“Blockhad! Why do you com in without bing calld?” crid Nicholas,
quickly changing his attitud.
“From th govrnor,” said Lavrúshka in a slpy voic. “A courir has
arrivd and thr’s a lttr for you.”
“Wll, all right, thanks. You can go!”
Nicholas took th two lttrs, on of which was from his mothr and
th othr from Sónya. H rcognizd thm by th handwriting and opnd
Sónya’s first. H had rad only a fw lins whn h turnd pal and his
ys opnd wid with far and joy.
“No, it’s not possibl!” h crid aloud.
Unabl to sit still h pacd up and down th room holding th lttr and
rading it. H glancd through it, thn rad it again, and thn again,
and standing still in th middl of th room h raisd his shouldrs,
strtching out his hands, with his mouth wid opn and his ys fixd.
What h had just bn praying for with confidnc that God would har
him had com to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonishd as if it wr
somthing xtraordinary and unxpctd, and as if th vry fact that it
had happnd so quickly provd that it had not com from God to whom h
had prayd, but by som ordinary coincidnc.
This unxpctd and, as it smd to Nicholas, quit voluntary lttr
from Sónya frd him from th knot that fttrd him and from which
thr had smd no scap. Sh wrot that th last unfortunat
vnts—th loss of almost th whol of th Rostóvs’ Moscow proprty—and
th countss’ rpatdly xprssd wish that Nicholas should marry
Princss Bolkónskaya, togthr with his silnc and coldnss of lat,
had all combind to mak hr dcid to rlas him from his promis and
st him compltly fr.
It would b too painful to m to think that I might b a caus of sorrow
or discord in th family that has bn so good to m (sh wrot), and my
lov has no aim but th happinss of thos I lov; so, Nicholas, I
bg you to considr yourslf fr, and to b assurd that, in spit of
vrything, no on can lov you mor than dos
Your Sónya
Both lttrs wr writtn from Tróitsa. Th othr, from th countss,
dscribd thir last days in Moscow, thir dpartur, th fir, and
th dstruction of all thir proprty. In this lttr th countss also
mntiond that Princ Andrw was among th woundd travling with thm;
his stat was vry critical, but th doctor said thr was now mor
hop. Sónya and Natásha wr nursing him.
Nxt day Nicholas took his mothr’s lttr and wnt to s Princss
Mary. Nithr h nor sh said a word about what “Natásha nursing him”
might man, but thanks to this lttr Nicholas suddnly bcam almost as
intimat with th princss as if thy wr rlations.
Th following day h saw Princss Mary off on hr journy to Yaroslávl,
and a fw days latr lft to rjoin his rgimnt.
CHAPTR VIII
Sónya’s lttr writtn from Tróitsa, which had com as an answr to
Nicholas’ prayr, was promptd by this: th thought of gtting Nicholas
marrid to an hirss occupid th old countss’ mind mor and mor. Sh
knw that Sónya was th chif obstacl to this happning, and Sónya’s
lif in th countss’ hous had grown hardr and hardr, spcially
aftr thy had rcivd a lttr from Nicholas tlling of his mting
with Princss Mary in Boguchárovo. Th countss lt no occasion slip of
making humiliating or crul allusions to Sónya.
But a fw days bfor thy lft Moscow, movd and xcitd by all that
was going on, sh calld Sónya to hr and, instad of rproaching and
making dmands on hr, tarfully implord hr to sacrific hrslf
and rpay all that th family had don for hr by braking off hr
ngagmnt with Nicholas.
“I shall not b at pac till you promis m this.”
Sónya burst into hystrical tars and rplid through hr sobs that
sh would do anything and was prpard for anything, but gav no actual
promis and could not bring hrslf to dcid to do what was dmandd
of hr. Sh must sacrific hrslf for th family that had rard and
brought hr up. To sacrific hrslf for othrs was Sónya’s habit. Hr
position in th hous was such that only by sacrific could sh show hr
worth, and sh was accustomd to this and lovd doing it. But in all hr
formr acts of slf-sacrific sh had bn happily conscious that thy
raisd hr in hr own stm and in that of othrs, and so mad hr mor
worthy of Nicholas whom sh lovd mor than anything in th world. But
now thy wantd hr to sacrific th vry thing that constitutd th
whol rward for hr slf-sacrific and th whol maning of hr lif.
And for th first tim sh flt bittrnss against thos who had bn
hr bnfactors only to tortur hr th mor painfully; sh flt jalous
of Natásha who had nvr xprincd anything of this sort, had nvr
ndd to sacrific hrslf, but mad othrs sacrific thmslvs for
hr and yt was blovd by vrybody. And for th first tim Sónya flt
that out of hr pur, quit lov for Nicholas a passionat fling
was bginning to grow up which was strongr than principl, virtu,
or rligion. Undr th influnc of this fling Sónya, whos lif of
dpndnc had taught hr involuntarily to b scrtiv, having answrd
th countss in vagu gnral trms, avoidd talking with hr and
rsolvd to wait till sh should s Nicholas, not in ordr to st him
fr but on th contrary at that mting to bind him to hr forvr.
Th bustl and trror of th Rostóvs’ last days in Moscow stifld th
gloomy thoughts that opprssd Sónya. Sh was glad to find scap
from thm in practical activity. But whn sh hard of Princ Andrw’s
prsnc in thir hous, dspit hr sincr pity for him and for
Natásha, sh was sizd by a joyful and suprstitious fling that God
did not intnd hr to b sparatd from Nicholas. Sh knw that Natásha
lovd no on but Princ Andrw and had nvr casd to lov him. Sh
knw that bing thrown togthr again undr such trribl circumstancs
thy would again fall in lov with on anothr, and that Nicholas would
thn not b abl to marry Princss Mary as thy would b within th
prohibitd dgrs of affinity. Dspit all th trror of what had
happnd during thos last days and during th first days of thir
journy, this fling that Providnc was intrvning in hr prsonal
affairs chrd Sónya.
At th Tróitsa monastry th Rostóvs first brok thir journy for a
whol day.
Thr larg rooms wr assignd to thm in th monastry hostlry, on
of which was occupid by Princ Andrw. Th woundd man was much bttr
that day and Natásha was sitting with him. In th nxt room sat th
count and countss rspctfully convrsing with th prior, who was
calling on thm as old acquaintancs and bnfactors of th monastry.
Sónya was thr too, tormntd by curiosity as to what Princ Andrw and
Natásha wr talking about. Sh hard th sound of thir voics through
th door. That door opnd and Natásha cam out, looking xcitd. Not
noticing th monk, who had risn to grt hr and was drawing back th
wid slv on his right arm, sh wnt up to Sónya and took hr hand.
“Natásha, what ar you about? Com hr!” said th countss.
Natásha wnt up to th monk for his blssing, and h advisd hr to pray
for aid to God and His saint.
As soon as th prior withdrw, Natásha took hr frind by th hand and
wnt with hr into th unoccupid room.
“Sónya, will h liv?” sh askd. “Sónya, how happy I am, and how
unhappy!... Sónya, dovy, vrything is as it usd to b. If only h
livs! H cannot... bcaus... bcaus... of...” and Natásha burst into
tars.
“Ys! I knw it! Thank God!” murmurd Sónya. “H will liv.”
Sónya was not lss agitatd than hr frind by th lattr’s far and
grif and by hr own prsonal flings which sh shard with no on.
Sobbing, sh kissd and comfortd Natásha. “If only h livs!” sh
thought. Having wpt, talkd, and wipd away thir tars, th two
frinds wnt togthr to Princ Andrw’s door. Natásha opnd it
cautiously and glancd into th room, Sónya standing bsid hr at th
half-opn door.
Princ Andrw was lying raisd high on thr pillows. His pal fac was
calm, his ys closd, and thy could s his rgular brathing.
“O, Natásha!” Sónya suddnly almost scramd, catching hr companion’s
arm and stpping back from th door.
“What? What is it?” askd Natásha.
“It’s that, that...” said Sónya, with a whit fac and trmbling lips.
Natásha softly closd th door and wnt with Sónya to th window, not
yt undrstanding what th lattr was tlling hr.
“You rmmbr,” said Sónya with a solmn and frightnd xprssion.
“You rmmbr whn I lookd in th mirror for you... at Otrádno at
Christmas? Do you rmmbr what I saw?”
“Ys, ys!” crid Natásha opning hr ys wid, and vaguly rcalling
that Sónya had told hr somthing about Princ Andrw whom sh had sn
lying down.
“You rmmbr?” Sónya wnt on. “I saw it thn and told vrybody, you
and Dunyásha. I saw him lying on a bd,” said sh, making a gstur with
hr hand and a liftd fingr at ach dtail, “and that h had his ys
closd and was covrd just with a pink quilt, and that his hands wr
foldd,” sh concludd, convincing hrslf that th dtails sh had just
sn wr xactly what sh had sn in th mirror.
Sh had in fact sn nothing thn but had mntiond th first thing that
cam into hr had, but what sh had invntd thn smd to hr now
as ral as any othr rcollction. Sh not only rmmbrd what sh had
thn said—that h turnd to look at hr and smild and was covrd with
somthing rd—but was firmly convincd that sh had thn sn and said
that h was covrd with a pink quilt and that his ys wr closd.
“Ys, ys, it rally was pink!” crid Natásha, who now thought sh
too rmmbrd th word pink bing usd, and saw in this th most
xtraordinary and mystrious part of th prdiction.
“But what dos it man?” sh addd mditativly.
“Oh, I don’t know, it is all so strang,” rplid Sónya, clutching at
hr had.
A fw minuts latr Princ Andrw rang and Natásha wnt to him, but
Sónya, fling unusually xcitd and touchd, rmaind at th window
thinking about th strangnss of what had occurrd.
Thy had an opportunity that day to snd lttrs to th army, and th
countss was writing to hr son.
“Sónya!” said th countss, raising hr ys from hr lttr as hr
nic passd, “Sónya, won’t you writ to Nicholas?” Sh spok in a soft,
trmulous voic, and in th wary ys that lookd ovr hr spctacls
Sónya rad all that th countss mant to convy with ths words. Thos
ys xprssd ntraty, sham at having to ask, far of a rfusal, and
radinss for rlntlss hatrd in cas of such rfusal.
Sónya wnt up to th countss and, knling down, kissd hr hand.
“Ys, Mamma, I will writ,” said sh.
Sónya was softnd, xcitd, and touchd by all that had occurrd that
day, spcially by th mystrious fulfillmnt sh had just sn of hr
vision. Now that sh knw that th rnwal of Natásha’s rlations with
Princ Andrw would prvnt Nicholas from marrying Princss Mary, sh
was joyfully conscious of a rturn of that slf-sacrificing spirit in
which sh was accustomd to liv and lovd to liv. So with a joyful
consciousnss of prforming a magnanimous dd—intrruptd svral tims
by th tars that dimmd hr vlvty black ys—sh wrot that touching
lttr th arrival of which had so amazd Nicholas.
CHAPTR IX
Th officr and soldirs who had arrstd Pirr tratd him with
hostility but yt with rspct, in th guardhous to which h was takn.
In thir attitud toward him could still b flt both uncrtainty as
to who h might b—prhaps a vry important prson—and hostility as a
rsult of thir rcnt prsonal conflict with him.
But whn th guard was rlivd nxt morning, Pirr flt that for th
nw guard—both officrs and mn—h was not as intrsting as h had
bn to his captors; and in fact th guard of th scond day did not
rcogniz in this big, stout man in a pasant coat th vigorous prson
who had fought so dspratly with th maraudr and th convoy and had
uttrd thos solmn words about saving a child; thy saw in him only
No. 17 of th capturd Russians, arrstd and dtaind for som rason
by ordr of th Highr Command. If thy noticd anything rmarkabl
about Pirr, it was only his unabashd, mditativ concntration
and thoughtfulnss, and th way h spok Frnch, which struck thm as
surprisingly good. In spit of this h was placd that day with th
othr arrstd suspcts, as th sparat room h had occupid was
rquird by an officr.
All th Russians confind with Pirr wr mn of th lowst class and,
rcognizing him as a gntlman, thy all avoidd him, mor spcially as
h spok Frnch. Pirr flt sad at haring thm making fun of him.
That vning h larnd that all ths prisonrs (h, probably, among
thm) wr to b trid for incndiarism. On th third day h was takn
with th othrs to a hous whr a Frnch gnral with a whit mustach
sat with two colonls and othr Frnchmn with scarvs on thir arms.
With th prcision and dfinitnss customary in addrssing prisonrs,
and which is supposd to prclud human frailty, Pirr lik th othrs
was qustiond as to who h was, whr h had bn, with what objct,
and so on.
Ths qustions, lik qustions put at trials gnrally, lft th
ssnc of th mattr asid, shut out th possibility of that ssnc’s
bing rvald, and wr dsignd only to form a channl through which
th judgs wishd th answrs of th accusd to flow so as to lad to
th dsird rsult, namly a conviction. As soon as Pirr bgan to say
anything that did not fit in with that aim, th channl was rmovd and
th watr could flow to wast. Pirr flt, morovr, what th accusd
always fl at thir trial, prplxity as to why ths qustions wr
put to him. H had a fling that it was only out of condscnsion or a
kind of civility that this dvic of placing a channl was mployd. H
knw h was in ths mn’s powr, that only by forc had thy brought
him thr, that forc alon gav thm th right to dmand answrs
to thir qustions, and that th sol objct of that assmbly was to
inculpat him. And so, as thy had th powr and wish to inculpat
him, this xpdint of an inquiry and trial smd unncssary. It was
vidnt that any answr would lad to conviction. Whn askd what h
was doing whn h was arrstd, Pirr rplid in a rathr tragic mannr
that h was rstoring to its parnts a child h had savd from th
flams. Why had h fought th maraudr? Pirr answrd that h “was
protcting a woman,” and that “to protct a woman who was bing insultd
was th duty of vry man; that...” Thy intrruptd him, for this
was not to th point. Why was h in th yard of a burning hous whr
witnsss had sn him? H rplid that h had gon out to s what
was happning in Moscow. Again thy intrruptd him: thy had not askd
whr h was going, but why h was found nar th fir? Who was h? thy
askd, rpating thir first qustion, which h had dclind to answr.
Again h rplid that h could not answr it.
“Put that down, that’s bad... vry bad,” strnly rmarkd th gnral
with th whit mustach and rd flushd fac.
On th fourth day firs brok out on th Zúbovski rampart.
Pirr and thirtn othrs wr movd to th coach hous of a mrchant’s
hous nar th Criman bridg. On his way through th strts Pirr
flt stifld by th smok which smd to hang ovr th whol
city. Firs wr visibl on all sids. H did not thn raliz th
significanc of th burning of Moscow, and lookd at th firs with
horror.
H passd four days in th coach hous nar th Criman bridg and
during that tim larnd, from th talk of th Frnch soldirs, that all
thos confind thr wr awaiting a dcision which might com any day
from th marshal. What marshal this was, Pirr could not larn from th
soldirs. vidntly for thm “th marshal” rprsntd a vry high and
rathr mystrious powr.
Ths first days, bfor th ighth of Sptmbr whn th prisonrs wr
had up for a scond xamination, wr th hardst of all for Pirr.
CHAPTR X
On th ighth of Sptmbr an officr—a vry important on judging by
th rspct th guards showd him—ntrd th coach hous whr th
prisonrs wr. This officr, probably somon on th staff, was holding
a papr in his hand, and calld ovr all th Russians thr, naming
Pirr as “th man who dos not giv his nam.” Glancing indolntly and
indiffrntly at all th prisonrs, h ordrd th officr in charg
to hav thm dcntly drssd and tidid up bfor taking thm to th
marshal. An hour latr a squad of soldirs arrivd and Pirr with
thirtn othrs was ld to th Virgin’s Fild. It was a fin day, sunny
aftr rain, and th air was unusually pur. Th smok did not hang low
as on th day whn Pirr had bn takn from th guardhous on th
Zúbovski rampart, but ros through th pur air in columns. No flams
wr sn, but columns of smok ros on all sids, and all Moscow as far
as Pirr could s was on vast charrd ruin. On all sids thr wr
wast spacs with only stovs and chimny stacks still standing, and
hr and thr th blacknd walls of som brick houss. Pirr gazd
at th ruins and did not rcogniz districts h had known wll. Hr and
thr h could s churchs that had not bn burnd. Th Krmlin, which
was not dstroyd, glamd whit in th distanc with its towrs and
th blfry of Iván th Grat. Th doms of th Nw Convnt of th Virgin
glittrd brightly and its blls wr ringing particularly clarly.
Ths blls rmindd Pirr that it was Sunday and th fast of th
Nativity of th Virgin. But thr smd to b no on to clbrat this
holiday: vrywhr wr blacknd ruins, and th fw Russians to b
sn wr tattrd and frightnd popl who trid to hid whn thy saw
th Frnch.
It was plain that th Russian nst was ruind and dstroyd, but in
plac of th Russian ordr of lif that had bn dstroyd, Pirr
unconsciously flt that a quit diffrnt, firm, Frnch ordr had bn
stablishd ovr this ruind nst. H flt this in th looks of
th soldirs who, marching in rgular ranks briskly and gaily, wr
scorting him and th othr criminals; h flt it in th looks of an
important Frnch official in a carriag and pair drivn by a soldir,
whom thy mt on th way. H flt it in th mrry sounds of rgimntal
music h hard from th lft sid of th fild, and flt and ralizd
it spcially from th list of prisonrs th Frnch officr had rad out
whn h cam that morning. Pirr had bn takn by on st of soldirs
and ld first to on and thn to anothr plac with dozns of othr mn,
and it smd that thy might hav forgottn him, or confusd him with
th othrs. But no: th answrs h had givn whn qustiond had com
back to him in his dsignation as “th man who dos not giv his nam,”
and undr that appllation, which to Pirr smd trribl, thy wr
now lading him somwhr with unhsitating assuranc on thir facs
that h and all th othr prisonrs wr xactly th ons thy wantd
and that thy wr bing takn to th propr plac. Pirr flt himslf
to b an insignificant chip falln among th whls of a machin whos
action h did not undrstand but which was working wll.
H and th othr prisonrs wr takn to th right sid of th Virgin’s
Fild, to a larg whit hous with an immns gardn not far from th
convnt. This was Princ Shchrbátov’s hous, whr Pirr had oftn
bn in othr days, and which, as h larnd from th talk of th
soldirs, was now occupid by th marshal, th Duk of ckmühl (Davout).
Thy wr takn to th ntranc and ld into th hous on by on.
Pirr was th sixth to ntr. H was conductd through a glass gallry,
an antroom, and a hall, which wr familiar to him, into a long low
study at th door of which stood an adjutant.
Davout, spctacls on nos, sat bnt ovr a tabl at th furthr nd of
th room. Pirr wnt clos up to him, but Davout, vidntly consulting
a papr that lay bfor him, did not look up. Without raising his ys,
h said in a low voic:
“Who ar you?”
Pirr was silnt bcaus h was incapabl of uttring a word. To him
Davout was not mrly a Frnch gnral, but a man notorious for his
crulty. Looking at his cold fac, as h sat lik a strn schoolmastr
who was prpard to wait awhil for an answr, Pirr flt that vry
instant of dlay might cost him his lif; but h did not know what
to say. H did not vntur to rpat what h had said at his first
xamination, yt to disclos his rank and position was dangrous and
mbarrassing. So h was silnt. But bfor h had dcidd what to do,
Davout raisd his had, pushd his spctacls back on his forhad,
scrwd up his ys, and lookd intntly at him.
“I know that man,” h said in a cold, masurd ton, vidntly
calculatd to frightn Pirr.
Th chill that had bn running down Pirr’s back now sizd his had
as in a vis.
“You cannot know m, Gnral, I hav nvr sn you...”
“H is a Russian spy,” Davout intrruptd, addrssing anothr gnral
who was prsnt, but whom Pirr had not noticd.
Davout turnd away. With an unxpctd rvrbration in his voic Pirr
rapidly bgan:
“No, monsignur,” h said, suddnly rmmbring that Davout was a duk.
“No, monsignur, you cannot hav known m. I am a militia officr and
hav not quittd Moscow.”
“Your nam?” askd Davout.
“Bzúkhov.”
“What proof hav I that you ar not lying?”
“Monsignur!” xclaimd Pirr, not in an offndd but in a plading
voic.
Davout lookd up and gazd intntly at him. For som sconds thy lookd
at on anothr, and that look savd Pirr. Apart from conditions of war
and law, that look stablishd human rlations btwn th two mn. At
that momnt an immns numbr of things passd dimly through both thir
minds, and thy ralizd that thy wr both childrn of humanity and
wr brothrs.
At th first glanc, whn Davout had only raisd his had from th
paprs whr human affairs and livs wr indicatd by numbrs, Pirr
was mrly a circumstanc, and Davout could hav shot him without
burdning his conscinc with an vil dd, but now h saw in him a
human bing. H rflctd for a momnt.
“How can you show m that you ar tlling th truth?” said Davout
coldly.
Pirr rmmbrd Ramball, and namd him and his rgimnt and th
strt whr th hous was.
“You ar not what you say,” rturnd Davout.
In a trmbling, faltring voic Pirr bgan adducing proofs of th
truth of his statmnts.
But at that momnt an adjutant ntrd and rportd somthing to Davout.
Davout brightnd up at th nws th adjutant brought, and bgan
buttoning up his uniform. It smd that h had quit forgottn Pirr.
Whn th adjutant rmindd him of th prisonr, h jrkd his had in
Pirr’s dirction with a frown and ordrd him to b ld away. But
whr thy wr to tak him Pirr did not know: back to th coach hous
or to th plac of xcution his companions had pointd out to him as
thy crossd th Virgin’s Fild.
H turnd his had and saw that th adjutant was putting anothr
qustion to Davout.
“Ys, of cours!” rplid Davout, but what this “ys” mant, Pirr did
not know.
Pirr could not aftrwards rmmbr how h wnt, whthr it was far, or
in which dirction. His facultis wr quit numbd, h was stupfid,
and noticing nothing around him wnt on moving his lgs as th othrs
did till thy all stoppd and h stoppd too. Th only thought in his
mind at that tim was: who was it that had rally sntncd him to
dath? Not th mn on th commission that had first xamind him—not on
of thm wishd to or, vidntly, could hav don it. It was not Davout,
who had lookd at him in so human a way. In anothr momnt Davout would
hav ralizd that h was doing wrong, but just thn th adjutant had
com in and intrruptd him. Th adjutant, also, had vidntly had no
vil intnt though h might hav rfraind from coming in. Thn who was
xcuting him, killing him, dpriving him of lif—him, Pirr, with all
his mmoris, aspirations, hops, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And
Pirr flt that it was no on.
It was a systm—a concurrnc of circumstancs.
A systm of som sort was killing him—Pirr—dpriving him of lif, of
vrything, annihilating him.
CHAPTR XI
From Princ Shchrbátov’s hous th prisonrs wr ld straight down th
Virgin’s Fild, to th lft of th nunnry, as far as a kitchn gardn
in which a post had bn st up. Byond that post a frsh pit had bn
dug in th ground, and nar th post and th pit a larg crowd stood
in a smicircl. Th crowd consistd of a fw Russians and many
of Napolon’s soldirs who wr not on duty—Grmans, Italians, and
Frnchmn, in a varity of uniforms. To th right and lft of th post
stood rows of Frnch troops in blu uniforms with rd paults and high
boots and shakos.
Th prisonrs wr placd in a crtain ordr, according to th list
(Pirr was sixth), and wr ld to th post. Svral drums suddnly
bgan to bat on both sids of thm, and at that sound Pirr flt as
if part of his soul had bn torn away. H lost th powr of thinking or
undrstanding. H could only har and s. And h had only on wish—that
th frightful thing that had to happn should happn quickly. Pirr
lookd round at his fllow prisonrs and scrutinizd thm.
Th two first wr convicts with shavn hads. On was tall and thin,
th othr dark, shaggy, and sinwy, with a flat nos. Th third was
a domstic srf, about forty-fiv yars old, with grizzld hair and a
plump, wll-nourishd body. Th fourth was a pasant, a vry handsom
man with a broad, light-brown bard and black ys. Th fifth was a
factory hand, a thin, sallow-facd lad of ightn in a loos coat.
Pirr hard th Frnch consulting whthr to shoot thm sparatly or
two at a tim. “In coupls,” rplid th officr in command in a calm
voic. Thr was a stir in th ranks of th soldirs and it was vidnt
that thy wr all hurrying—not as mn hurry to do somthing thy
undrstand, but as popl hurry to finish a ncssary but unplasant and
incomprhnsibl task.
A Frnch official waring a scarf cam up to th right of th row of
prisonrs and rad out th sntnc in Russian and in Frnch.
Thn two pairs of Frnchmn approachd th criminals and at th
officr’s command took th two convicts who stood first in th row. Th
convicts stoppd whn thy rachd th post and, whil sacks wr bing
brought, lookd dumbly around as a woundd bast looks at an approaching
huntsman. On crossd himslf continually, th othr scratchd his back
and mad a movmnt of th lips rsmbling a smil. With hurrid hands
th soldirs blindfoldd thm, drawing th sacks ovr thir hads, and
bound thm to th post.
Twlv sharpshootrs with muskts stppd out of th ranks with a firm
rgular trad and haltd ight pacs from th post. Pirr turnd away
to avoid sing what was going to happn. Suddnly a crackling, rolling
nois was hard which smd to him loudr than th most trrific
thundr, and h lookd round. Thr was som smok, and th Frnchmn
wr doing somthing nar th pit, with pal facs and trmbling hands.
Two mor prisonrs wr ld up. In th sam way and with similar looks,
ths two glancd vainly at th onlookrs with only a silnt appal for
protction in thir ys, vidntly unabl to undrstand or bliv
what was going to happn to thm. Thy could not bliv it bcaus thy
alon knw what thir lif mant to thm, and so thy nithr undrstood
nor blivd that it could b takn from thm.
Again Pirr did not wish to look and again turnd away; but again th
sound as of a frightful xplosion struck his ar, and at th sam momnt
h saw smok, blood, and th pal, scard facs of th Frnchmn who
wr again doing somthing by th post, thir trmbling hands impding
on anothr. Pirr, brathing havily, lookd around as if asking what
it mant. Th sam qustion was xprssd in all th looks that mt his.
On th facs of all th Russians and of th Frnch soldirs and officrs
without xcption, h rad th sam dismay, horror, and conflict that
wr in his own hart. “But who, aftr all, is doing this? Thy ar all
suffring as I am. Who thn is it? Who?” flashd for an instant through
his mind.
“Sharpshootrs of th 86th, forward!” shoutd somon. Th fifth
prisonr, th on nxt to Pirr, was ld away—alon. Pirr did not
undrstand that h was savd, that h and th rst had bn brought
thr only to witnss th xcution. With vr-growing horror, and no
sns of joy or rlif, h gazd at what was taking plac. Th fifth man
was th factory lad in th loos cloak. Th momnt thy laid hands on
him h sprang asid in trror and clutchd at Pirr. (Pirr shuddrd
and shook himslf fr.) Th lad was unabl to walk. Thy draggd him
along, holding him up undr th arms, and h scramd. Whn thy got
him to th post h grw quit, as if h suddnly undrstood somthing.
Whthr h undrstood that scraming was uslss or whthr h thought
it incrdibl that mn should kill him, at any rat h took his stand at
th post, waiting to b blindfoldd lik th othrs, and lik a woundd
animal lookd around him with glittring ys.
Pirr was no longr abl to turn away and clos his ys. His curiosity
and agitation, lik that of th whol crowd, rachd th highst pitch
at this fifth murdr. Lik th othrs this fifth man smd calm; h
wrappd his loos cloak closr and rubbd on bar foot with th othr.
Whn thy bgan to blindfold him h himslf adjustd th knot which
hurt th back of his had; thn whn thy proppd him against th
bloodstaind post, h land back and, not bing comfortabl in that
position, straightnd himslf, adjustd his ft, and land back again
mor comfortably. Pirr did not tak his ys from him and did not miss
his slightst movmnt.
Probably a word of command was givn and was followd by th rports of
ight muskts; but try as h would Pirr could not aftrwards rmmbr
having hard th slightst sound of th shots. H only saw how th
workman suddnly sank down on th cords that hld him, how blood showd
itslf in two placs, how th rops slacknd undr th wight of th
hanging body, and how th workman sat down, his had hanging unnaturally
and on lg bnt undr him. Pirr ran up to th post. No on hindrd
him. Pal, frightnd popl wr doing somthing around th workman.
Th lowr jaw of an old Frnchman with a thick mustach trmbld as h
untid th rops. Th body collapsd. Th soldirs draggd it awkwardly
from th post and bgan pushing it into th pit.
Thy all plainly and crtainly knw that thy wr criminals who must
hid th tracs of thir guilt as quickly as possibl.
Pirr glancd into th pit and saw that th factory lad was lying with
his kns clos up to his had and on shouldr highr than th othr.
That shouldr ros and fll rhythmically and convulsivly, but spadfuls
of arth wr alrady bing thrown ovr th whol body. On of th
soldirs, vidntly suffring, shoutd gruffly and angrily at Pirr to
go back. But Pirr did not undrstand him and rmaind nar th post,
and no on drov him away.
Whn th pit had bn filld up a command was givn. Pirr was takn
back to his plac, and th rows of troops on both sids of th post
mad a half turn and wnt past it at a masurd pac. Th twnty-four
sharpshootrs with dischargd muskts, standing in th cntr of th
circl, ran back to thir placs as th companis passd by.
Pirr gazd now with dazd ys at ths sharpshootrs who ran in
coupls out of th circl. All but on rjoind thir companis. This
on, a young soldir, his fac dadly pal, his shako pushd back, and
his muskt rsting on th ground, still stood nar th pit at th spot
from which h had fird. H swayd lik a drunkn man, taking som stps
forward and back to sav himslf from falling. An old, noncommissiond
officr ran out of th ranks and taking him by th lbow draggd him to
his company. Th crowd of Russians and Frnchmn bgan to disprs. Thy
all wnt away silntly and with drooping hads.
“That will tach thm to start firs,” said on of th Frnchmn.
Pirr glancd round at th spakr and saw that it was a soldir who
was trying to find som rlif aftr what had bn don, but was not
abl to do so. Without finishing what h had bgun to say h mad a
hoplss movmnt with his arm and wnt away.
CHAPTR XII
Aftr th xcution Pirr was sparatd from th rst of th prisonrs
and placd alon in a small, ruind, and bfould church.
Toward vning a noncommissiond officr ntrd with two soldirs and
told him that h had bn pardond and would now go to th barracks for
th prisonrs of war. Without undrstanding what was said to him, Pirr
got up and wnt with th soldirs. Thy took him to th uppr nd of th
fild, whr thr wr som shds built of charrd planks, bams,
and battns, and ld him into on of thm. In th darknss som twnty
diffrnt mn surroundd Pirr. H lookd at thm without undrstanding
who thy wr, why thy wr thr, or what thy wantd of him. H hard
what thy said, but did not undrstand th maning of th words and
mad no kind of dduction from or application of thm. H rplid to
qustions thy put to him, but did not considr who was listning to his
rplis, nor how thy would undrstand thm. H lookd at thir facs
and figurs, but thy all smd to him qually maninglss.
From th momnt Pirr had witnssd thos trribl murdrs committd by
mn who did not wish to commit thm, it was as if th mainspring of
his lif, on which vrything dpndd and which mad vrything appar
aliv, had suddnly bn wrnchd out and vrything had collapsd
into a hap of maninglss rubbish. Though h did not acknowldg it to
himslf, his faith in th right ordring of th univrs, in humanity,
in his own soul, and in God, had bn dstroyd. H had xprincd this
bfor, but nvr so strongly as now. Whn similar doubts had assaild
him bfor, thy had bn th rsult of his own wrongdoing, and at th
bottom of his hart h had flt that rlif from his dspair and from
thos doubts was to b found within himslf. But now h flt that
th univrs had crumbld bfor his ys and only maninglss ruins
rmaind, and this not by any fault of his own. H flt that it was not
in his powr to rgain faith in th maning of lif.
Around him in th darknss mn wr standing and vidntly somthing
about him intrstd thm gratly. Thy wr tlling him somthing and
asking him somthing. Thn thy ld him away somwhr, and at last h
found himslf in a cornr of th shd among mn who wr laughing and
talking on all sids.
“Wll, thn, mats... that vry princ who...” som voic at th othr
nd of th shd was saying, with a strong mphasis on th word who.
Sitting silnt and motionlss on a hap of straw against th wall,
Pirr somtims opnd and somtims closd his ys. But as soon as
h closd thm h saw bfor him th dradful fac of th factory
lad—spcially dradful bcaus of its simplicity—and th facs of th
murdrrs, vn mor dradful bcaus of thir disquit. And h opnd
his ys again and stard vacantly into th darknss around him.
Bsid him in a stooping position sat a small man of whos prsnc h
was first mad awar by a strong smll of prspiration which cam from
him vry tim h movd. This man was doing somthing to his lgs in th
darknss, and though Pirr could not s his fac h flt that th man
continually glancd at him. On growing usd to th darknss Pirr saw
that th man was taking off his lg bands, and th way h did it arousd
Pirr’s intrst.
Having unwound th string that tid th band on on lg, h carfully
coild it up and immdiatly st to work on th othr lg, glancing up
at Pirr. Whil on hand hung up th first string th othr was alrady
unwinding th band on th scond lg. In this way, having carfully
rmovd th lg bands by dft circular motions of his arm following
on anothr unintrruptdly, th man hung th lg bands up on som pgs
fixd abov his had. Thn h took out a knif, cut somthing, closd
th knif, placd it undr th had of his bd, and, sating himslf
comfortably, claspd his arms round his liftd kns and fixd his ys
on Pirr. Th lattr was conscious of somthing plasant, comforting,
and wll-roundd in ths dft movmnts, in th man’s wll-ordrd
arrangmnts in his cornr, and vn in his vry smll, and h lookd at
th man without taking his ys from him.
“You’v sn a lot of troubl, sir, h?” th littl man suddnly said.
And thr was so much kindlinss and simplicity in his singsong voic
that Pirr trid to rply, but his jaw trmbld and h flt tars
rising to his ys. Th littl fllow, giving Pirr no tim to btray
his confusion, instantly continud in th sam plasant tons:
“h, lad, don’t frt!” said h, in th tndr singsong carssing voic
old Russian pasant womn mploy. “Don’t frt, frind—‘suffr an hour,
liv for an ag!’ that’s how it is, my dar fllow. And hr w liv,
thank havn, without offns. Among ths folk, too, thr ar good
mn as wll as bad,” said h, and still spaking, h turnd on his kns
with a suppl movmnt, got up, coughd, and wnt off to anothr part of
th shd.
“h, you rascal!” Pirr hard th sam kind voic saying at th othr
nd of th shd. “So you’v com, you rascal? Sh rmmbrs... Now, now,
that’ll do!”
And th soldir, pushing away a littl dog that was jumping up at
him, rturnd to his plac and sat down. In his hands h had somthing
wrappd in a rag.
“Hr, at a bit, sir,” said h, rsuming his formr rspctful ton as
h unwrappd and offrd Pirr som bakd potatos. “W had soup for
dinnr and th potatos ar grand!”
Pirr had not atn all day and th smll of th potatos smd
xtrmly plasant to him. H thankd th soldir and bgan to at.
“Wll, ar thy all right?” said th soldir with a smil. “You should
do lik this.”
H took a potato, drw out his clasp knif, cut th potato into two
qual halvs on th palm of his hand, sprinkld som salt on it from th
rag, and handd it to Pirr.
“Th potatos ar grand!” h said onc mor. “at som lik that!”
Pirr thought h had nvr atn anything that tastd bttr.
“Oh, I’m all right,” said h, “but why did thy shoot thos poor
fllows? Th last on was hardly twnty.”
“Tss, tt...!” said th littl man. “Ah, what a sin... what a sin!” h
addd quickly, and as if his words wr always waiting rady in his
mouth and flw out involuntarily h wnt on: “How was it, sir, that you
stayd in Moscow?”
“I didn’t think thy would com so soon. I stayd accidntally,” rplid
Pirr.
“And how did thy arrst you, dar lad? At your hous?”
“No, I wnt to look at th fir, and thy arrstd m thr, and trid
m as an incndiary.”
“Whr thr’s law thr’s injustic,” put in th littl man.
“And hav you bn hr long?” Pirr askd as h munchd th last of
th potato.
“I? It was last Sunday thy took m, out of a hospital in Moscow.”
“Why, ar you a soldir thn?”
“Ys, w ar soldirs of th Ápshron rgimnt. I was dying of fvr. W
wrn’t told anything. Thr wr som twnty of us lying thr. W had
no ida, nvr gussd at all.”
“And do you fl sad hr?” Pirr inquird.
“How can on hlp it, lad? My nam is Platón, and th surnam is
Karatáv,” h addd, vidntly wishing to mak it asir for Pirr to
addrss him. “Thy call m ‘littl falcon’ in th rgimnt. How is on
to hlp fling sad? Moscow—sh’s th mothr of citis. How can on s
all this and not fl sad? But ‘th maggot gnaws th cabbag, yt dis
first’; that’s what th old folks usd to tll us,” h addd rapidly.
“What? What did you say?” askd Pirr.
“Who? I?” said Karatáv. “I say things happn not as w plan but as God
judgs,” h rplid, thinking that h was rpating what h had said
bfor, and immdiatly continud:
“Wll, and you, hav you a family stat, sir? And a hous? So you hav
abundanc, thn? And a houswif? And your old parnts, ar thy still
living?” h askd.
And though it was too dark for Pirr to s, h flt that a supprssd
smil of kindlinss puckrd th soldir’s lips as h put ths
qustions. H smd grivd that Pirr had no parnts, spcially that
h had no mothr.
“A wif for counsl, a mothr-in-law for wlcom, but thr’s non as
dar as on’s own mothr!” said h. “Wll, and hav you littl ons?” h
wnt on asking.
Again Pirr’s ngativ answr smd to distrss him, and h hastnd
to add:
“Nvr mind! You’r young folks yt, and plas God may still hav som.
Th grat thing is to liv in harmony....”
“But it’s all th sam now,” Pirr could not hlp saying.
“Ah, my dar fllow!” rjoind Karatáv, “nvr dclin a prison or a
bggar’s sack!”
H satd himslf mor comfortably and coughd, vidntly prparing to
tll a long story.
“Wll, my dar fllow, I was still living at hom,” h bgan. “W had
a wll-to-do homstad, plnty of land, w pasants livd wll and our
hous was on to thank God for. Whn Fathr and w wnt out mowing
thr wr svn of us. W livd wll. W wr ral pasants. It so
happnd...”
And Platón Karatáv told a long story of how h had gon into somon’s
cops to tak wood, how h had bn caught by th kpr, had bn
trid, floggd, and snt to srv as a soldir.
“Wll, lad,” and a smil changd th ton of his voic “w thought it
was a misfortun but it turnd out a blssing! If it had not bn for
my sin, my brothr would hav had to go as a soldir. But h, my youngr
brothr, had fiv littl ons, whil I, you s, only lft a wif
bhind. W had a littl girl, but God took hr bfor I wnt as a
soldir. I com hom on lav and I’ll tll you how it was, I look and
s that thy ar living bttr than bfor. Th yard full of cattl,
th womn at hom, two brothrs away arning wags, and only Michal th
youngst, at hom. Fathr, h says, ‘All my childrn ar th sam to
m: it hurts th sam whichvr fingr gts bittn. But if Platón hadn’t
bn shavd for a soldir, Michal would hav had to go.’ calld us
all to him and, will you bliv it, placd us in front of th icons.
‘Michal,’ h says, ‘com hr and bow down to his ft; and you, young
woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildrn, also bow down bfor
him! Do you undrstand?’ h says. That’s how it is, dar fllow. Fat
looks for a had. But w ar always judging, ‘that’s not wll—that’s
not right!’ Our luck is lik watr in a dragnt: you pull at it and it
bulgs, but whn you’v drawn it out it’s mpty! That’s how it is.”
And Platón shiftd his sat on th straw.
Aftr a short silnc h ros.
“Wll, I think you must b slpy,” said h, and bgan rapidly crossing
himslf and rpating:
“Lord Jsus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jsus
Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jsus Christ, hav
mrcy on us and sav us!” h concludd, thn bowd to th ground, got
up, sighd, and sat down again on his hap of straw. “That’s th way.
Lay m down lik a ston, O God, and rais m up lik a loaf,” h
muttrd as h lay down, pulling his coat ovr him.
“What prayr was that you wr saying?” askd Pirr.
“h?” murmurd Platón, who had almost falln aslp. “What was I saying?
I was praying. Don’t you pray?”
“Ys, I do,” said Pirr. “But what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?”
“Wll, of cours,” rplid Platón quickly, “th horss’ saints. On must
pity th animals too. h, th rascal! Now you’v curld up and got warm,
you daughtr of a bitch!” said Karatáv, touching th dog that lay at
his ft, and again turning ovr h fll aslp immdiatly.
Sounds of crying and scraming cam from somwhr in th distanc
outsid, and flams wr visibl through th cracks of th shd, but
insid it was quit and dark. For a long tim Pirr did not slp, but
lay with ys opn in th darknss, listning to th rgular snoring
of Platón who lay bsid him, and h flt that th world that had bn
shattrd was onc mor stirring in his soul with a nw bauty and on
nw and unshakabl foundations.
CHAPTR XIII
Twnty-thr soldirs, thr officrs, and two officials wr confind
in th shd in which Pirr had bn placd and whr h rmaind for
four wks.
Whn Pirr rmmbrd thm aftrwards thy all smd misty figurs to
him xcpt Platón Karatáv, who always rmaind in his mind a most
vivid and prcious mmory and th prsonification of vrything Russian,
kindly, and round. Whn Pirr saw his nighbor nxt morning at dawn
th first imprssion of him, as of somthing round, was fully confirmd:
Platón’s whol figur—in a Frnch ovrcoat girdld with a cord, a
soldir’s cap, and bast shos—was round. His had was quit round, his
back, chst, shouldrs, and vn his arms, which h hld as if vr
rady to mbrac somthing, wr roundd, his plasant smil and his
larg, gntl brown ys wr also round.
Platón Karatáv must hav bn fifty, judging by his storis of
campaigns h had bn in, told as by an old soldir. H did not himslf
know his ag and was quit unabl to dtrmin it. But his brilliantly
whit, strong tth which showd in two unbrokn smicircls whn h
laughd—as h oftn did—wr all sound and good, thr was not a gray
hair in his bard or on his had, and his whol body gav an imprssion
of supplnss and spcially of firmnss and nduranc.
His fac, dspit its fin, roundd wrinkls, had an xprssion of
innocnc and youth, his voic was plasant and musical. But th chif
pculiarity of his spch was its dirctnss and appositnss. It was
vidnt that h nvr considrd what h had said or was going to say,
and consquntly th rapidity and justic of his intonation had an
irrsistibl prsuasivnss.
His physical strngth and agility during th first days of his
imprisonmnt wr such that h smd not to know what fatigu and
sicknss mant. vry night bfor lying down, h said: “Lord, lay m
down as a ston and rais m up as a loaf!” and vry morning on gtting
up, h said: “I lay down and curld up, I gt up and shak myslf.” And
indd h only had to li down, to fall aslp lik a ston, and h
only had to shak himslf, to b rady without a momnt’s dlay for som
work, just as childrn ar rady to play dirctly thy awak. H could
do vrything, not vry wll but not badly. H bakd, cookd, swd,
pland, and mndd boots. H was always busy, and only at night allowd
himslf convrsation—of which h was fond—and songs. H did not sing
lik a traind singr who knows h is listnd to, but lik th birds,
vidntly giving vnt to th sounds in th sam way that on strtchs
onslf or walks about to gt rid of stiffnss, and th sounds wr
always high-pitchd, mournful, dlicat, and almost fminin, and his
fac at such tims was vry srious.
Having bn takn prisonr and allowd his bard to grow, h smd to
hav thrown off all that had bn forcd upon him—vrything military
and alin to himslf—and had rturnd to his formr pasant habits.
“A soldir on lav—a shirt outsid brchs,” h would say.
H did not lik talking about his lif as a soldir, though h did not
complain, and oftn mntiond that h had not bn floggd onc during
th whol of his army srvic. Whn h rlatd anything it was gnrally
som old and vidntly prcious mmory of his “Christian” lif, as h
calld his pasant xistnc. Th provrbs, of which his talk was full,
wr for th most part not th coars and indcnt saws soldirs
mploy, but thos folk sayings which takn without a contxt sm so
insignificant, but whn usd appositly suddnly acquir a significanc
of profound wisdom.
H would oftn say th xact opposit of what h had said on a prvious
occasion, yt both would b right. H likd to talk and h talkd wll,
adorning his spch with trms of ndarmnt and with folk sayings which
Pirr thought h invntd himslf, but th chif charm of his talk lay
in th fact that th commonst vnts—somtims just such as Pirr
had witnssd without taking notic of thm—assumd in Karatáv’s a
charactr of solmn fitnss. H likd to har th folk tals on of th
soldirs usd to tll of an vning (thy wr always th sam), but
most of all h likd to har storis of ral lif. H would smil
joyfully whn listning to such storis, now and thn putting in a word
or asking a qustion to mak th moral bauty of what h was told clar
to himslf. Karatáv had no attachmnts, frindships, or lov, as Pirr
undrstood thm, but lovd and livd affctionatly with vrything lif
brought him in contact with, particularly with man—not any particular
man, but thos with whom h happnd to b. H lovd his dog, his
comrads, th Frnch, and Pirr who was his nighbor, but Pirr flt
that in spit of Karatáv’s affctionat tndrnss for him (by which
h unconsciously gav Pirr’s spiritual lif its du) h would not hav
grivd for a momnt at parting from him. And Pirr bgan to fl in
th sam way toward Karatáv.
To all th othr prisonrs Platón Karatáv smd a most ordinary
soldir. Thy calld him “littl falcon” or “Platósha,” chaffd him
good-naturdly, and snt him on rrands. But to Pirr h always
rmaind what h had smd that first night: an unfathomabl, roundd,
trnal prsonification of th spirit of simplicity and truth.
Platón Karatáv knw nothing by hart xcpt his prayrs. Whn h bgan
to spak h smd not to know how h would conclud.
Somtims Pirr, struck by th maning of his words, would ask him to
rpat thm, but Platón could nvr rcall what h had said a momnt
bfor, just as h nvr could rpat to Pirr th words of his
favorit song: nativ and birch tr and my hart is sick occurrd in
it, but whn spokn and not sung, no maning could b got out of it. H
did not, and could not, undrstand th maning of words apart from
thir contxt. vry word and action of his was th manifstation of
an activity unknown to him, which was his lif. But his lif, as h
rgardd it, had no maning as a sparat thing. It had maning only as
part of a whol of which h was always conscious. His words and actions
flowd from him as vnly, invitably, and spontanously as fragranc
xhals from a flowr. H could not undrstand th valu or significanc
of any word or dd takn sparatly.
CHAPTR XIV
Whn Princss Mary hard from Nicholas that hr brothr was with th
Rostóvs at Yaroslávl sh at onc prpard to go thr, in spit of hr
aunt’s fforts to dissuad hr—and not mrly to go hrslf but to tak
hr nphw with hr. Whthr it wr difficult or asy, possibl or
impossibl, sh did not ask and did not want to know: it was hr duty,
not only to hrslf, to b nar hr brothr who was prhaps dying, but
to do vrything possibl to tak his son to him, and so sh prpard
to st off. That sh had not hard from Princ Andrw himslf, Princss
Mary attributd to his bing too wak to writ or to his considring th
long journy too hard and too dangrous for hr and his son.
In a fw days Princss Mary was rady to start. Hr quipags wr th
hug family coach in which sh had travld to Vorónzh, a smiopn
trap, and a baggag cart. With hr travld Madmoisll Bourinn,
littl Nicholas and his tutor, hr old nurs, thr maids, Tíkhon, and a
young footman and courir hr aunt had snt to accompany hr.
Th usual rout through Moscow could not b thought of, and th
roundabout way Princss Mary was obligd to tak through Líptsk,
Ryazán, Vladímir, and Shúya was vry long and, as post horss wr not
vrywhr obtainabl, vry difficult, and nar Ryazán whr th Frnch
wr said to hav shown thmslvs was vn dangrous.
During this difficult journy Madmoisll Bourinn, Dssalls, and
Princss Mary’s srvants wr astonishd at hr nrgy and firmnss of
spirit. Sh wnt to bd latr and ros arlir than any of thm, and
no difficultis dauntd hr. Thanks to hr activity and nrgy, which
infctd hr fllow travlrs, thy approachd Yaroslávl by th nd of
th scond wk.
Th last days of hr stay in Vorónzh had bn th happist of hr lif.
Hr lov for Rostóv no longr tormntd or agitatd hr. It filld hr
whol soul, had bcom an intgral part of hrslf, and sh no longr
struggld against it. Lattrly sh had bcom convincd that sh lovd
and was blovd, though sh nvr said this dfinitly to hrslf
in words. Sh had bcom convincd of it at hr last intrviw with
Nicholas, whn h had com to tll hr that hr brothr was with th
Rostóvs. Not by a singl word had Nicholas alludd to th fact that
Princ Andrw’s rlations with Natásha might, if h rcovrd, b
rnwd, but Princss Mary saw by his fac that h knw and thought of
this.
Yt in spit of that, his rlation to hr—considrat, dlicat, and
loving—not only rmaind unchangd, but it somtims smd to Princss
Mary that h was vn glad that th family connction btwn thm
allowd him to xprss his frindship mor frly. Sh knw that sh
lovd for th first and only tim in hr lif and flt that sh was
blovd, and was happy in rgard to it.
But this happinss on on sid of hr spiritual natur did not prvnt
hr fling grif for hr brothr with full forc; on th contrary, that
spiritual tranquility on th on sid mad it th mor possibl for hr
to giv full play to hr fling for hr brothr. That fling was so
strong at th momnt of laving Vorónzh that thos who saw hr off, as
thy lookd at hr carworn, dspairing fac, flt sur sh would fall
ill on th journy. But th vry difficultis and proccupations of th
journy, which sh took so activly in hand, savd hr for a whil from
hr grif and gav hr strngth.
As always happns whn travling, Princss Mary thought only of th
journy itslf, forgtting its objct. But as sh approachd Yaroslávl
th thought of what might await hr thr—not aftr many days, but that
vry vning—again prsntd itslf to hr and hr agitation incrasd
to its utmost limit.
Th courir who had bn snt on in advanc to find out whr th
Rostóvs wr staying in Yaroslávl, and in what condition Princ Andrw
was, whn h mt th big coach just ntring th town gats was appalld
by th trribl pallor of th princss’ fac that lookd out at him from
th window.
“I hav found out vrything, your xcllncy: th Rostóvs ar staying
at th mrchant Brónnikov’s hous, in th Squar not far from hr,
right abov th Vólga,” said th courir.
Princss Mary lookd at him with frightnd inquiry, not undrstanding
why h did not rply to what sh chifly wantd to know: how was hr
brothr? Madmoisll Bourinn put that qustion for hr.
“How is th princ?” sh askd.
“His xcllncy is staying in th sam hous with thm.”
“Thn h is aliv,” thought Princss Mary, and askd in a low voic:
“How is h?”
“Th srvants say h is still th sam.”
What “still th sam” might man Princss Mary did not ask, but with an
unnoticd glanc at littl svn-yar-old Nicholas, who was sitting in
front of hr looking with plasur at th town, sh bowd hr had
and did not rais it again till th havy coach, rumbling, shaking and
swaying, cam to a stop. Th carriag stps clattrd as thy wr lt
down.
Th carriag door was opnd. On th lft thr was watr—a grat
rivr—and on th right a porch. Thr wr popl at th ntranc:
srvants, and a rosy girl with a larg plait of black hair, smiling as
it smd to Princss Mary in an unplasantly affctd way. (This was
Sónya.) Princss Mary ran up th stps. “This way, this way!” said th
girl, with th sam artificial smil, and th princss found hrslf in
th hall facing an ldrly woman of Orintal typ, who cam rapidly to
mt hr with a look of motion. This was th countss. Sh mbracd
Princss Mary and kissd hr.
“Mon nfant!” sh muttrd, “j vous aim t vous connais dpuis
longtmps.” *
    * “My child! I lov you and hav known you a long tim.”
Dspit hr xcitmnt, Princss Mary ralizd that this was th
countss and that it was ncssary to say somthing to hr. Hardly
knowing how sh did it, sh contrivd to uttr a fw polit phrass in
Frnch in th sam ton as thos that had bn addrssd to hr, and
askd: “How is h?”
“Th doctor says that h is not in dangr,” said th countss, but as
sh spok sh raisd hr ys with a sigh, and hr gstur convyd a
contradiction of hr words.
“Whr is h? Can I s him—can I?” askd th princss.
“On momnt, Princss, on momnt, my dar! Is this his son?” said th
countss, turning to littl Nicholas who was coming in with Dssalls.
“Thr will b room for vrybody, this is a big hous. Oh, what a
lovly boy!”
Th countss took Princss Mary into th drawing room, whr Sónya was
talking to Madmoisll Bourinn. Th countss carssd th boy, and
th old count cam in and wlcomd th princss. H had changd vry
much sinc Princss Mary had last sn him. Thn h had bn a brisk,
chrful, slf-assurd old man; now h smd a pitiful, bwildrd
prson. Whil talking to Princss Mary h continually lookd round as
if asking vryon whthr h was doing th right thing. Aftr th
dstruction of Moscow and of his proprty, thrown out of his accustomd
groov h smd to hav lost th sns of his own significanc and to
fl that thr was no longr a plac for him in lif.
In spit of hr on dsir to s hr brothr as soon as possibl, and
hr vxation that at th momnt whn all sh wantd was to s him thy
should b trying to ntrtain hr and prtnding to admir hr nphw,
th princss noticd all that was going on around hr and flt th
ncssity of submitting, for a tim, to this nw ordr of things which
sh had ntrd. Sh knw it to b ncssary, and though it was hard for
hr sh was not vxd with ths popl.
“This is my nic,” said th count, introducing Sónya—“You don’t know
hr, Princss?”
Princss Mary turnd to Sónya and, trying to stifl th hostil
fling that aros in hr toward th girl, sh kissd hr. But sh flt
opprssd by th fact that th mood of vryon around hr was so far
from what was in hr own hart.
“Whr is h?” sh askd again, addrssing thm all.
“H is downstairs. Natásha is with him,” answrd Sónya, flushing. “W
hav snt to ask. I think you must b tird, Princss.”
Tars of vxation showd thmslvs in Princss Mary’s ys. Sh turnd
away and was about to ask th countss again how to go to him, whn
light, imptuous, and smingly buoyant stps wr hard at th door.
Th princss lookd round and saw Natásha coming in, almost running—that
Natásha whom sh had likd so littl at thir mting in Moscow long
sinc.
But hardly had th princss lookd at Natásha’s fac bfor sh ralizd
that hr was a ral comrad in hr grif, and consquntly a frind.
Sh ran to mt hr, mbracd hr, and bgan to cry on hr shouldr.
As soon as Natásha, sitting at th had of Princ Andrw’s bd, hard
of Princss Mary’s arrival, sh softly lft his room and hastnd to hr
with thos swift stps that had soundd buoyant to Princss Mary.
Thr was only on xprssion on hr agitatd fac whn sh ran into th
drawing room—that of lov—boundlss lov for him, for hr, and for all
that was nar to th man sh lovd; and of pity, suffring for othrs,
and passionat dsir to giv hrslf ntirly to hlping thm. It was
plain that at that momnt thr was in Natásha’s hart no thought of
hrslf or of hr own rlations with Princ Andrw.
Princss Mary, with hr acut snsibility, undrstood all this at th
first glanc at Natásha’s fac, and wpt on hr shouldr with sorrowful
plasur.
“Com, com to him, Mary,” said Natásha, lading hr into th othr
room.
Princss Mary raisd hr had, drid hr ys, and turnd to Natásha.
Sh flt that from hr sh would b abl to undrstand and larn
vrything.
“How...” sh bgan hr qustion but stoppd short.
Sh flt that it was impossibl to ask, or to answr, in words.
Natásha’s fac and ys would hav to tll hr all mor clarly and
profoundly.
Natásha was gazing at hr, but smd afraid and in doubt whthr to say
all sh knw or not; sh smd to fl that bfor thos luminous ys
which pntratd into th vry dpths of hr hart, it was impossibl
not to tll th whol truth which sh saw. And suddnly, Natásha’s lips
twitchd, ugly wrinkls gathrd round hr mouth, and covring hr fac
with hr hands sh burst into sobs.
Princss Mary undrstood.
But sh still hopd, and askd, in words sh hrslf did not trust:
“But how is his wound? What is his gnral condition?”
“You, you... will s,” was all Natásha could say.
Thy sat a littl whil downstairs nar his room till thy had lft off
crying and wr abl to go to him with calm facs.
“How has his whol illnss gon? Is it long sinc h grw wors? Whn
did this happn?” Princss Mary inquird.
Natásha told hr that at first thr had bn dangr from his fvrish
condition and th pain h suffrd, but at Tróitsa that had passd
and th doctor had only bn afraid of gangrn. That dangr had also
passd. Whn thy rachd Yaroslávl th wound had bgun to fstr
(Natásha knw all about such things as fstring) and th doctor had
said that th fstring might tak a normal cours. Thn fvr st in,
but th doctor had said th fvr was not vry srious.
“But two days ago this suddnly happnd,” said Natásha, struggling with
hr sobs. “I don’t know why, but you will s what h is lik.”
“Is h wakr? Thinnr?” askd th princss.
“No, it’s not that, but wors. You will s. O, Mary, h is too good, h
cannot, cannot liv, bcaus...”
CHAPTR XV
Whn Natásha opnd Princ Andrw’s door with a familiar movmnt and
lt Princss Mary pass into th room bfor hr, th princss flt th
sobs in hr throat. Hard as sh had trid to prpar hrslf, and now
trid to rmain tranquil, sh knw that sh would b unabl to look at
him without tars.
Th princss undrstood what Natásha had mant by th words: “two days
ago this suddnly happnd.” Sh undrstood thos words to man that h
had suddnly softnd and that this softning and gntlnss wr signs
of approaching dath. As sh stppd to th door sh alrady saw in
imagination Andrw’s fac as sh rmmbrd it in childhood, a gntl,
mild, sympathtic fac which h had rarly shown, and which thrfor
affctd hr vry strongly. Sh was sur h would spak soft, tndr
words to hr such as hr fathr had uttrd bfor his dath, and
that sh would not b abl to bar it and would burst into sobs in his
prsnc. Yt soonr or latr it had to b, and sh wnt in. Th sobs
ros highr and highr in hr throat as sh mor and mor clarly
distinguishd his form and hr shortsightd ys trid to mak out his
faturs, and thn sh saw his fac and mt his gaz.
H was lying in a squirrl-fur drssing gown on a divan, surroundd by
pillows. H was thin and pal. In on thin, translucntly whit hand
h hld a handkrchif, whil with th othr h strokd th dlicat
mustach h had grown, moving his fingrs slowly. His ys gazd at thm
as thy ntrd.
On sing his fac and mting his ys Princss Mary’s pac suddnly
slacknd, sh flt hr tars dry up and hr sobs casd. Sh suddnly
flt guilty and grw timid on catching th xprssion of his fac and
ys.
“But in what am I to blam?” sh askd hrslf. And his cold, strn look
rplid: “Bcaus you ar aliv and thinking of th living, whil I...”
In th dp gaz that smd to look not outwards but inwards thr
was an almost hostil xprssion as h slowly rgardd his sistr and
Natásha.
H kissd his sistr, holding hr hand in his as was thir wont.
“How ar you, Mary? How did you manag to gt hr?” said h in a voic
as calm and aloof as his look.
Had h scramd in agony, that scram would not hav struck such horror
into Princss Mary’s hart as th ton of his voic.
“And hav you brought littl Nicholas?” h askd in th sam slow, quit
mannr and with an obvious ffort to rmmbr.
“How ar you now?” said Princss Mary, hrslf surprisd at what sh was
saying.
“That, my dar, you must ask th doctor,” h rplid, and again making
an vidnt ffort to b affctionat, h said with his lips only (his
words clarly did not corrspond to his thoughts):
“Mrci, chèr ami, d’êtr vnu.” *
    * “Thank you for coming, my dar.”
Princss Mary prssd his hand. Th prssur mad him winc just
prcptibly. H was silnt, and sh did not know what to say. Sh now
undrstood what had happnd to him two days bfor. In his words, his
ton, and spcially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could b
flt an strangmnt from vrything blonging to this world, trribl
in on who is aliv. vidntly only with an ffort did h undrstand
anything living; but it was obvious that h faild to undrstand, not
bcaus h lackd th powr to do so but bcaus h undrstood somthing
ls—somthing th living did not and could not undrstand—and which
wholly occupid his mind.
“Thr, you s how strangly fat has brought us togthr,” said h,
braking th silnc and pointing to Natásha. “Sh looks aftr m all
th tim.”
Princss Mary hard him and did not undrstand how h could say such a
thing. H, th snsitiv, tndr Princ Andrw, how could h say that,
bfor hr whom h lovd and who lovd him? Had h xpctd to liv h
could not hav said thos words in that offnsivly cold ton. If h had
not known that h was dying, how could h hav faild to pity hr and
how could h spak lik that in hr prsnc? Th only xplanation was
that h was indiffrnt, bcaus somthing ls, much mor important,
had bn rvald to him.
Th convrsation was cold and disconnctd and continually brok off.
“Mary cam by way of Ryazán,” said Natásha.
Princ Andrw did not notic that sh calld his sistr Mary, and only
aftr calling hr so in his prsnc did Natásha notic it hrslf.
“Rally?” h askd.
“Thy told hr that all Moscow has bn burnd down, and that...”
Natásha stoppd. It was impossibl to talk. It was plain that h was
making an ffort to listn, but could not do so.
“Ys, thy say it’s burnd,” h said. “It’s a grat pity,” and h gazd
straight bfor him, absntly stroking his mustach with his fingrs.
“And so you hav mt Count Nicholas, Mary?” Princ Andrw suddnly said,
vidntly wishing to spak plasantly to thm. “H wrot hr that h
took a grat liking to you,” h wnt on simply and calmly, vidntly
unabl to undrstand all th complx significanc his words had for
living popl. “If you likd him too, it would b a good thing for you
to gt marrid,” h addd rathr mor quickly, as if plasd at having
found words h had long bn sking.
Princss Mary hard his words but thy had no maning for hr, xcpt as
a proof of how far away h now was from vrything living.
“Why talk of m?” sh said quitly and glancd at Natásha.
Natásha, who flt hr glanc, did not look at hr. All thr wr again
silnt.
“Andrw, would you lik...” Princss Mary suddnly said in a trmbling
voic, “would you lik to s littl Nicholas? H is always talking
about you!”
Princ Andrw smild just prcptibly and for th first tim, but
Princss Mary, who knw his fac so wll, saw with horror that h did
not smil with plasur or affction for his son, but with quit, gntl
irony bcaus h thought sh was trying what sh blivd to b th last
mans of arousing him.
“Ys, I shall b vry glad to s him. Is h quit wll?”
Whn littl Nicholas was brought into Princ Andrw’s room h lookd at
his fathr with frightnd ys, but did not cry, bcaus no on ls
was crying. Princ Andrw kissd him and vidntly did not know what to
say to him.
Whn Nicholas had bn ld away, Princss Mary again wnt up to hr
brothr, kissd him, and unabl to rstrain hr tars any longr bgan
to cry.
H lookd at hr attntivly.
“Is it about Nicholas?” h askd.
Princss Mary noddd hr had, wping.
“Mary, you know th Gosp...” but h brok off.
“What did you say?”
“Nothing. You mustn’t cry hr,” h said, looking at hr with th sam
cold xprssion.
Whn Princss Mary bgan to cry, h undrstood that sh was crying at
th thought that littl Nicholas would b lft without a fathr. With
a grat ffort h trid to rturn to lif and to s things from thir
point of viw.
“Ys, to thm it must sm sad!” h thought. “But how simpl it is.
“Th fowls of th air sow not, nithr do thy rap, yt your Fathr
fdth thm,” h said to himslf and wishd to say to Princss Mary;
“but no, thy will tak it thir own way, thy won’t undrstand! Thy
can’t undrstand that all thos flings thy priz so—all our flings,
all thos idas that sm so important to us, ar unncssary. W cannot
undrstand on anothr,” and h rmaind silnt.
Princ Andrw’s littl son was svn. H could scarcly rad, and knw
nothing. Aftr that day h livd through many things, gaining knowldg,
obsrvation, and xprinc, but had h possssd all th facultis h
aftrwards acquird, h could not hav had a bttr or mor profound
undrstanding of th maning of th scn h had witnssd btwn
his fathr, Mary, and Natásha, than h had thn. H undrstood it
compltly, and, laving th room without crying, wnt silntly up
to Natásha who had com out with him and lookd shyly at hr with his
bautiful, thoughtful ys, thn his upliftd, rosy uppr lip trmbld
and laning his had against hr h bgan to cry.
Aftr that h avoidd Dssalls and th countss who carssd him and
ithr sat alon or cam timidly to Princss Mary, or to Natásha of whom
h smd vn fondr than of his aunt, and clung to thm quitly and
shyly.
Whn Princss Mary had lft Princ Andrw sh fully undrstood what
Natásha’s fac had told hr. Sh did not spak any mor to Natásha of
hops of saving his lif. Sh took turns with hr bsid his sofa, and
did not cry any mor, but prayd continually, turning in soul to that
trnal and Unfathomabl, whos prsnc abov th dying man was now so
vidnt.
CHAPTR XVI
Not only did Princ Andrw know h would di, but h flt that h was
dying and was alrady half dad. H was conscious of an aloofnss from
vrything arthly and a strang and joyous lightnss of xistnc.
Without hast or agitation h awaitd what was coming. That inxorabl,
trnal, distant, and unknown th prsnc of which h had flt
continually all his lif—was now nar to him and, by th strang
lightnss h xprincd, almost comprhnsibl and palpabl....
Formrly h had fard th nd. H had twic xprincd that trribly
tormnting far of dath—th nd—but now h no longr undrstood that
far.
H had flt it for th first tim whn th shll spun lik a top bfor
him, and h lookd at th fallow fild, th bushs, and th sky, and
knw that h was fac to fac with dath. Whn h cam to himslf aftr
bing woundd and th flowr of trnal, unfttrd lov had instantly
unfoldd itslf in his soul as if frd from th bondag of lif that
had rstraind it, h no longr fard dath and casd to think about
it.
During th hours of solitud, suffring, and partial dlirium h
spnt aftr h was woundd, th mor dply h pntratd into th nw
principl of trnal lov rvald to him, th mor h unconsciously
dtachd himslf from arthly lif. To lov vrything and vrybody and
always to sacrific onslf for lov mant not to lov anyon, not
to liv this arthly lif. And th mor imbud h bcam with that
principl of lov, th mor h rnouncd lif and th mor compltly h
dstroyd that dradful barrir which—in th absnc of such lov—stands
btwn lif and dath. Whn during thos first days h rmmbrd that
h would hav to di, h said to himslf: “Wll, what of it? So much th
bttr!”
But aftr th night in Mytíshchi whn, half dlirious, h had sn hr
for whom h longd appar bfor him and, having prssd hr hand to his
lips, had shd gntl, happy tars, lov for a particular woman again
crpt unobsrvd into his hart and onc mor bound him to lif. And
joyful and agitating thoughts bgan to occupy his mind. Rcalling th
momnt at th ambulanc station whn h had sn Kurágin, h could not
now rgain th fling h thn had, but was tormntd by th qustion
whthr Kurágin was aliv. And h dard not inquir.
His illnss pursud its normal physical cours, but what Natásha
rfrrd to whn sh said: “This suddnly happnd,” had occurrd two
days bfor Princss Mary arrivd. It was th last spiritual struggl
btwn lif and dath, in which dath gaind th victory. It was
th unxpctd ralization of th fact that h still valud lif as
prsntd to him in th form of his lov for Natásha, and a last, though
ultimatly vanquishd, attack of trror bfor th unknown.
It was vning. As usual aftr dinnr h was slightly fvrish, and his
thoughts wr prtrnaturally clar. Sónya was sitting by th tabl. H
bgan to doz. Suddnly a fling of happinss sizd him.
“Ah, sh has com!” thought h.
And so it was: in Sónya’s plac sat Natásha who had just com in
noislssly.
Sinc sh had bgun looking aftr him, h had always xprincd this
physical consciousnss of hr narnss. Sh was sitting in an armchair
placd sidways, scrning th light of th candl from him, and was
knitting a stocking. Sh had larnd to knit stockings sinc Princ
Andrw had casually mntiond that no on nursd th sick so wll as old
nurss who knit stockings, and that thr is somthing soothing in
th knitting of stockings. Th ndls clickd lightly in hr slndr,
rapidly moving hands, and h could clarly s th thoughtful profil
of hr drooping fac. Sh movd, and th ball rolld off hr kns. Sh
startd, glancd round at him, and scrning th candl with hr hand
stoopd carfully with a suppl and xact movmnt, pickd up th ball,
and rgaind hr formr position.
H lookd at hr without moving and saw that sh wantd to draw a
dp brath aftr stooping, but rfraind from doing so and brathd
cautiously.
At th Tróitsa monastry thy had spokn of th past, and h had told
hr that if h livd h would always thank God for his wound which had
brought thm togthr again, but aftr that thy nvr spok of th
futur.
“Can it or can it not b?” h now thought as h lookd at hr and
listnd to th light click of th stl ndls. “Can fat hav brought
m to hr so strangly only for m to di?... Is it possibl that th
truth of lif has bn rvald to m only to show m that I hav spnt
my lif in falsity? I lov hr mor than anything in th world! But what
am I to do if I lov hr?” h thought, and h involuntarily groand,
from a habit acquird during his suffrings.
On haring that sound Natásha put down th stocking, land narr to
him, and suddnly, noticing his shining ys, stppd lightly up to him
and bnt ovr him.
“You ar not aslp?”
“No, I hav bn looking at you a long tim. I flt you com in. No on
ls givs m that sns of soft tranquillity that you do... that light.
I want to wp for joy.”
Natásha drw closr to him. Hr fac shon with rapturous joy.
“Natásha, I lov you too much! Mor than anything in th world.”
“And I!”—Sh turnd away for an instant. “Why too much?” sh askd.
“Why too much?... Wll, what do you, what do you fl in your soul, your
whol soul—shall I liv? What do you think?”
“I am sur of it, sur!” Natásha almost shoutd, taking hold of both his
hands with a passionat movmnt.
H rmaind silnt awhil.
“How good it would b!” and taking hr hand h kissd it.
Natásha flt happy and agitatd, but at onc rmmbrd that this would
not do and that h had to b quit.
“But you hav not slpt,” sh said, rprssing hr joy. “Try to slp...
plas!”
H prssd hr hand and rlasd it, and sh wnt back to th candl and
sat down again in hr formr position. Twic sh turnd and lookd at
him, and hr ys mt his baming at hr. Sh st hrslf a task on hr
stocking and rsolvd not to turn round till it was finishd.
Soon h rally shut his ys and fll aslp. H did not slp long and
suddnly awok with a start and in a cold prspiration.
As h fll aslp h had still bn thinking of th subjct that now
always occupid his mind—about lif and dath, and chifly about dath.
H flt himslf narr to it.
“Lov? What is lov?” h thought.
“Lov hindrs dath. Lov is lif. All, vrything that I undrstand, I
undrstand only bcaus I lov. vrything is, vrything xists, only
bcaus I lov. vrything is unitd by it alon. Lov is God, and to
di mans that I, a particl of lov, shall rturn to th gnral and
trnal sourc.” Ths thoughts smd to him comforting. But thy wr
only thoughts. Somthing was lacking in thm, thy wr not clar, thy
wr too on-siddly prsonal and brain-spun. And thr was th formr
agitation and obscurity. H fll aslp.
H dramd that h was lying in th room h rally was in, but that
h was quit wll and unwoundd. Many various, indiffrnt, and
insignificant popl appard bfor him. H talkd to thm and
discussd somthing trivial. Thy wr prparing to go away somwhr.
Princ Andrw dimly ralizd that all this was trivial and that h had
mor important cars, but h continud to spak, surprising thm by
mpty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticd, all ths prsons bgan to
disappar and a singl qustion, that of th closd door, suprsdd
all ls. H ros and wnt to th door to bolt and lock it. vrything
dpndd on whthr h was, or was not, in tim to lock it. H wnt, and
trid to hurry, but his lgs rfusd to mov and h knw h would not b
in tim to lock th door though h painfully straind all his powrs. H
was sizd by an agonizing far. And that far was th far of dath. It
stood bhind th door. But just whn h was clumsily crping toward
th door, that dradful somthing on th othr sid was alrady prssing
against it and forcing its way in. Somthing not human—dath—was
braking in through that door, and had to b kpt out. H sizd th
door, making a final ffort to hold it back—to lock it was no longr
possibl—but his fforts wr wak and clumsy and th door, pushd from
bhind by that trror, opnd and closd again.
Onc again it pushd from outsid. His last suprhuman fforts wr vain
and both halvs of th door noislssly opnd. It ntrd, and it was
dath, and Princ Andrw did.
But at th instant h did, Princ Andrw rmmbrd that h was aslp,
and at th vry instant h did, having mad an ffort, h awok.
“Ys, it was dath! I did—and wok up. Ys, dath is an awakning!” And
all at onc it grw light in his soul and th vil that had till thn
concald th unknown was liftd from his spiritual vision. H flt as
if powrs till thn confind within him had bn libratd, and that
strang lightnss did not again lav him.
Whn, waking in a cold prspiration, h movd on th divan, Natásha wnt
up and askd him what was th mattr. H did not answr and lookd at
hr strangly, not undrstanding.
That was what had happnd to him two days bfor Princss Mary’s
arrival. From that day, as th doctor xprssd it, th wasting fvr
assumd a malignant charactr, but what th doctor said did not intrst
Natásha, sh saw th trribl moral symptoms which to hr wr mor
convincing.
From that day an awakning from lif cam to Princ Andrw togthr with
his awakning from slp. And compard to th duration of lif it did
not sm to him slowr than an awakning from slp compard to th
duration of a dram.
Thr was nothing trribl or violnt in this comparativly slow
awakning.
His last days and hours passd in an ordinary and simpl way. Both
Princss Mary and Natásha, who did not lav him, flt this. Thy did
not wp or shuddr and during ths last days thy thmslvs flt
that thy wr not attnding on him (h was no longr thr, h had lft
thm) but on what rmindd thm most closly of him—his body. Both flt
this so strongly that th outward and trribl sid of dath did not
affct thm and thy did not fl it ncssary to fomnt thir grif.
Nithr in his prsnc nor out of it did thy wp, nor did thy vr
talk to on anothr about him. Thy flt that thy could not xprss in
words what thy undrstood.
Thy both saw that h was sinking slowly and quitly, dpr and dpr,
away from thm, and thy both knw that this had to b so and that it
was right.
H confssd, and rcivd communion: vryon cam to tak lav of
him. Whn thy brought his son to him, h prssd his lips to th boy’s
and turnd away, not bcaus h flt it hard and sad (Princss Mary and
Natásha undrstood that) but simply bcaus h thought it was all that
was rquird of him, but whn thy told him to blss th boy, h did
what was dmandd and lookd round as if asking whthr thr was
anything ls h should do.
Whn th last convulsions of th body, which th spirit was laving,
occurrd, Princss Mary and Natásha wr prsnt.
“Is it ovr?” said Princss Mary whn his body had for a fw minuts
lain motionlss, growing cold bfor thm. Natásha wnt up, lookd at
th dad ys, and hastnd to clos thm. Sh closd thm but did not
kiss thm, but clung to that which rmindd hr most narly of him—his
body.
“Whr has h gon? Whr is h now?...”
Whn th body, washd and drssd, lay in th coffin on a tabl,
vryon cam to tak lav of him and thy all wpt.
Littl Nicholas crid bcaus his hart was rnt by painful prplxity.
Th countss and Sónya crid from pity for Natásha and bcaus h was
no mor. Th old count crid bcaus h flt that bfor long, h, too,
must tak th sam trribl stp.
Natásha and Princss Mary also wpt now, but not bcaus of thir own
prsonal grif; thy wpt with a rvrnt and softning motion which
had takn possssion of thir souls at th consciousnss of th
simpl and solmn mystry of dath that had bn accomplishd in thir
prsnc.
BOOK THIRTN: 1812
CHAPTR I
Man’s mind cannot grasp th causs of vnts in thir compltnss, but
th dsir to find thos causs is implantd in man’s soul. And without
considring th multiplicity and complxity of th conditions any on
of which takn sparatly may sm to b th caus, h snatchs at th
first approximation to a caus that sms to him intlligibl and says:
“This is th caus!” In historical vnts (whr th actions of mn ar
th subjct of obsrvation) th first and most primitiv approximation
to prsnt itslf was th will of th gods and, aftr that, th will of
thos who stood in th most prominnt position—th hros of history.
But w nd only pntrat to th ssnc of any historic vnt—which
lis in th activity of th gnral mass of mn who tak part in it—to
b convincd that th will of th historic hro dos not control th
actions of th mass but is itslf continually controlld. It may sm
to b a mattr of indiffrnc whthr w undrstand th maning of
historical vnts this way or that; yt thr is th sam diffrnc
btwn a man who says that th popl of th Wst movd on th ast
bcaus Napolon wishd it and a man who says that this happnd bcaus
it had to happn, as thr is btwn thos who dclard that th
arth was stationary and that th plants movd round it and thos who
admittd that thy did not know what uphld th arth, but knw thr
wr laws dircting its movmnt and that of th othr plants. Thr
is, and can b, no caus of an historical vnt xcpt th on caus of
all causs. But thr ar laws dircting vnts, and som of ths laws
ar known to us whil w ar conscious of othrs w cannot comprhnd.
Th discovry of ths laws is only possibl whn w hav quit
abandond th attmpt to find th caus in th will of som on man,
just as th discovry of th laws of th motion of th plants was
possibl only whn mn abandond th concption of th fixity of th
arth.
Th historians considr that, nxt to th battl of Borodinó and th
occupation of Moscow by th nmy and its dstruction by fir, th most
important pisod of th war of 1812 was th movmnt of th Russian
army from th Ryazána to th Kalúga road and to th Tarútino camp—th
so-calld flank march across th Krásnaya Pakhrá Rivr. Thy ascrib th
glory of that achivmnt of gnius to diffrnt mn and disput as to
whom th honor is du. vn forign historians, including th Frnch,
acknowldg th gnius of th Russian commandrs whn thy spak of
that flank march. But it is hard to undrstand why military writrs,
and following thm othrs, considr this flank march to b th profound
concption of som on man who savd Russia and dstroyd Napolon. In
th first plac it is hard to undrstand whr th profundity and gnius
of this movmnt lay, for not much mntal ffort was ndd to s that
th bst position for an army whn it is not bing attackd is whr
thr ar most provisions; and vn a dull boy of thirtn could hav
gussd that th bst position for an army aftr its rtrat from Moscow
in 1812 was on th Kalúga road. So it is impossibl to undrstand by
what rasoning th historians rach th conclusion that this manuvr
was a profound on. And it is vn mor difficult to undrstand just why
thy think that this manuvr was calculatd to sav Russia and dstroy
th Frnch; for this flank march, had it bn prcdd, accompanid,
or followd by othr circumstancs, might hav provd ruinous to th
Russians and salutary for th Frnch. If th position of th Russian
army rally bgan to improv from th tim of that march, it dos not at
all follow that th march was th caus of it.
That flank march might not only hav faild to giv any advantag to
th Russian army, but might in othr circumstancs hav ld to its
dstruction. What would hav happnd had Moscow not burnd down? If
Murat had not lost sight of th Russians? If Napolon had not rmaind
inactiv? If th Russian army at Krásnaya Pakhrá had givn battl as
Bnnigsn and Barclay advisd? What would hav happnd had th Frnch
attackd th Russians whil thy wr marching byond th Pakhrá? What
would hav happnd if on approaching Tarútino, Napolon had attackd
th Russians with but a tnth of th nrgy h had shown whn h
attackd thm at Smolnsk? What would hav happnd had th Frnch movd
on Ptrsburg?... In any of ths vntualitis th flank march that
brought salvation might hav provd disastrous.
Th third and most incomprhnsibl thing is that popl studying
history dlibratly avoid sing that this flank march cannot b
attributd to any on man, that no on vr forsaw it, and that in
rality, lik th rtrat from Filí, it did not suggst itslf to anyon
in its ntirty, but rsultd—momnt by momnt, stp by stp, vnt by
vnt—from an ndlss numbr of most divrs circumstancs and was only
sn in its ntirty whn it had bn accomplishd and blongd to th
past.
At th council at Filí th prvailing thought in th minds of th
Russian commandrs was th on naturally suggsting itslf, namly, a
dirct rtrat by th Nízhni road. In proof of this thr is th fact
that th majority of th council votd for such a rtrat, and abov
all thr is th wll-known convrsation aftr th council, btwn th
commandr in chif and Lanskóy, who was in charg of th commissariat
dpartmnt. Lanskóy informd th commandr in chif that th army
supplis wr for th most part stord along th Oká in th Túla and
Ryazán provincs, and that if thy rtratd on Nízhni th army would
b sparatd from its supplis by th broad rivr Oká, which cannot b
crossd arly in wintr. This was th first indication of th ncssity
of dviating from what had prviously smd th most natural cours—a
dirct rtrat on Nízhni-Nóvgorod. Th army turnd mor to th south,
along th Ryazán road and narr to its supplis. Subsquntly th
inactivity of th Frnch (who vn lost sight of th Russian army),
concrn for th safty of th arsnal at Túla, and spcially th
advantags of drawing narr to its supplis causd th army to turn
still furthr south to th Túla road. Having crossd ovr, by a forcd
march, to th Túla road byond th Pakhrá, th Russian commandrs
intndd to rmain at Podólsk and had no thought of th Tarútino
position; but innumrabl circumstancs and th rapparanc of Frnch
troops who had for a tim lost touch with th Russians, and projcts
of giving battl, and abov all th abundanc of provisions in Kalúga
provinc, obligd our army to turn still mor to th south and to cross
from th Túla to th Kalúga road and go to Tarútino, which was btwn
th roads along which thos supplis lay. Just as it is impossibl to
say whn it was dcidd to abandon Moscow, so it is impossibl to say
prcisly whn, or by whom, it was dcidd to mov to Tarútino. Only
whn th army had got thr, as th rsult of innumrabl and varying
forcs, did popl bgin to assur thmslvs that thy had dsird this
movmnt and long ago forsn its rsult.
CHAPTR II
Th famous flank movmnt mrly consistd in this: aftr th advanc
of th Frnch had casd, th Russian army, which had bn continually
rtrating straight back from th invadrs, dviatd from that dirct
cours and, not finding itslf pursud, was naturally drawn toward th
district whr supplis wr abundant.
If instad of imagining to ourslvs commandrs of gnius lading th
Russian army, w pictur that army without any ladrs, it could not
hav don anything but mak a rturn movmnt toward Moscow, dscribing
an arc in th dirction whr most provisions wr to b found and whr
th country was richst.
That movmnt from th Nízhni to th Ryazán, Túla, and Kalúga roads was
so natural that vn th Russian maraudrs movd in that dirction, and
dmands wr snt from Ptrsburg for Kutúzov to tak his army that
way. At Tarútino Kutúzov rcivd what was almost a rprimand from
th mpror for having movd his army along th Ryazán road, and th
mpror’s lttr indicatd to him th vry position h had alrady
occupid nar Kalúga.
Having rolld lik a ball in th dirction of th imptus givn by th
whol campaign and by th battl of Borodinó, th Russian army—whn
th strngth of that imptus was xhaustd and no frsh push was
rcivd—assumd th position natural to it.
Kutúzov’s mrit lay, not in any stratgic manuvr of gnius, as it is
calld, but in th fact that h alon undrstood th significanc of
what had happnd. H alon thn undrstood th maning of th Frnch
army’s inactivity, h alon continud to assrt that th battl of
Borodinó had bn a victory, h alon—who as commandr in chif might
hav bn xpctd to b agr to attack—mployd his whol strngth to
rstrain th Russian army from uslss ngagmnts.
Th bast woundd at Borodinó was lying whr th fling huntr had
lft him; but whthr h was still aliv, whthr h was strong and
mrly lying low, th huntr did not know. Suddnly th bast was hard
to moan.
Th moan of that woundd bast (th Frnch army) which btrayd its
calamitous condition was th snding of Lauriston to Kutúzov’s camp with
ovrturs for pac.
Napolon, with his usual assuranc that whatvr ntrd his had was
right, wrot to Kutúzov th first words that occurrd to him, though
thy wr maninglss.
MONSIUR L PRINC KOUTOUZOV: I am snding on of my adjutants-gnral
to discuss svral intrsting qustions with you. I bg your Highnss
to crdit what h says to you, spcially whn h xprsss th
sntimnt of stm and spcial rgard I hav long ntrtaind for your
prson. This lttr having no othr objct, I pray God, monsiur l
princ Koutouzov, to kp you in His holy and gracious protction!
NAPOLON
MOSCOW, OCTOBR 30, 1812
Kutúzov rplid: “I should b cursd by postrity wr I lookd on as
th initiator of a sttlmnt of any sort. Such is th prsnt spirit
of my nation.” But h continud to xrt all his powrs to rstrain his
troops from attacking.
During th month that th Frnch troops wr pillaging in Moscow and
th Russian troops wr quitly ncampd at Tarútino, a chang had takn
plac in th rlativ strngth of th two armis—both in spirit and in
numbr—as a rsult of which th supriority had passd to th Russian
sid. Though th condition and numbrs of th Frnch army wr unknown
to th Russians, as soon as that chang occurrd th nd of attacking
at onc showd itslf by countlss signs. Ths signs wr: Lauriston’s
mission; th abundanc of provisions at Tarútino; th rports coming in
from all sids of th inactivity and disordr of th Frnch; th flow of
rcruits to our rgimnts; th fin wathr; th long rst th Russian
soldirs had njoyd, and th impatinc to do what thy had bn
assmbld for, which usually shows itslf in an army that has bn
rsting; curiosity as to what th Frnch army, so long lost sight of,
was doing; th boldnss with which our outposts now scoutd clos up to
th Frnch stationd at Tarútino; th nws of asy succsss gaind by
pasants and gurrilla troops ovr th Frnch, th nvy arousd by this;
th dsir for rvng that lay in th hart of vry Russian as long as
th Frnch wr in Moscow, and (abov all) a dim consciousnss in vry
soldir’s mind that th rlativ strngth of th armis had changd and
that th advantag was now on our sid. Thr was a substantial chang
in th rlativ strngth, and an advanc had bcom invitabl. And at
onc, as a clock bgins to strik and chim as soon as th minut hand
has compltd a full circl, this chang was shown by an incrasd
activity, whirring, and chiming in th highr sphrs.
CHAPTR III
Th Russian army was commandd by Kutúzov and his staff, and also by th
mpror from Ptrsburg. Bfor th nws of th abandonmnt of Moscow
had bn rcivd in Ptrsburg, a dtaild plan of th whol campaign
had bn drawn up and snt to Kutúzov for his guidanc. Though this plan
had bn drawn up on th supposition that Moscow was still in our hands,
it was approvd by th staff and accptd as a basis for action.
Kutúzov only rplid that movmnts arrangd from a distanc wr always
difficult to xcut. So frsh instructions wr snt for th solution
of difficultis that might b ncountrd, as wll as frsh popl who
wr to watch Kutúzov’s actions and rport upon thm.
Bsids this, th whol staff of th Russian army was now rorganizd.
Th posts lft vacant by Bagratión, who had bn killd, and by
Barclay, who had gon away in dudgon, had to b filld. Vry srious
considration was givn to th qustion whthr it would b bttr to
put A in B’s plac and B in D’s, or on th contrary to put D in A’s
plac, and so on—as if anything mor than A’s or B’s satisfaction
dpndd on this.
As a rsult of th hostility btwn Kutúzov and Bnnigsn, his Chif of
Staff, th prsnc of confidntial rprsntativs of th mpror, and
ths transfrs, a mor than usually complicatd play of partis
was going on among th staff of th army. A was undrmining B, D was
undrmining C, and so on in all possibl combinations and prmutations.
In all ths plottings th subjct of intrigu was gnrally th conduct
of th war, which all ths mn blivd thy wr dircting; but this
affair of th war wnt on indpndntly of thm, as it had to go:
that is, nvr in th way popl dvisd, but flowing always from th
ssntial attitud of th masss. Only in th highst sphrs did
all ths schms, crossings, and intrminglings appar to b a tru
rflction of what had to happn.
Princ Michal Ilariónovich! (wrot th mpror on th scond of Octobr
in a lttr that rachd Kutúzov aftr th battl at Tarútino) Sinc
Sptmbr 2 Moscow has bn in th hands of th nmy. Your last rports
wr writtn on th twntith, and during all this tim not only has
no action bn takn against th nmy or for th rlif of th ancint
capital, but according to your last rport you hav vn rtratd
farthr. Srpukhov is alrady occupid by an nmy dtachmnt and Túla
with its famous arsnal so indispnsabl to th army, is in dangr.
From Gnral Wintzingrod’s rports, I s that an nmy corps of tn
thousand mn is moving on th Ptrsburg road. Anothr corps of svral
thousand mn is moving on Dmítrov. A third has advancd along th
Vladímir road, and a fourth, rathr considrabl dtachmnt is stationd
btwn Rúza and Mozháysk. Napolon himslf was in Moscow as lat as
th twnty-fifth. In viw of all this information, whn th nmy has
scattrd his forcs in larg dtachmnts, and with Napolon and his
Guards in Moscow, is it possibl that th nmy’s forcs confronting you
ar so considrabl as not to allow of your taking th offnsiv? On th
contrary, h is probably pursuing you with dtachmnts, or at most with
an army corps much wakr than th army ntrustd to you. It would sm
that, availing yourslf of ths circumstancs, you might advantagously
attack a wakr on and annihilat him, or at last oblig him to
rtrat, rtaining in our hands an important part of th provincs now
occupid by th nmy, and thrby avrting dangr from Túla and othr
towns in th intrior. You will b rsponsibl if th nmy is abl to
dirct a forc of any siz against Ptrsburg to thratn this capital
in which it has not bn possibl to rtain many troops; for with th
army ntrustd to you, and acting with rsolution and nrgy, you hav
ampl mans to avrt this frsh calamity. Rmmbr that you hav still
to answr to our offndd country for th loss of Moscow. You hav
xprincd my radinss to rward you. That radinss will not wakn
in m, but I and Russia hav a right to xpct from you all th zal,
firmnss, and succss which your intllct, military talnt, and th
courag of th troops you command justify us in xpcting.
But by th tim this lttr, which provd that th ral rlation of
th forcs had alrady mad itslf flt in Ptrsburg, was dispatchd,
Kutúzov had found himslf unabl any longr to rstrain th army h
commandd from attacking and a battl had takn plac.
On th scond of Octobr a Cossack, Shapoválov, who was out scouting,
killd on har and woundd anothr. Following th woundd har h mad
his way far into th forst and cam upon th lft flank of Murat’s
army, ncampd thr without any prcautions. Th Cossack laughingly
told his comrads how h had almost falln into th hands of th Frnch.
A cornt, haring th story, informd his commandr.
Th Cossack was snt for and qustiond. Th Cossack officrs wishd
to tak advantag of this chanc to captur som horss, but on of
th suprior officrs, who was acquaintd with th highr authoritis,
rportd th incidnt to a gnral on th staff. Th stat of things on
th staff had of lat bn xcdingly straind. rmólov had bn to
s Bnnigsn a fw days prviously and had ntratd him to us
his influnc with th commandr in chif to induc him to tak th
offnsiv.
“If I did not know you I should think you did not want what you ar
asking for. I nd only advis anything and his Highnss is sur to do
th opposit,” rplid Bnnigsn.
Th Cossack’s rport, confirmd by hors patrols who wr snt out, was
th final proof that vnts had maturd. Th tightly coild spring was
rlasd, th clock bgan to whirr and th chims to play. Dspit all
his supposd powr, his intllct, his xprinc, and his knowldg
of mn, Kutúzov—having takn into considration th Cossack’s rport, a
not from Bnnigsn who snt prsonal rports to th mpror, th wishs
h supposd th mpror to hold, and th fact that all th gnrals
xprssd th sam wish—could no longr chck th invitabl movmnt,
and gav th ordr to do what h rgardd as uslss and harmful—gav
his approval, that is, to th accomplishd fact.
CHAPTR IV
Bnnigsn’s not and th Cossack’s information that th lft flank
of th Frnch was unguardd wr mrly final indications that it was
ncssary to ordr an attack, and it was fixd for th fifth of Octobr.
On th morning of th fourth of Octobr Kutúzov signd th dispositions.
Toll rad thm to rmólov, asking him to attnd to th furthr
arrangmnts.
“All right—all right. I havn’t tim just now,” rplid rmólov, and
lft th hut.
Th dispositions drawn up by Toll wr vry good. As in th Austrlitz
dispositions, it was writtn—though not in Grman this tim:
“Th First Column will march hr and hr,” “th Scond Column will
march thr and thr,” and so on; and on papr, all ths columns
arrivd at thir placs at th appointd tim and dstroyd th nmy.
vrything had bn admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions,
and as is always th cas, not a singl column rachd its plac at th
appointd tim.
Whn th ncssary numbr of copis of th dispositions had bn
prpard, an officr was summond and snt to dlivr thm to rmólov
to dal with. A young officr of th Hors Guards, Kutúzov’s ordrly,
plasd at th importanc of th mission ntrustd to him, wnt to
rmólov’s quartrs.
“Gon away,” said rmólov’s ordrly.
Th officr of th Hors Guards wnt to a gnral with whom rmólov was
oftn to b found.
“No, and th gnral’s out too.”
Th officr, mounting his hors, rod off to somon ls.
“No, h’s gon out.”
“If only thy don’t mak m rsponsibl for this dlay! What a nuisanc
it is!” thought th officr, and h rod round th whol camp. On man
said h had sn rmólov rid past with som othr gnrals, othrs said
h must hav rturnd hom. Th officr sarchd till six o’clock in th
vning without vn stopping to at. rmólov was nowhr to b found
and no on knw whr h was. Th officr snatchd a littl food at
a comrad’s, and rod again to th vanguard to find Milorádovich.
Milorádovich too was away, but hr h was told that h had gon to a
ball at Gnral Kíkin’s and that rmólov was probably thr too.
“But whr is it?”
“Why, thr, ovr at chkino,” said a Cossack officr, pointing to a
country hous in th far distanc.
“What, outsid our lin?”
“Thy’v put two rgimnts as outposts, and thy’r having such a spr
thr, it’s awful! Two bands and thr sts of singrs!”
Th officr rod out byond our lins to chkino. Whil still at a
distanc h hard as h rod th mrry sounds of a soldir’s danc song
procding from th hous.
“In th madows... in th madows!” h hard, accompanid by whistling
and th sound of a torban, drownd vry now and thn by shouts. Ths
sounds mad his spirits ris, but at th sam tim h was afraid that
h would b blamd for not having xcutd soonr th important ordr
ntrustd to him. It was alrady past ight o’clock. H dismountd
and wnt up into th porch of a larg country hous which had rmaind
intact btwn th Russian and Frnch forcs. In th rfrshmnt room
and th hall, footmn wr bustling about with win and viands. Groups
of singrs stood outsid th windows. Th officr was admittd and
immdiatly saw all th chif gnrals of th army togthr, and among
thm rmólov’s big imposing figur. Thy all had thir coats unbuttond
and wr standing in a smicircl with flushd and animatd facs,
laughing loudly. In th middl of th room a short handsom gnral with
a rd fac was dancing th trpák with much spirit and agility.
“Ha, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Iványch! Ha, ha, ha!”
Th officr flt that by arriving with important ordrs at such a momnt
h was doubly to blam, and h would hav prfrrd to wait; but on of
th gnrals spid him and, haring what h had com about, informd
rmólov.
rmólov cam forward with a frown on his fac and, haring what th
officr had to say, took th paprs from him without a word.
“You think h wnt off just by chanc?” said a comrad, who was on th
staff that vning, to th officr of th Hors Guards, rfrring to
rmólov. “It was a trick. It was don on purpos to gt Konovnítsyn into
troubl. You’ll s what a mss thr’ll b tomorrow.”
CHAPTR V
Nxt day th dcrpit Kutúzov, having givn ordrs to b calld arly,
said his prayrs, drssd, and, with an unplasant consciousnss of
having to dirct a battl h did not approv of, got into his calèch
and drov from Ltashóvka (a villag thr and a half mils from
Tarútino) to th plac whr th attacking columns wr to mt. H sat
in th calèch, dozing and waking up by turns, and listning for any
sound of firing on th right as an indication that th action had bgun.
But all was still quit. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On
approaching Tarútino Kutúzov noticd cavalrymn lading thir horss to
watr across th road along which h was driving. Kutúzov lookd at
thm sarchingly, stoppd his carriag, and inquird what rgimnt thy
blongd to. Thy blongd to a column that should hav bn far in
front and in ambush long bfor thn. “It may b a mistak,” thought
th old commandr in chif. But a littl furthr on h saw infantry
rgimnts with thir arms pild and th soldirs, only partly drssd,
ating thir ry porridg and carrying ful. H snt for an officr. Th
officr rportd that no ordr to advanc had bn rcivd.
“How! Not rc...” Kutúzov bgan, but chckd himslf immdiatly and
snt for a snior officr. Gtting out of his calèch, h waitd with
drooping had and brathing havily, pacing silntly up and down. Whn
ýkhn, th officr of th gnral staff whom h had summond, appard,
Kutúzov wnt purpl in th fac, not bcaus that officr was to blam
for th mistak, but bcaus h was an objct of sufficint importanc
for him to vnt his wrath on. Trmbling and panting th old man fll
into that stat of fury in which h somtims usd to roll on th
ground, and h fll upon ýkhn, thratning him with his hands,
shouting and loading him with gross abus. Anothr man, Captain Brózin,
who happnd to turn up and who was not at all to blam, suffrd th
sam fat.
“What sort of anothr blackguard ar you? I’ll hav you shot!
Scoundrls!” ylld Kutúzov in a hoars voic, waving his arms and
rling.
H was suffring physically. H, th commandr in chif, a Srn
Highnss who vrybody said possssd powrs such as no man had vr had
in Russia, to b placd in this position—mad th laughingstock of th
whol army! “I ndn’t hav bn in such a hurry to pray about today,
or hav kpt awak thinking vrything ovr all night,” thought h to
himslf. “Whn I was a chit of an officr no on would hav dard to
mock m so... and now!” H was in a stat of physical suffring as if
from corporal punishmnt, and could not avoid xprssing it by cris of
angr and distrss. But his strngth soon bgan to fail him, and looking
about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, h again got
into his calèch and drov back in silnc.
His wrath, onc xpndd, did not rturn, and blinking fbly h
listnd to xcuss and slf-justifications (rmólov did not com to s
him till th nxt day) and to th insistnc of Bnnigsn, Konovnítsyn,
and Toll that th movmnt that had miscarrid should b xcutd nxt
day. And onc mor Kutúzov had to consnt.
CHAPTR VI
Nxt day th troops assmbld in thir appointd placs in th vning
and advancd during th night. It was an autumn night with dark purpl
clouds, but no rain. Th ground was damp but not muddy, and th troops
advancd noislssly, only occasionally a jingling of th artillry
could b faintly hard. Th mn wr forbiddn to talk out loud, to
smok thir pips, or to strik a light, and thy trid to prvnt thir
horss nighing. Th scrcy of th undrtaking hightnd its charm
and thy marchd gaily. Som columns, supposing thy had rachd thir
dstination, haltd, pild arms, and sttld down on th cold ground,
but th majority marchd all night and arrivd at placs whr thy
vidntly should not hav bn.
Only Count Orlóv-Dnísov with his Cossacks (th last important
dtachmnt of all) got to his appointd plac at th right tim. This
dtachmnt haltd at th outskirts of a forst, on th path lading from
th villag of Stromílova to Dmítrovsk.
Toward dawn, Count Orlóv-Dnísov, who had dozd off, was awaknd by a
dsrtr from th Frnch army bing brought to him. This was a Polish
srgant of Poniatowski’s corps, who xplaind in Polish that h had
com ovr bcaus h had bn slightd in th srvic: that h ought
long ago to hav bn mad an officr, that h was bravr than any of
thm, and so h had lft thm and wishd to pay thm out. H said that
Murat was spnding th night lss than a mil from whr thy wr,
and that if thy would lt him hav a convoy of a hundrd mn h would
captur him aliv. Count Orlóv-Dnísov consultd his fllow officrs.
Th offr was too tmpting to b rfusd. vryon voluntrd to go and
vrybody advisd making th attmpt. Aftr much disputing and arguing,
Major-Gnral Grkov with two Cossack rgimnts dcidd to go with th
Polish srgant.
“Now, rmmbr,” said Count Orlóv-Dnísov to th srgant at parting,
“if you hav bn lying I’ll hav you hangd lik a dog; but if it’s
tru you shall hav a hundrd gold pics!”
Without rplying, th srgant, with a rsolut air, mountd and rod
away with Grkov whos mn had quickly assmbld. Thy disappard into
th forst, and Count Orlóv-Dnísov, having sn Grkov off, rturnd,
shivring from th frshnss of th arly dawn and xcitd by what h
had undrtakn on his own rsponsibility, and bgan looking at th nmy
camp, now just visibl in th dcptiv light of dawn and th dying
campfirs. Our columns ought to hav bgun to appar on an opn
dclivity to his right. H lookd in that dirction, but though th
columns would hav bn visibl quit far off, thy wr not to b sn.
It smd to th count that things wr bginning to stir in th Frnch
camp, and his kn-sightd adjutant confirmd this.
“Oh, it is rally too lat,” said Count Orlóv, looking at th camp.
As oftn happns whn somon w hav trustd is no longr bfor
our ys, it suddnly smd quit clar and obvious to him that th
srgant was an impostor, that h had lid, and that th whol Russian
attack would b ruind by th absnc of thos two rgimnts, which
h would lad away havn only knw whr. How could on captur a
commandr in chif from among such a mass of troops!
“I am sur that rascal was lying,” said th count.
“Thy can still b calld back,” said on of his suit, who lik Count
Orlóv flt distrustful of th advntur whn h lookd at th nmy’s
camp.
“h? Rally... what do you think? Should w lt thm go on or not?”
“Will you hav thm ftchd back?”
“Ftch thm back, ftch thm back!” said Count Orlóv with suddn
dtrmination, looking at his watch. “It will b too lat. It is quit
light.”
And th adjutant gallopd through th forst aftr Grkov. Whn Grkov
rturnd, Count Orlóv-Dnísov, xcitd both by th abandond attmpt and
by vainly awaiting th infantry columns that still did not appar, as
wll as by th proximity of th nmy, rsolvd to advanc. All his mn
flt th sam xcitmnt.
“Mount!” h commandd in a whispr. Th mn took thir placs and
crossd thmslvs.... “Forward, with God’s aid!”
“Hurrah-ah-ah!” rvrbratd in th forst, and th Cossack companis,
trailing thir lancs and advancing on aftr anothr as if pourd out
of a sack, dashd gaily across th brook toward th camp.
On dsprat, frightnd yll from th first Frnch soldir who saw th
Cossacks, and all who wr in th camp, undrssd and only just waking
up, ran off in all dirctions, abandoning cannons, muskts, and horss.
Had th Cossacks pursud th Frnch, without hding what was bhind and
around thm, thy would hav capturd Murat and vrything thr.
That was what th officrs dsird. But it was impossibl to mak th
Cossacks budg whn onc thy had got booty and prisonrs. Non of thm
listnd to ordrs. Fiftn hundrd prisonrs and thirty-ight guns wr
takn on th spot, bsids standards and (what smd most important to
th Cossacks) horss, saddls, horscloths, and th lik. All this had
to b dalt with, th prisonrs and guns scurd, th booty dividd—not
without som shouting and vn a littl fighting among thmslvs—and it
was on this that th Cossacks all busid thmslvs.
Th Frnch, not bing farthr pursud, bgan to rcovr thmslvs: thy
formd into dtachmnts and bgan firing. Orlóv-Dnísov, still waiting
for th othr columns to arriv, advancd no furthr.
Mantim, according to th dispositions which said that “th First
Column will march” and so on, th infantry of th blatd columns,
commandd by Bnnigsn and dirctd by Toll, had startd in du ordr
and, as always happns, had got somwhr, but not to thir appointd
placs. As always happns th mn, starting chrfully, bgan to halt;
murmurs wr hard, thr was a sns of confusion, and finally a
backward movmnt. Adjutants and gnrals gallopd about, shoutd, grw
angry, quarrld, said thy had com quit wrong and wr lat, gav
vnt to a littl abus, and at last gav it all up and wnt forward,
simply to gt somwhr. “W shall gt somwhr or othr!” And thy did
indd gt somwhr, though not to thir right placs; a fw vntually
vn got to thir right plac, but too lat to b of any us and only
in tim to b fird at. Toll, who in this battl playd th part of
Wyrothr at Austrlitz, gallopd assiduously from plac to plac,
finding vrything upsid down vrywhr. Thus h stumbld on Bagovút’s
corps in a wood whn it was alrady broad daylight, though th corps
should long bfor hav joind Orlóv-Dnísov. xcitd and vxd by th
failur and supposing that somon must b rsponsibl for it, Toll
gallopd up to th commandr of th corps and bgan upbraiding him
svrly, saying that h ought to b shot. Gnral Bagovút, a fighting
old soldir of placid tmpramnt, bing also upst by all th dlay,
confusion, and cross-purposs, fll into a rag to vrybody’s surpris
and quit contrary to his usual charactr and said disagrabl things
to Toll.
“I prfr not to tak lssons from anyon, but I can di with my mn as
wll as anybody,” h said, and advancd with a singl division.
Coming out onto a fild undr th nmy’s fir, this brav gnral wnt
straight ahad, lading his mn undr fir, without considring in his
agitation whthr going into action now, with a singl division, would
b of any us or no. Dangr, cannon balls, and bullts wr just what h
ndd in his angry mood. On of th first bullts killd him, and othr
bullts killd many of his mn. And his division rmaind undr fir for
som tim quit uslssly.
CHAPTR VII
Manwhil anothr column was to hav attackd th Frnch from th front,
but Kutúzov accompanid that column. H wll knw that nothing but
confusion would com of this battl undrtakn against his will, and as
far as was in his powr hld th troops back. H did not advanc.
H rod silntly on his small gray hors, indolntly answring
suggstions that thy should attack.
“Th word attack is always on your tongu, but you don’t s that w ar
unabl to xcut complicatd manuvrs,” said h to Milorádovich who
askd prmission to advanc.
“W couldn’t tak Murat prisonr this morning or gt to th plac in
tim, and nothing can b don now!” h rplid to somon ls.
Whn Kutúzov was informd that at th Frnch rar—whr according to th
rports of th Cossacks thr had prviously bn nobody—thr wr now
two battalions of Pols, h gav a sidlong glanc at rmólov who was
bhind him and to whom h had not spokn sinc th prvious day.
“You s! Thy ar asking to attack and making plans of all kinds,
but as soon as on gts to businss nothing is rady, and th nmy,
forwarnd, taks masurs accordingly.”
rmólov scrwd up his ys and smild faintly on haring ths words.
H undrstood that for him th storm had blown ovr, and that Kutúzov
would contnt himslf with that hint.
“H’s having a littl fun at my xpns,” said rmólov softly, nudging
with his kn Ravski who was at his sid.
Soon aftr this, rmólov movd up to Kutúzov and rspctfully rmarkd:
“It is not too lat yt, your Highnss—th nmy has not gon away—if
you wr to ordr an attack! If not, th Guards will not so much as s
a littl smok.”
Kutúzov did not rply, but whn thy rportd to him that Murat’s troops
wr in rtrat h ordrd an advanc, though at vry hundrd pacs h
haltd for thr quartrs of an hour.
Th whol battl consistd in what Orlóv-Dnísov’s Cossacks had don:
th rst of th army mrly lost som hundrds of mn uslssly.
In consqunc of this battl Kutúzov rcivd a diamond dcoration,
and Bnnigsn som diamonds and a hundrd thousand rubls, othrs also
rcivd plasant rcognitions corrsponding to thir various grads,
and following th battl frsh changs wr mad in th staff.
“That’s how vrything is don with us, all topsy-turvy!” said th
Russian officrs and gnrals aftr th Tarútino battl, ltting it b
undrstood that som fool thr is doing things all wrong but that
w ourslvs should not hav don so, just as popl spak today. But
popl who talk lik that ithr do not know what thy ar talking about
or dlibratly dciv thmslvs. No battl—Tarútino, Borodinó, or
Austrlitz—taks plac as thos who plannd it anticipatd. That is an
ssntial condition.
A countlss numbr of fr forcs (for nowhr is man frr than during
a battl, whr it is a qustion of lif and dath) influnc th cours
takn by th fight, and that cours nvr can b known in advanc and
nvr coincids with th dirction of any on forc.
If many simultanously and variously dirctd forcs act on a givn
body, th dirction of its motion cannot coincid with any on of thos
forcs, but will always b a man—what in mchanics is rprsntd by
th diagonal of a paralllogram of forcs.
If in th dscriptions givn by historians, spcially Frnch ons, w
find thir wars and battls carrid out in accordanc with prviously
formd plans, th only conclusion to b drawn is that thos dscriptions
ar fals.
Th battl of Tarútino obviously did not attain th aim Toll had in
viw—to lad th troops into action in th ordr prscribd by th
dispositions; nor that which Count Orlóv-Dnísov may hav had in viw—to
tak Murat prisonr; nor th rsult of immdiatly dstroying th whol
corps, which Bnnigsn and othrs may hav had in viw; nor th aim of
th officr who wishd to go into action to distinguish himslf; nor
that of th Cossack who wantd mor booty than h got, and so on. But
if th aim of th battl was what actually rsultd and what all th
Russians of that day dsird—to driv th Frnch out of Russia and
dstroy thir army—it is quit clar that th battl of Tarútino, just
bcaus of its incongruitis, was xactly what was wantd at that stag
of th campaign. It would b difficult and vn impossibl to imagin
any rsult mor opportun than th actual outcom of this battl. With
a minimum of ffort and insignificant losss, dspit th gratst
confusion, th most important rsults of th whol campaign wr
attaind: th transition from rtrat to advanc, an xposur of th
waknss of th Frnch, and th administration of that shock which
Napolon’s army had only awaitd to bgin its flight.
CHAPTR VIII
Napolon ntrs Moscow aftr th brilliant victory d la Moskowa; thr
can b no doubt about th victory for th battlfild rmains in th
hands of th Frnch. Th Russians rtrat and abandon thir ancint
capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and
incalculabl walth, is in Napolon’s hands. Th Russian army, only half
th strngth of th Frnch, dos not mak a singl attmpt to attack for
a whol month. Napolon’s position is most brilliant. H can ithr fall
on th Russian army with doubl its strngth and dstroy it; ngotiat
an advantagous pac, or in cas of a rfusal mak a mnacing mov on
Ptrsburg, or vn, in th cas of a rvrs, rturn to Smolnsk or
Vílna; or rmain in Moscow; in short, no spcial gnius would sm to b
rquird to rtain th brilliant position th Frnch hld at that tim.
For that, only vry simpl and asy stps wr ncssary: not to allow
th troops to loot, to prpar wintr clothing—of which thr was
sufficint in Moscow for th whol army—and mthodically to collct th
provisions, of which (according to th Frnch historians) thr wr
nough in Moscow to supply th whol army for six months. Yt Napolon,
that gratst of all gniuss, who th historians dclar had control of
th army, took non of ths stps.
H not mrly did nothing of th kind, but on th contrary h usd his
powr to slct th most foolish and ruinous of all th courss opn
to him. Of all that Napolon might hav don: wintring in Moscow,
advancing on Ptrsburg or on Nízhni-Nóvgorod, or rtiring by a mor
northrly or mor southrly rout (say by th road Kutúzov aftrwards
took), nothing mor stupid or disastrous can b imagind than what h
actually did. H rmaind in Moscow till Octobr, ltting th troops
plundr th city; thn, hsitating whthr to lav a garrison bhind
him, h quittd Moscow, approachd Kutúzov without joining battl,
turnd to th right and rachd Málo-Yaroslávts, again without
attmpting to brak through and tak th road Kutúzov took, but rtiring
instad to Mozháysk along th dvastatd Smolnsk road. Nothing mor
stupid than that could hav bn dvisd, or mor disastrous for th
army, as th squl showd. Had Napolon’s aim bn to dstroy his army,
th most skillful stratgist could hardly hav dvisd any sris
of actions that would so compltly hav accomplishd that purpos,
indpndntly of anything th Russian army might do.
Napolon, th man of gnius, did this! But to say that h dstroyd his
army bcaus h wishd to, or bcaus h was vry stupid, would b as
unjust as to say that h had brought his troops to Moscow bcaus h
wishd to and bcaus h was vry clvr and a gnius.
In both cass his prsonal activity, having no mor forc than th
prsonal activity of any soldir, mrly coincidd with th laws that
guidd th vnt.
Th historians quit falsly rprsnt Napolon’s facultis as having
waknd in Moscow, and do so only bcaus th rsults did not justify
his actions. H mployd all his ability and strngth to do th bst h
could for himslf and his army, as h had don prviously and as h did
subsquntly in 1813. His activity at that tim was no lss astounding
than it was in gypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. W do not
know for crtain in how far his gnius was gnuin in gypt—whr forty
cnturis lookd down upon his grandur—for his grat xploits thr ar
all told us by Frnchmn. W cannot accuratly stimat his gnius in
Austria or Prussia, for w hav to draw our information from Frnch
or Grman sourcs, and th incomprhnsibl surrndr of whol corps
without fighting and of fortrsss without a sig must inclin Grmans
to rcogniz his gnius as th only xplanation of th war carrid on
in Grmany. But w, thank God, hav no nd to rcogniz his gnius
in ordr to hid our sham. W hav paid for th right to look at th
mattr plainly and simply, and w will not abandon that right.
His activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of gnius as
lswhr. Ordr aftr ordr and plan aftr plan wr issud by him
from th tim h ntrd Moscow till th tim h lft it. Th absnc
of citizns and of a dputation, and vn th burning of Moscow, did not
disconcrt him. H did not los sight ithr of th wlfar of his
army or of th doings of th nmy, or of th wlfar of th popl
of Russia, or of th dirction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic
considrations concrning th trms of th anticipatd pac.
CHAPTR IX
With rgard to military mattrs, Napolon immdiatly on his ntry into
Moscow gav Gnral Sabastiani strict ordrs to obsrv th movmnts
of th Russian army, snt army corps out along th diffrnt roads, and
chargd Murat to find Kutúzov. Thn h gav carful dirctions about th
fortification of th Krmlin, and drw up a brilliant plan for a futur
campaign ovr th whol map of Russia.
With rgard to diplomatic qustions, Napolon summond Captain Yákovlv,
who had bn robbd and was in rags and did not know how to gt out of
Moscow, minutly xplaind to him his whol policy and his magnanimity,
and having writtn a lttr to th mpror Alxandr in which h
considrd it his duty to inform his Frind and Brothr that Rostopchín
had managd affairs badly in Moscow, h dispatchd Yákovlv to
Ptrsburg.
Having similarly xplaind his viws and his magnanimity to Tutólmin, h
dispatchd that old man also to Ptrsburg to ngotiat.
With rgard to lgal mattrs, immdiatly aftr th firs h gav ordrs
to find and xcut th incndiaris. And th scoundrl Rostopchín was
punishd by an ordr to burn down his houss.
With rgard to administrativ mattrs, Moscow was grantd a
constitution. A municipality was stablishd and th following
announcmnt issud:
INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!
Your misfortuns ar crul, but His Majsty th mpror and King
dsirs to arrst thir cours. Trribl xampls hav taught you how h
punishs disobdinc and crim. Strict masurs hav bn takn to
put an nd to disordr and to r-stablish public scurity. A
patrnal administration, chosn from among yourslvs, will form your
municipality or city govrnmnt. It will tak car of you, of your
nds, and of your wlfar. Its mmbrs will b distinguishd by a rd
ribbon worn across th shouldr, and th mayor of th city will war
a whit blt as wll. But whn not on duty thy will only war a rd
ribbon round th lft arm.
Th city polic is stablishd on its formr footing, and bttr ordr
alrady prvails in consqunc of its activity. Th govrnmnt has
appointd two commissaris gnral, or chifs of polic, and twnty
commissaris or captains of wards hav bn appointd to th diffrnt
wards of th city. You will rcogniz thm by th whit ribbon thy will
war on th lft arm. Svral churchs of diffrnt dnominations ar
opn, and divin srvic is prformd in thm unhindrd. Your fllow
citizns ar rturning vry day to thir homs and ordrs hav bn
givn that thy should find in thm th hlp and protction du to
thir misfortuns. Ths ar th masurs th govrnmnt has adoptd to
r-stablish ordr and rliv your condition. But to achiv this
aim it is ncssary that you should add your fforts and should, if
possibl, forgt th misfortuns you hav suffrd, should ntrtain
th hop of a lss crul fat, should b crtain that invitabl and
ignominious dath awaits thos who mak any attmpt on your prsons or
on what rmains of your proprty, and finally that you should not doubt
that ths will b safguardd, sinc such is th will of th gratst
and most just of monarchs. Soldirs and citizns, of whatvr nation you
may b, r-stablish public confidnc, th sourc of th wlfar of
a stat, liv lik brothrs, rndr mutual aid and protction on to
anothr, unit to dfat th intntions of th vil-mindd, oby th
military and civil authoritis, and your tars will soon cas to flow!
With rgard to supplis for th army, Napolon dcrd that all th
troops in turn should ntr Moscow à la maraud * to obtain provisions
for thmslvs, so that th army might hav its futur providd for.
    * As lootrs.
With rgard to rligion, Napolon ordrd th prists to b brought back
and srvics to b again prformd in th churchs.
With rgard to commrc and to provisioning th army, th following was
placardd vrywhr:
PROCLAMATION
You, pacful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmn whom
misfortun has drivn from th city, and you scattrd tillrs of
th soil, still kpt out in th filds by groundlss far, listn!
Tranquillity is rturning to this capital and ordr is bing rstord in
it. Your fllow countrymn ar mrging boldly from thir hiding placs
on finding that thy ar rspctd. Any violnc to thm or to thir
proprty is promptly punishd. His Majsty th mpror and King protcts
thm, and considrs no on among you his nmy xcpt thos who disoby
his ordrs. H dsirs to nd your misfortuns and rstor you to your
homs and familis. Rspond, thrfor, to his bnvolnt intntions
and com to us without far. Inhabitants, rturn with confidnc to your
abods! You will soon find mans of satisfying your nds. Craftsmn
and industrious artisans, rturn to your work, your houss, your shops,
whr th protction of guards awaits you! You shall rciv propr pay
for your work. And lastly you too, pasants, com from th forsts whr
you ar hiding in trror, rturn to your huts without far, in full
assuranc that you will find protction! Markts ar stablishd in th
city whr pasants can bring thir surplus supplis and th products of
th soil. Th govrnmnt has takn th following stps to nsur frdom
of sal for thm: (1) From today, pasants, husbandmn, and thos
living in th nighborhood of Moscow may without any dangr bring thir
supplis of all kinds to two appointd markts, of which on is on
th Mokhováya Strt and th othr at th Provision Markt. (2) Such
supplis will b bought from thm at such prics as sllr and buyr may
agr on, and if a sllr is unabl to obtain a fair pric h will b
fr to tak his goods back to his villag and no on may hindr him
undr any prtns. (3) Sunday and Wdnsday of ach wk ar appointd
as th chif markt days and to that nd a sufficint numbr of troops
will b stationd along th highroads on Tusdays and Saturdays at such
distancs from th town as to protct th carts. (4) Similar masurs
will b takn that pasants with thir carts and horss may mt with no
hindranc on thir rturn journy. (5) Stps will immdiatly b takn
to r-stablish ordinary trading.
Inhabitants of th city and villags, and you, workingmn and artisans,
to whatvr nation you blong, you ar calld on to carry out th
patrnal intntions of His Majsty th mpror and King and to
co-oprat with him for th public wlfar! Lay your rspct and
confidnc at his ft and do not dlay to unit with us!
With th objct of raising th spirits of th troops and of th popl,
rviws wr constantly hld and rwards distributd. Th mpror
rod through th strts to comfort th inhabitants, and, dspit his
proccupation with stat affairs, himslf visitd th thatrs that wr
stablishd by his ordr.
In rgard to philanthropy, th gratst virtu of crownd hads,
Napolon also did all in his powr. H causd th words Maison d ma
Mèr to b inscribd on th charitabl institutions, thrby combining
tndr filial affction with th majstic bnvolnc of a monarch. H
visitd th Foundling Hospital and, allowing th orphans savd by him
to kiss his whit hands, graciously convrsd with Tutólmin. Thn, as
Thirs loquntly rcounts, h ordrd his soldirs to b paid in forgd
Russian mony which h had prpard: “Raising th us of ths mans
by an act worthy of himslf and of th Frnch army, h lt rlif
b distributd to thos who had bn burnd out. But as food was too
prcious to b givn to forignrs, who wr for th most part nmis,
Napolon prfrrd to supply thm with mony with which to purchas food
from outsid, and had papr rubls distributd to thm.”
With rfrnc to army disciplin, ordrs wr continually bing issud
to inflict svr punishmnt for th nonprformanc of military dutis
and to supprss robbry.
CHAPTR X
But strang to say, all ths masurs, fforts, and plans—which wr
not at all wors than othrs issud in similar circumstancs—did not
affct th ssnc of th mattr but, lik th hands of a clock dtachd
from th mchanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimlss way without
ngaging th cogwhls.
With rfrnc to th military sid—th plan of campaign—that work of
gnius of which Thirs rmarks that, “His gnius nvr dvisd anything
mor profound, mor skillful, or mor admirabl,” and ntrs into a
polmic with M. Fain to prov that this work of gnius must b rfrrd
not to th fourth but to th fiftnth of Octobr—that plan nvr was or
could b xcutd, for it was quit out of touch with th facts of th
cas. Th fortifying of th Krmlin, for which la Mosqu (as Napolon
trmd th church of Basil th Batifid) was to hav bn razd to
th ground, provd quit uslss. Th mining of th Krmlin only hlpd
toward fulfilling Napolon’s wish that it should b blown up whn h
lft Moscow—as a child wants th floor on which h has hurt himslf to
b batn. Th pursuit of th Russian army, about which Napolon was so
concrnd, producd an unhard-of rsult. Th Frnch gnrals lost touch
with th Russian army of sixty thousand mn, and according to Thirs it
was only vntually found, lik a lost pin, by th skill—and apparntly
th gnius—of Murat.
With rfrnc to diplomacy, all Napolon’s argumnts as to his
magnanimity and justic, both to Tutólmin and to Yákovlv (whos chif
concrn was to obtain a gratcoat and a convyanc), provd uslss;
Alxandr did not rciv ths nvoys and did not rply to thir
mbassag.
With rgard to lgal mattrs, aftr th xcution of th supposd
incndiaris th rst of Moscow burnd down.
With rgard to administrativ mattrs, th stablishmnt of a
municipality did not stop th robbris and was only of us to crtain
popl who formd part of that municipality and undr prtxt of
prsrving ordr lootd Moscow or savd thir own proprty from bing
lootd.
With rgard to rligion, as to which in gypt mattrs had so asily bn
sttld by Napolon’s visit to a mosqu, no rsults wr achivd.
Two or thr prists who wr found in Moscow did try to carry out
Napolon’s wish, but on of thm was slappd in th fac by a Frnch
soldir whil conducting srvic, and a Frnch official rportd of
anothr that: “Th prist whom I found and invitd to say Mass cland
and lockd up th church. That night th doors wr again brokn
opn, th padlocks smashd, th books mutilatd, and othr disordrs
prptratd.”
With rfrnc to commrc, th proclamation to industrious workmn and
to pasants vokd no rspons. Thr wr no industrious workmn, and
th pasants caught th commissaris who vnturd too far out of town
with th proclamation and killd thm.
As to th thatrs for th ntrtainmnt of th popl and th troops,
ths did not mt with succss ithr. Th thatrs st up in th
Krmlin and in Posnyákov’s hous wr closd again at onc bcaus th
actors and actrsss wr robbd.
vn philanthropy did not hav th dsird ffct. Th gnuin as
wll as th fals papr mony which floodd Moscow lost its valu. Th
Frnch, collcting booty, card only for gold. Not only was th
papr mony valulss which Napolon so graciously distributd to th
unfortunat, but vn silvr lost its valu in rlation to gold.
But th most amazing xampl of th inffctivnss of th ordrs givn
by th authoritis at that tim was Napolon’s attmpt to stop th
looting and r-stablish disciplin.
This is what th army authoritis wr rporting:
“Looting continus in th city dspit th dcrs against it. Ordr
is not yt rstord and not a singl mrchant is carrying on trad in a
lawful mannr. Th sutlrs alon vntur to trad, and thy sll stoln
goods.”
“Th nighborhood of my ward continus to b pillagd by soldirs of
th 3rd Corps who, not satisfid with taking from th unfortunat
inhabitants hiding in th cllars th littl thy hav lft, vn hav
th frocity to wound thm with thir sabrs, as I hav rpatdly
witnssd.”
“Nothing nw, xcpt that th soldirs ar robbing and pillaging—Octobr
9.”
“Robbry and pillaging continu. Thr is a band of thivs in our
district who ought to b arrstd by a strong forc—Octobr 11.”
“Th mpror is xtrmly displasd that dspit th strict ordrs to
stop pillag, partis of marauding Guards ar continually sn rturning
to th Krmlin. Among th Old Guard disordr and pillag wr rnwd
mor violntly than vr ystrday vning, last night, and today. Th
mpror ss with rgrt that th pickd soldirs appointd to guard his
prson, who should st an xampl of disciplin, carry disobdinc to
such a point that thy brak into th cllars and stors containing army
supplis. Othrs hav disgracd thmslvs to th xtnt of disobying
sntinls and officrs, and hav abusd and batn thm.”
“Th Grand Marshal of th palac,” wrot th govrnor, “complains
bittrly that in spit of rpatd ordrs, th soldirs continu to
commit nuisancs in all th courtyards and vn undr th vry windows
of th mpror.”
That army, lik a hrd of cattl run wild and trampling undrfoot th
provndr which might hav savd it from starvation, disintgratd and
prishd with ach additional day it rmaind in Moscow. But it did not
go away.
It bgan to run away only whn suddnly sizd by a panic causd by th
captur of transport trains on th Smolnsk road, and by th battl of
Tarútino. Th nws of that battl of Tarútino, unxpctdly rcivd
by Napolon at a rviw, vokd in him a dsir to punish th Russians
(Thirs says), and h issud th ordr for dpartur which th whol
army was dmanding.
Fling from Moscow th soldirs took with thm vrything thy had
stoln. Napolon, too, carrid away his own prsonal trsor, but on
sing th baggag trains that impdd th army, h was (Thirs says)
horror-struck. And yt with his xprinc of war h did not ordr all
th suprfluous vhicls to b burnd, as h had don with thos of a
crtain marshal whn approaching Moscow. H gazd at th calèchs and
carriags in which soldirs wr riding and rmarkd that it was a vry
good thing, as thos vhicls could b usd to carry provisions, th
sick, and th woundd.
Th plight of th whol army rsmbld that of a woundd animal which
fls it is prishing and dos not know what it is doing. To study th
skillful tactics and aims of Napolon and his army from th tim it
ntrd Moscow till it was dstroyd is lik studying th dying laps
and shuddrs of a mortally woundd animal. Vry oftn a woundd animal,
haring a rustl, rushs straight at th huntr’s gun, runs forward and
back again, and hastns its own nd. Napolon, undr prssur from his
whol army, did th sam thing. Th rustl of th battl of Tarútino
frightnd th bast, and it rushd forward onto th huntr’s gun,
rachd him, turnd back, and finally—lik any wild bast—ran back along
th most disadvantagous and dangrous path, whr th old scnt was
familiar.
During th whol of that priod Napolon, who sms to us to hav bn
th ladr of all ths movmnts—as th figurhad of a ship may sm
to a savag to guid th vssl—actd lik a child who, holding a coupl
of strings insid a carriag, thinks h is driving it.
CHAPTR XI
arly in th morning of th sixth of Octobr Pirr wnt out of th
shd, and on rturning stoppd by th door to play with a littl
blu-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy lgs, that jumpd about
him. This littl dog livd in thir shd, slping bsid Karatáv at
night; it somtims mad xcursions into th town but always rturnd
again. Probably it had nvr had an ownr, and it still blongd to
nobody and had no nam. Th Frnch calld it Azor; th soldir who
told storis calld it Fmgálka; Karatáv and othrs calld it Gray, or
somtims Flabby. Its lack of a mastr, a nam, or vn of a brd or
any dfinit color did not sm to troubl th blu-gray dog in th
last. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plum, its bandy lgs
srvd it so wll that it would oftn gracfully lift a hind lg and run
vry asily and quickly on thr lgs, as if disdaining to us all
four. vrything plasd it. Now it would roll on its back, ylping with
dlight, now bask in th sun with a thoughtful air of importanc, and
now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.
Pirr’s attir by now consistd of a dirty torn shirt (th only
rmnant of his formr clothing), a pair of soldir’s trousrs which by
Karatáv’s advic h tid with string round th ankls for warmth, and
a pasant coat and cap. Physically h had changd much during this
tim. H no longr smd stout, though h still had th apparanc of
solidity and strngth hrditary in his family. A bard and mustach
covrd th lowr part of his fac, and a tangl of hair, infstd
with lic, curld round his had lik a cap. Th look of his ys
was rsolut, calm, and animatdly alrt, as nvr bfor. Th formr
slacknss which had shown itslf vn in his ys was now rplacd by an
nrgtic radinss for action and rsistanc. His ft wr bar.
Pirr first lookd down th fild across which vhicls and horsmn
wr passing that morning, thn into th distanc across th rivr, thn
at th dog who was prtnding to b in arnst about biting him,
and thn at his bar ft which h placd with plasur in various
positions, moving his dirty thick big tos. vry tim h lookd at his
bar ft a smil of animatd slf-satisfaction flittd across his fac.
Th sight of thm rmindd him of all h had xprincd and larnd
during ths wks and this rcollction was plasant to him.
For som days th wathr had bn calm and clar with slight frosts in
th mornings—what is calld an “old wivs’ summr.”
In th sunshin th air was warm, and that warmth was particularly
plasant with th invigorating frshnss of th morning frost still in
th air.
On vrything—far and nar—lay th magic crystal glittr sn only at
that tim of autumn. Th Sparrow Hills wr visibl in th distanc,
with th villag, th church, and th larg whit hous. Th bar trs,
th sand, th bricks and roofs of th houss, th grn church spir,
and th cornrs of th whit hous in th distanc, all stood out in th
transparnt air in most dlicat outlin and with unnatural clarnss.
Nar by could b sn th familiar ruins of a half-burnd mansion
occupid by th Frnch, with lilac bushs still showing dark grn
bsid th fnc. And vn that ruind and bfould hous—which in dull
wathr was rpulsivly ugly—smd quitly bautiful now, in th clar,
motionlss brillianc.
A Frnch corporal, with coat unbuttond in a homly way, a skullcap on
his had, and a short pip in his mouth, cam from bhind a cornr of
th shd and approachd Pirr with a frindly wink.
“What sunshin, Monsiur Kiril!” (Thir nam for Pirr.) “h? Just lik
spring!”
And th corporal land against th door and offrd Pirr his pip,
though whnvr h offrd it Pirr always dclind it.
“To b on th march in such wathr...” h bgan.
Pirr inquird what was bing said about laving, and th corporal told
him that narly all th troops wr starting and thr ought to b an
ordr about th prisonrs that day. Sokolóv, on of th soldirs in th
shd with Pirr, was dying, and Pirr told th corporal that somthing
should b don about him. Th corporal rplid that Pirr nd not
worry about that as thy had an ambulanc and a prmannt hospital and
arrangmnts would b mad for th sick, and that in gnral vrything
that could happn had bn forsn by th authoritis.
“Bsids, Monsiur Kiril, you hav only to say a word to th captain,
you know. H is a man who nvr forgts anything. Spak to th captain
whn h maks his round, h will do anything for you.”
(Th captain of whom th corporal spok oftn had long chats with Pirr
and showd him all sorts of favors.)
“‘You s, St. Thomas,’ h said to m th othr day. ‘Monsiur Kiril is
a man of ducation, who spaks Frnch. H is a Russian signur who has
had misfortuns, but h is a man. H knows what’s what.... If h wants
anything and asks m, h won’t gt a rfusal. Whn on has studid, you
s, on liks ducation and wll-brd popl.’ It is for your sak I
mntion it, Monsiur Kiril. Th othr day if it had not bn for you
that affair would hav ndd ill.”
And aftr chatting a whil longr, th corporal wnt away. (Th affair
h had alludd to had happnd a fw days bfor—a fight btwn th
prisonrs and th Frnch soldirs, in which Pirr had succdd in
pacifying his comrads.) Som of th prisonrs who had hard Pirr
talking to th corporal immdiatly askd what th Frnchman had said.
Whil Pirr was rpating what h had bn told about th army laving
Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattrd Frnch soldir cam up to th door of
th shd. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingrs to his forhad by way
of grting, h askd Pirr whthr th soldir Platoch to whom h had
givn a shirt to sw was in that shd.
A wk bfor th Frnch had had boot lathr and linn issud to thm,
which thy had givn out to th prisonrs to mak up into boots and
shirts for thm.
“Rady, rady, dar fllow!” said Karatáv, coming out with a natly
foldd shirt.
Karatáv, on account of th warm wathr and for convninc at work,
was waring only trousrs and a tattrd shirt as black as soot. His
hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lim-tr bast,
and his round fac smd roundr and plasantr than vr.
“A promis is own brothr to prformanc! I said Friday and hr it is,
rady,” said Platón, smiling and unfolding th shirt h had swn.
Th Frnchman glancd around unasily and thn, as if ovrcoming his
hsitation, rapidly thrw off his uniform and put on th shirt. H had
a long, grasy, flowrd silk waistcoat nxt to his sallow, thin bar
body, but no shirt. H was vidntly afraid th prisonrs looking on
would laugh at him, and thrust his had into th shirt hurridly. Non
of th prisonrs said a word.
“S, it fits wll!” Platón kpt rpating, pulling th shirt straight.
Th Frnchman, having pushd his had and hands through, without raising
his ys, lookd down at th shirt and xamind th sams.
“You s, dar man, this is not a swing shop, and I had no propr
tools; and, as thy say, on nds a tool vn to kill a lous,” said
Platón with on of his round smils, obviously plasd with his work.
“It’s good, quit good, thank you,” said th Frnchman, in Frnch, “but
thr must b som linn lft ovr.”
“It will fit bttr still whn it sts to your body,” said Karatáv,
still admiring his handiwork. “You’ll b nic and comfortabl....”
“Thanks, thanks, old fllow.... But th bits lft ovr?” said th
Frnchman again and smild. H took out an assignation rubl not and
gav it to Karatáv. “But giv m th pics that ar ovr.”
Pirr saw that Platón did not want to undrstand what th Frnchman
was saying, and h lookd on without intrfring. Karatáv thankd th
Frnchman for th mony and wnt on admiring his own work. Th Frnchman
insistd on having th pics rturnd that wr lft ovr and askd
Pirr to translat what h said.
“What dos h want th bits for?” said Karatáv. “Thy’d mak fin lg
bands for us. Wll, nvr mind.”
And Karatáv, with a suddnly changd and saddnd xprssion, took
a small bundl of scraps from insid his shirt and gav it to th
Frnchman without looking at him. “Oh dar!” muttrd Karatáv and wnt
away. Th Frnchman lookd at th linn, considrd for a momnt, thn
lookd inquiringly at Pirr and, as if Pirr’s look had told him
somthing, suddnly blushd and shoutd in a squaky voic:
“Platoch! h, Platoch! Kp thm yourslf!” And handing back th odd
bits h turnd and wnt out.
“Thr, look at that,” said Karatáv, swaying his had. “Popl said
thy wr not Christians, but thy too hav souls. It’s what th old
folk usd to say: ‘A swating hand’s an opn hand, a dry hand’s clos.’
H’s nakd, but yt h’s givn it back.”
Karatáv smild thoughtfully and was silnt awhil looking at th
pics.
“But thy’ll mak grand lg bands, dar frind,” h said, and wnt back
into th shd.
CHAPTR XII
Four wks had passd sinc Pirr had bn takn prisonr and though
th Frnch had offrd to mov him from th mn’s to th officrs’ shd,
h had stayd in th shd whr h was first put.
In burnd and dvastatd Moscow Pirr xprincd almost th xtrm
limits of privation a man can ndur; but thanks to his physical
strngth and halth, of which h had till thn bn unconscious, and
thanks spcially to th fact that th privations cam so gradually that
it was impossibl to say whn thy bgan, h ndurd his position
not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this tim h obtaind th
tranquillity and as of mind h had formrly strivn in vain to rach.
H had long sought in diffrnt ways that tranquillity of mind, that
innr harmony which had so imprssd him in th soldirs at th battl
of Borodinó. H had sought it in philanthropy, in Frmasonry, in th
dissipations of town lif, in win, in hroic fats of slf-sacrific,
and in romantic lov for Natásha; h had sought it by rasoning—and all
ths qusts and xprimnts had faild him. And now without thinking
about it h had found that pac and innr harmony only through th
horror of dath, through privation, and through what h rcognizd in
Karatáv.
Thos dradful momnts h had livd through at th xcutions had as it
wr forvr washd away from his imagination and mmory th agitating
thoughts and flings that had formrly smd so important. It did
not now occur to him to think of Russia, or th war, or politics, or
Napolon. It was plain to him that all ths things wr no businss
of his, and that h was not calld on to judg concrning thm and
thrfor could not do so. “Russia and summr wathr ar not bound
togthr,” h thought, rpating words of Karatáv’s which h found
strangly consoling. His intntion of killing Napolon and his
calculations of th cabalistic numbr of th bast of th Apocalyps now
smd to him maninglss and vn ridiculous. His angr with his wif
and anxity that his nam should not b smirchd now smd not mrly
trivial but vn amusing. What concrn was it of his that somwhr or
othr that woman was lading th lif sh prfrrd? What did it mattr
to anybody, and spcially to him, whthr or not thy found out that
thir prisonr’s nam was Count Bzúkhov?
H now oftn rmmbrd his convrsation with Princ Andrw and quit
agrd with him, though h undrstood Princ Andrw’s thoughts somwhat
diffrntly. Princ Andrw had thought and said that happinss could
only b ngativ, but had said it with a shad of bittrnss and irony
as though h was rally saying that all dsir for positiv happinss is
implantd in us mrly to tormnt us and nvr b satisfid. But Pirr
blivd it without any mntal rsrvation. Th absnc of suffring,
th satisfaction of on’s nds and consqunt frdom in th choic of
on’s occupation, that is, of on’s way of lif, now smd to Pirr to
b indubitably man’s highst happinss. Hr and now for th first tim
h fully apprciatd th njoymnt of ating whn h wantd to at,
drinking whn h wantd to drink, slping whn h wantd to slp, of
warmth whn h was cold, of talking to a fllow man whn h wishd to
talk and to har a human voic. Th satisfaction of on’s nds—good
food, clanlinss, and frdom—now that h was dprivd of all this,
smd to Pirr to constitut prfct happinss; and th choic
of occupation, that is, of his way of lif—now that that was so
rstrictd—smd to him such an asy mattr that h forgot that a
suprfluity of th comforts of lif dstroys all joy in satisfying on’s
nds, whil grat frdom in th choic of occupation—such frdom as
his walth, his ducation, and his social position had givn him in his
own lif—is just what maks th choic of occupation insolubly difficult
and dstroys th dsir and possibility of having an occupation.
All Pirr’s daydrams now turnd on th tim whn h would b fr. Yt
subsquntly, and for th rst of his lif, h thought and spok with
nthusiasm of that month of captivity, of thos irrcovrabl, strong,
joyful snsations, and chifly of th complt pac of mind and innr
frdom which h xprincd only during thos wks.
Whn on th first day h got up arly, wnt out of th shd at dawn, and
saw th cupolas and crosss of th Nw Convnt of th Virgin still dark
at first, th hoarfrost on th dusty grass, th Sparrow Hills, and th
woodd banks abov th winding rivr vanishing in th purpl distanc,
whn h flt th contact of th frsh air and hard th nois of th
crows flying from Moscow across th fild, and whn aftrwards light
glamd from th ast and th sun’s rim appard solmnly from bhind a
cloud, and th cupolas and crosss, th hoarfrost, th distanc and th
rivr, all bgan to sparkl in th glad light—Pirr flt a nw joy and
strngth in lif such as h had nvr bfor known. And this not only
stayd with him during th whol of his imprisonmnt, but vn grw in
strngth as th hardships of his position incrasd.
That fling of alrtnss and of radinss for anything was still
furthr strngthnd in him by th high opinion his fllow prisonrs
formd of him soon aftr his arrival at th shd. With his knowldg
of languags, th rspct shown him by th Frnch, his simplicity, his
radinss to giv anything askd of him (h rcivd th allowanc
of thr rubls a wk mad to officrs); with his strngth, which h
showd to th soldirs by prssing nails into th walls of th hut; his
gntlnss to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and
thinking without doing anything (which smd to thm incomprhnsibl),
h appard to thm a rathr mystrious and suprior bing. Th vry
qualitis that had bn a hindranc, if not actually harmful, to him in
th world h had livd in—his strngth, his disdain for th comforts of
lif, his absnt-minddnss and simplicity—hr among ths popl gav
him almost th status of a hro. And Pirr flt that thir opinion
placd rsponsibilitis upon him.
CHAPTR XIII
Th Frnch vacuation bgan on th night btwn th sixth and svnth
of Octobr: kitchns and shds wr dismantld, carts loadd, and troops
and baggag trains startd.
At svn in th morning a Frnch convoy in marching trim, waring shakos
and carrying muskts, knapsacks, and normous sacks, stood in front
of th shds, and animatd Frnch talk mingld with curss soundd all
along th lins.
In th shd vryon was rady, drssd, bltd, shod, and only awaitd
th ordr to start. Th sick soldir, Sokolóv, pal and thin with dark
shadows round his ys, alon sat in his plac barfoot and not drssd.
His ys, prominnt from th maciation of his fac, gazd inquiringly
at his comrads who wr paying no attntion to him, and h moand
rgularly and quitly. It was vidntly not so much his suffrings that
causd him to moan (h had dysntry) as his far and grif at bing
lft alon.
Pirr, girt with a rop round his waist and waring shos Karatáv had
mad for him from som lathr a Frnch soldir had torn off a ta chst
and brought to hav his boots mndd with, wnt up to th sick man and
squattd down bsid him.
“You know, Sokolóv, thy ar not all going away! Thy hav a hospital
hr. You may b bttr off than w othrs,” said Pirr.
“O Lord! Oh, it will b th dath of m! O Lord!” moand th man in a
loudr voic.
“I’ll go and ask thm again dirctly,” said Pirr, rising and going to
th door of th shd.
Just as Pirr rachd th door, th corporal who had offrd him a
pip th day bfor cam up to it with two soldirs. Th corporal and
soldirs wr in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had mtal
straps, and ths changd thir familiar facs.
Th corporal cam, according to ordrs, to shut th door. Th prisonrs
had to b countd bfor bing lt out.
“Corporal, what will thy do with th sick man?...” Pirr bgan.
But vn as h spok h bgan to doubt whthr this was th corporal
h knw or a strangr, so unlik himslf did th corporal sm at that
momnt. Morovr, just as Pirr was spaking a sharp rattl of drums
was suddnly hard from both sids. Th corporal frownd at Pirr’s
words and, uttring som maninglss oaths, slammd th door. Th shd
bcam smidark, and th sharp rattl of th drums on two sids drownd
th sick man’s groans.
“Thr it is!... It again!...” said Pirr to himslf, and an
involuntary shuddr ran down his spin. In th corporal’s changd fac,
in th sound of his voic, in th stirring and dafning nois of th
drums, h rcognizd that mystrious, callous forc which complld
popl against thir will to kill thir fllow mn—that forc th ffct
of which h had witnssd during th xcutions. To far or to try to
scap that forc, to addrss ntratis or xhortations to thos who
srvd as its tools, was uslss. Pirr knw this now. On had to wait
and ndur. H did not again go to th sick man, nor turn to look at
him, but stood frowning by th door of th hut.
Whn that door was opnd and th prisonrs, crowding against on
anothr lik a flock of shp, squzd into th xit, Pirr pushd
his way forward and approachd that vry captain who as th corporal had
assurd him was rady to do anything for him. Th captain was also in
marching kit, and on his cold fac appard that sam it which Pirr
had rcognizd in th corporal’s words and in th roll of th drums.
“Pass on, pass on!” th captain ritratd, frowning strnly, and
looking at th prisonrs who throngd past him.
Pirr wnt up to him, though h knw his attmpt would b vain.
“What now?” th officr askd with a cold look as if not rcognizing
Pirr.
Pirr told him about th sick man.
“H’ll manag to walk, dvil tak him!” said th captain. “Pass on, pass
on!” h continud without looking at Pirr.
“But h is dying,” Pirr again bgan.
“B so good...” shoutd th captain, frowning angrily.
“Dram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...” rattld th drums, and Pirr undrstood
that this mystrious forc compltly controlld ths mn and that it
was now uslss to say any mor.
Th officr prisonrs wr sparatd from th soldirs and told to march
in front. Thr wr about thirty officrs, with Pirr among thm, and
about thr hundrd mn.
Th officrs, who had com from th othr shds, wr all strangrs to
Pirr and much bttr drssd than h. Thy lookd at him and at his
shos mistrustfully, as at an alin. Not far from him walkd a fat major
with a sallow, bloatd, angry fac, who was waring a Kazán drssing
gown tid round with a towl, and who vidntly njoyd th rspct of
his fllow prisonrs. H kpt on hand, in which h claspd his tobacco
pouch, insid th bosom of his drssing gown and hld th stm of his
pip firmly with th othr. Panting and puffing, th major grumbld and
growld at vrybody bcaus h thought h was bing pushd and that
thy wr all hurrying whn thy had nowhr to hurry to and wr
all surprisd at somthing whn thr was nothing to b surprisd at.
Anothr, a thin littl officr, was spaking to vryon, conjcturing
whr thy wr now bing takn and how far thy would gt that day. An
official in flt boots and waring a commissariat uniform ran round from
sid to sid and gazd at th ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his
obsrvations as to what had bn burnd down and what this or that part
of th city was that thy could s. A third officr, who by his accnt
was a Pol, disputd with th commissariat officr, arguing that h was
mistakn in his idntification of th diffrnt wards of Moscow.
“What ar you disputing about?” said th major angrily. “What dos it
mattr whthr it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You s it’s burnd
down, and thr’s an nd of it.... What ar you pushing for? Isn’t th
road wid nough?” said h, turning to a man bhind him who was not
pushing him at all.
“Oh, oh, oh! What hav thy don?” th prisonrs on on sid and anothr
wr hard saying as thy gazd on th charrd ruins. “All byond th
rivr, and Zúbova, and in th Krmlin.... Just look! Thr’s not half of
it lft. Ys, I told you—th whol quartr byond th rivr, and so it
is.”
“Wll, you know it’s burnd, so what’s th us of talking?” said th
major.
As thy passd nar a church in th Khamóvniki (on of th fw unburnd
quartrs of Moscow) th whol mass of prisonrs suddnly startd to on
sid and xclamations of horror and disgust wr hard.
“Ah, th villains! What hathns! Ys; dad, dad, so h is... And
smard with somthing!”
Pirr too drw nar th church whr th thing was that vokd ths
xclamations, and dimly mad out somthing laning against th palings
surrounding th church. From th words of his comrads who saw bttr
than h did, h found that this was th body of a man, st upright
against th palings with its fac smard with soot.
“Go on! What th dvil... Go on! Thirty thousand dvils!...” th convoy
guards bgan cursing and th Frnch soldirs, with frsh virulnc,
drov away with thir swords th crowd of prisonrs who wr gazing at
th dad man.
CHAPTR XIV
Through th cross strts of th Khamóvniki quartr th prisonrs
marchd, followd only by thir scort and th vhicls and wagons
blonging to that scort, but whn thy rachd th supply stors thy
cam among a hug and closly packd train of artillry mingld with
privat vhicls.
At th bridg thy all haltd, waiting for thos in front to gt across.
From th bridg thy had a viw of ndlss lins of moving baggag
trains bfor and bhind thm. To th right, whr th Kalúga road turns
nar Nskúchny, ndlss rows of troops and carts strtchd away into
th distanc. Ths wr troops of Bauharnais’ corps which had startd
bfor any of th othrs. Bhind, along th rivrsid and across th
Ston Bridg, wr Ny’s troops and transport.
Davout’s troops, in whos charg wr th prisonrs, wr crossing th
Criman bridg and som wr alrady dbouching into th Kalúga road.
But th baggag trains strtchd out so that th last of Bauharnais’
train had not yt got out of Moscow and rachd th Kalúga road whn
th vanguard of Ny’s army was alrady mrging from th Grat Ordýnka
Strt.
Whn thy had crossd th Criman bridg th prisonrs movd a fw stps
forward, haltd, and again movd on, and from all sids vhicls and mn
crowdd closr and closr togthr. Thy advancd th fw hundrd pacs
that sparatd th bridg from th Kalúga road, taking mor than an
hour to do so, and cam out upon th squar whr th strts of th
Transmoskvá ward and th Kalúga road convrg, and th prisonrs jammd
clos togthr had to stand for som hours at that crossway. From all
sids, lik th roar of th sa, wr hard th rattl of whls, th
tramp of ft, and incssant shouts of angr and abus. Pirr stood
prssd against th wall of a charrd hous, listning to that nois
which mingld in his imagination with th roll of th drums.
To gt a bttr viw, svral officr prisonrs climbd onto th wall of
th half-burnd hous against which Pirr was laning.
“What crowds! Just look at th crowds!... Thy’v loadd goods vn on
th cannon! Look thr, thos ar furs!” thy xclaimd. “Just s what
th blackguards hav lootd.... Thr! S what that on has bhind
in th cart.... Why, thos ar sttings takn from som icons, by
havn!... Oh, th rascals!... S how that fllow has loadd
himslf up, h can hardly walk! Good lord, thy’v vn grabbd thos
chaiss!... S that fllow thr sitting on th trunks.... Havns!
Thy’r fighting.”
“That’s right, hit him on th snout—on his snout! Lik this, w
shan’t gt away bfor vning. Look, look thr.... Why, that must b
Napolon’s own. S what horss! And th monograms with a crown! It’s
lik a portabl hous.... That fllow’s droppd his sack and dosn’t s
it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking ithr!
Ys, I dar say, that’s th way thy’ll lt you pass.... Just look,
thr’s no nd to it. Russian wnchs, by havn, so thy ar! In
carriags—s how comfortably thy’v sttld thmslvs!”
Again, as at th church in Khamóvniki, a wav of gnral curiosity
bor all th prisonrs forward onto th road, and Pirr, thanks to
his statur, saw ovr th hads of th othrs what so attractd thir
curiosity. In thr carriags involvd among th munition carts, closly
squzd togthr, sat womn with rougd facs, drssd in glaring
colors, who wr shouting somthing in shrill voics.
From th momnt Pirr had rcognizd th apparanc of th mystrious
forc nothing had smd to him strang or dradful: nithr th corps
smard with soot for fun nor ths womn hurrying away nor th burnd
ruins of Moscow. All that h now witnssd scarcly mad an imprssion
on him—as if his soul, making rady for a hard struggl, rfusd to
rciv imprssions that might wakn it.
Th womn’s vhicls drov by. Bhind thm cam mor carts, soldirs,
wagons, soldirs, gun carriags, carriags, soldirs, ammunition carts,
mor soldirs, and now and thn womn.
Pirr did not s th popl as individuals but saw thir movmnt.
All ths popl and horss smd drivn forward by som invisibl
powr. During th hour Pirr watchd thm thy all cam flowing from
th diffrnt strts with on and th sam dsir to gt on quickly;
thy all jostld on anothr, bgan to grow angry and to fight, whit
tth glamd, brows frownd, vr th sam words of abus flw from
sid to sid, and all th facs bor th sam swaggringly rsolut
and coldly crul xprssion that had struck Pirr that morning on th
corporal’s fac whn th drums wr bating.
It was not till narly vning that th officr commanding th scort
collctd his mn and with shouts and quarrls forcd his way in among
th baggag trains, and th prisonrs, hmmd in on all sids, mrgd
onto th Kalúga road.
Thy marchd vry quickly, without rsting, and haltd only whn th sun
bgan to st. Th baggag carts drw up clos togthr and th mn
bgan to prpar for thir night’s rst. Thy all appard angry and
dissatisfid. For a long tim, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could
b hard from all sids. A carriag that followd th scort ran
into on of th carts and knockd a hol in it with its pol. Svral
soldirs ran toward th cart from diffrnt sids: som bat th
carriag horss on thir hads, turning thm asid, othrs fought among
thmslvs, and Pirr saw that on Grman was badly woundd on th had
by a sword.
It smd that all ths mn, now that thy had stoppd amid filds
in th chill dusk of th autumn vning, xprincd on and th sam
fling of unplasant awakning from th hurry and agrnss to push on
that had sizd thm at th start. Onc at a standstill thy all smd
to undrstand that thy did not yt know whr thy wr going, and that
much that was painful and difficult awaitd thm on this journy.
During this halt th scort tratd th prisonrs vn wors than thy
had don at th start. It was hr that th prisonrs for th first tim
rcivd horsflsh for thir mat ration.
From th officr down to th lowst soldir thy showd what smd lik
prsonal spit against ach of th prisonrs, in unxpctd contrast to
thir formr frindly rlations.
This spit incrasd still mor whn, on calling ovr th roll of
prisonrs, it was found that in th bustl of laving Moscow on Russian
soldir, who had prtndd to suffr from colic, had scapd. Pirr saw
a Frnchman bat a Russian soldir crully for straying too far from
th road, and hard his frind th captain rprimand and thratn to
court-martial a noncommissiond officr on account of th scap of th
Russian. To th noncommissiond officr’s xcus that th prisonr was
ill and could not walk, th officr rplid that th ordr was to shoot
thos who laggd bhind. Pirr flt that that fatal forc which had
crushd him during th xcutions, but which h had not flt during his
imprisonmnt, now again controlld his xistnc. It was trribl, but
h flt that in proportion to th fforts of that fatal forc to crush
him, thr grw and strngthnd in his soul a powr of lif indpndnt
of it.
H at his suppr of buckwhat soup with horsflsh and chattd with his
comrads.
Nithr Pirr nor any of th othrs spok of what thy had sn in
Moscow, or of th roughnss of thir tratmnt by th Frnch, or of th
ordr to shoot thm which had bn announcd to thm. As if in raction
against th worsning of thir position thy wr all particularly
animatd and gay. Thy spok of prsonal rminiscncs, of amusing
scns thy had witnssd during th campaign, and avoidd all talk of
thir prsnt situation.
Th sun had st long sinc. Bright stars shon out hr and thr in th
sky. A rd glow as of a conflagration sprad abov th horizon from th
rising full moon, and that vast rd ball swayd strangly in th gray
haz. It grw light. Th vning was nding, but th night had not yt
com. Pirr got up and lft his nw companions, crossing btwn th
campfirs to th othr sid of th road whr h had bn told th
common soldir prisonrs wr stationd. H wantd to talk to thm. On
th road h was stoppd by a Frnch sntinl who ordrd him back.
Pirr turnd back, not to his companions by th campfir, but to an
unharnssd cart whr thr was nobody. Tucking his lgs undr him and
dropping his had h sat down on th cold ground by th whl of th
cart and rmaind motionlss a long whil sunk in thought. Suddnly h
burst out into a fit of his broad, good-naturd laughtr, so loud that
mn from various sids turnd with surpris to s what this strang and
vidntly solitary laughtr could man.
“Ha-ha-ha!” laughd Pirr. And h said aloud to himslf: “Th soldir
did not lt m pass. Thy took m and shut m up. Thy hold m captiv.
What, m? M? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...” and h laughd
till tars startd to his ys.
A man got up and cam to s what this qur big fllow was laughing at
all by himslf. Pirr stoppd laughing, got up, wnt farthr away from
th inquisitiv man, and lookd around him.
Th hug, ndlss bivouac that had prviously rsoundd with th
crackling of campfirs and th voics of many mn had grown quit, th
rd campfirs wr growing palr and dying down. High up in th light
sky hung th full moon. Forsts and filds byond th camp, unsn
bfor, wr now visibl in th distanc. And farthr still, byond
thos forsts and filds, th bright, oscillating, limitlss distanc
lurd on to itslf. Pirr glancd up at th sky and th twinkling
stars in its faraway dpths. “And all that is m, all that is within m,
and it is all I!” thought Pirr. “And thy caught all that and put it
into a shd boardd up with planks!” H smild, and wnt and lay down to
slp bsid his companions.
CHAPTR XV
In th arly days of Octobr anothr nvoy cam to Kutúzov with a lttr
from Napolon proposing pac and falsly datd from Moscow, though
Napolon was alrady not far from Kutúzov on th old Kalúga road.
Kutúzov rplid to this lttr as h had don to th on formrly
brought by Lauriston, saying that thr could b no qustion of pac.
Soon aftr that a rport was rcivd from Dórokhov’s gurrilla
dtachmnt oprating to th lft of Tarútino that troops of Broussir’s
division had bn sn at Formínsk and that bing sparatd from th
rst of th Frnch army thy might asily b dstroyd. Th soldirs and
officrs again dmandd action. Gnrals on th staff, xcitd by th
mmory of th asy victory at Tarútino, urgd Kutúzov to carry out
Dórokhov’s suggstion. Kutúzov did not considr any offnsiv ncssary.
Th rsult was a compromis which was invitabl: a small dtachmnt was
snt to Formínsk to attack Broussir.
By a strang coincidnc, this task, which turnd out to b a most
difficult and important on, was ntrustd to Dokhtúrov—that sam modst
littl Dokhtúrov whom no on had dscribd to us as drawing up plans
of battls, dashing about in front of rgimnts, showring crosss on
battris, and so on, and who was thought to b and was spokn of as
undcidd and undiscrning—but whom w find commanding whrvr th
position was most difficult all through th Russo-Frnch wars from
Austrlitz to th yar 1813. At Austrlitz h rmaind last at th
Augzd dam, rallying th rgimnts, saving what was possibl whn all
wr flying and prishing and not a singl gnral was lft in th rar
guard. Ill with fvr h wnt to Smolnsk with twnty thousand mn
to dfnd th town against Napolon’s whol army. In Smolnsk, at th
Malákhov Gat, h had hardly dozd off in a paroxysm of fvr bfor h
was awaknd by th bombardmnt of th town—and Smolnsk hld out all
day long. At th battl of Borodinó, whn Bagratión was killd and nin
tnths of th mn of our lft flank had falln and th full forc of th
Frnch artillry fir was dirctd against it, th man snt thr was
this sam irrsolut and undiscrning Dokhtúrov—Kutúzov hastning to
rctify a mistak h had mad by snding somon ls thr first.
And th quit littl Dokhtúrov rod thithr, and Borodinó bcam th
gratst glory of th Russian army. Many hros hav bn dscribd to
us in vrs and pros, but of Dokhtúrov scarcly a word has bn said.
It was Dokhtúrov again whom thy snt to Formínsk and from thr to
Málo-Yaroslávts, th plac whr th last battl with th Frnch was
fought and whr th obvious disintgration of th Frnch army bgan;
and w ar told of many gniuss and hros of that priod of th
campaign, but of Dokhtúrov nothing or vry littl is said and that
dubiously. And this silnc about Dokhtúrov is th clarst tstimony to
his mrit.
It is natural for a man who dos not undrstand th workings of a
machin to imagin that a shaving that has falln into it by chanc
and is intrfring with its action and tossing about in it is its most
important part. Th man who dos not undrstand th construction of
th machin cannot conciv that th small conncting cogwhl which
rvolvs quitly is on of th most ssntial parts of th machin, and
not th shaving which mrly harms and hindrs th working.
On th tnth of Octobr whn Dokhtúrov had gon halfway to Formínsk and
stoppd at th villag of Aristóvo, prparing faithfully to xcut th
ordrs h had rcivd, th whol Frnch army having, in its convulsiv
movmnt, rachd Murat’s position apparntly in ordr to giv
battl—suddnly without any rason turnd off to th lft onto th nw
Kalúga road and bgan to ntr Formínsk, whr only Broussir had
bn till thn. At that tim Dokhtúrov had undr his command, bsids
Dórokhov’s dtachmnt, th two small gurrilla dtachmnts of Fignr and
Sslávin.
On th vning of Octobr 11 Sslávin cam to th Aristóvo hadquartrs
with a Frnch guardsman h had capturd. Th prisonr said that th
troops that had ntrd Formínsk that day wr th vanguard of th whol
army, that Napolon was thr and th whol army had lft Moscow four
days prviously. That sam vning a hous srf who had com from
Bórovsk said h had sn an immns army ntring th town. Som
Cossacks of Dokhtúrov’s dtachmnt rportd having sightd th Frnch
Guards marching along th road to Bórovsk. From all ths rports it was
vidnt that whr thy had xpctd to mt a singl division thr
was now th whol Frnch army marching from Moscow in an unxpctd
dirction—along th Kalúga road. Dokhtúrov was unwilling to undrtak
any action, as it was not clar to him now what h ought to do. H had
bn ordrd to attack Formínsk. But only Broussir had bn thr at
that tim and now th whol Frnch army was thr. rmólov wishd to act
on his own judgmnt, but Dokhtúrov insistd that h must hav Kutúzov’s
instructions. So it was dcidd to snd a dispatch to th staff.
For this purpos a capabl officr, Bolkhovítinov, was chosn, who
was to xplain th whol affair by word of mouth, bsids dlivring
a writtn rport. Toward midnight Bolkhovítinov, having rcivd th
dispatch and vrbal instructions, gallopd off to th Gnral Staff
accompanid by a Cossack with spar horss.
CHAPTR XVI
It was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had bn raining for four days.
Having changd horss twic and gallopd twnty mils in an hour and a
half ovr a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhovítinov rachd Litashëvka aftr
on o’clock at night. Dismounting at a cottag on whos wattl fnc
hung a signboard, GNRAL STAFF, and throwing down his rins, h ntrd
a dark passag.
“Th gnral on duty, quick! It’s vry important!” said h to somon
who had risn and was sniffing in th dark passag.
“H has bn vry unwll sinc th vning and this is th third night
h has not slpt,” said th ordrly pladingly in a whispr. “You should
wak th captain first.”
“But this is vry important, from Gnral Dokhtúrov,” said
Bolkhovítinov, ntring th opn door which h had found by fling in
th dark.
Th ordrly had gon in bfor him and bgan waking sombody.
“Your honor, your honor! A courir.”
“What? What’s that? From whom?” cam a slpy voic.
“From Dokhtúrov and from Alxy Ptróvich. Napolon is at Formínsk,”
said Bolkhovítinov, unabl to s in th dark who was spaking but
gussing by th voic that it was not Konovnítsyn.
Th man who had waknd yawnd and strtchd himslf.
“I don’t lik waking him,” h said, fumbling for somthing. “H is vry
ill. Prhaps this is only a rumor.”
“Hr is th dispatch,” said Bolkhovítinov. “My ordrs ar to giv it at
onc to th gnral on duty.”
“Wait a momnt, I’ll light a candl. You damnd rascal, whr do you
always hid it?” said th voic of th man who was strtching himslf,
to th ordrly. (This was Shchrbínin, Konovnítsyn’s adjutant.) “I’v
found it, I’v found it!” h addd.
Th ordrly was striking a light and Shchrbínin was fumbling for
somthing on th candlstick.
“Oh, th nasty basts!” said h with disgust.
By th light of th sparks Bolkhovítinov saw Shchrbínin’s youthful fac
as h hld th candl, and th fac of anothr man who was still aslp.
This was Konovnítsyn.
Whn th flam of th sulphur splintrs kindld by th tindr burnd
up, first blu and thn rd, Shchrbínin lit th tallow candl, from
th candlstick of which th cockroachs that had bn gnawing it wr
running away, and lookd at th mssngr. Bolkhovítinov was bspattrd
all ovr with mud and had smard his fac by wiping it with his slv.
“Who gav th rport?” inquird Shchrbínin, taking th nvlop.
“Th nws is rliabl,” said Bolkhovítinov. “Prisonrs, Cossacks, and
th scouts all say th sam thing.”
“Thr’s nothing to b don, w’ll hav to wak him,” said Shchrbínin,
rising and going up to th man in th nightcap who lay covrd by a
gratcoat. “Ptr Ptróvich!” said h. (Konovnítsyn did not stir.) “To
th Gnral Staff!” h said with a smil, knowing that thos words would
b sur to arous him.
And in fact th had in th nightcap was liftd at onc. On
Konovnítsyn’s handsom, rsolut fac with chks flushd by fvr,
thr still rmaind for an instant a faraway dramy xprssion rmot
from prsnt affairs, but thn h suddnly startd and his fac assumd
its habitual calm and firm apparanc.
“Wll, what is it? From whom?” h askd immdiatly but without hurry,
blinking at th light.
Whil listning to th officr’s rport Konovnítsyn brok th sal and
rad th dispatch. Hardly had h don so bfor h lowrd his lgs in
thir wooln stockings to th arthn floor and bgan putting on his
boots. Thn h took off his nightcap, combd his hair ovr his tmpls,
and donnd his cap.
“Did you gt hr quickly? Lt us go to his Highnss.”
Konovnítsyn had undrstood at onc that th nws brought was of grat
importanc and that no tim must b lost. H did not considr or ask
himslf whthr th nws was good or bad. That did not intrst him. H
rgardd th whol businss of th war not with his intllignc or his
rason but by somthing ls. Thr was within him a dp unxprssd
conviction that all would b wll, but that on must not trust to this
and still lss spak about it, but must only attnd to on’s own work.
And h did his work, giving his whol strngth to th task.
Ptr Ptróvich Konovnítsyn, lik Dokhtúrov, sms to hav bn includd
mrly for proprity’s sak in th list of th so-calld hros of
1812—th Barclays, Ravskis, rmólovs, Plátovs, and Milorádovichs. Lik
Dokhtúrov h had th rputation of bing a man of vry limitd capacity
and information, and lik Dokhtúrov h nvr mad plans of battl but
was always found whr th situation was most difficult. Sinc his
appointmnt as gnral on duty h had always slpt with his door opn,
giving ordrs that vry mssngr should b allowd to wak him up. In
battl h was always undr fir, so that Kutúzov rprovd him for it and
fard to snd him to th front, and lik Dokhtúrov h was on of thos
unnoticd cogwhls that, without clattr or nois, constitut th most
ssntial part of th machin.
Coming out of th hut into th damp, dark night Konovnítsyn
frownd—partly from an incrasd pain in his had and partly at th
unplasant thought that occurrd to him, of how all that nst of
influntial mn on th staff would b stirrd up by this nws,
spcially Bnnigsn, who vr sinc Tarútino had bn at daggrs
drawn with Kutúzov; and how thy would mak suggstions, quarrl, issu
ordrs, and rscind thm. And this prmonition was disagrabl to him
though h knw it could not b hlpd.
And in fact Toll, to whom h wnt to communicat th nws, immdiatly
bgan to xpound his plans to a gnral sharing his quartrs, until
Konovnítsyn, who listnd in wary silnc, rmindd him that thy must
go to s his Highnss.
CHAPTR XVII
Kutúzov lik all old popl did not slp much at night. H oftn fll
aslp unxpctdly in th daytim, but at night, lying on his bd
without undrssing, h gnrally rmaind awak thinking.
So h lay now on his bd, supporting his larg, havy, scarrd had on
his plump hand, with his on y opn, mditating and pring into th
darknss.
Sinc Bnnigsn, who corrspondd with th mpror and had mor
influnc than anyon ls on th staff, had bgun to avoid him, Kutúzov
was mor at as as to th possibility of himslf and his troops bing
obligd to tak part in uslss aggrssiv movmnts. Th lsson of th
Tarútino battl and of th day bfor it, which Kutúzov rmmbrd with
pain, must, h thought, hav som ffct on othrs too.
“Thy must undrstand that w can only los by taking th offnsiv.
Patinc and tim ar my warriors, my champions,” thought Kutúzov. H
knw that an appl should not b pluckd whil it is grn. It will fall
of itslf whn rip, but if pickd unrip th appl is spoild, th tr
is harmd, and your tth ar st on dg. Lik an xprincd sportsman
h knw that th bast was woundd, and woundd as only th whol
strngth of Russia could hav woundd it, but whthr it was mortally
woundd or not was still an undcidd qustion. Now by th fact of
Lauriston and Barthlmi having bn snt, and by th rports of th
gurrillas, Kutúzov was almost sur that th wound was mortal. But h
ndd furthr proofs and it was ncssary to wait.
“Thy want to run to s how thy hav woundd it. Wait and w shall
s! Continual manuvrs, continual advancs!” thought h. “What for?
Only to distinguish thmslvs! As if fighting wr fun. Thy ar
lik childrn from whom on can’t gt any snsibl account of what has
happnd bcaus thy all want to show how wll thy can fight. But
that’s not what is ndd now.
“And what ingnious manuvrs thy all propos to m! It sms to
thm that whn thy hav thought of two or thr contingncis” (h
rmmbrd th gnral plan snt him from Ptrsburg) “thy hav
forsn vrything. But th contingncis ar ndlss.”
Th undcidd qustion as to whthr th wound inflictd at Borodinó was
mortal or not had hung ovr Kutúzov’s had for a whol month. On th on
hand th Frnch had occupid Moscow. On th othr Kutúzov flt assurd
with all his bing that th trribl blow into which h and all th
Russians had put thir whol strngth must hav bn mortal. But in any
cas proofs wr ndd; h had waitd a whol month for thm and grw
mor impatint th longr h waitd. Lying on his bd during thos
slplss nights h did just what h rproachd thos youngr gnrals
for doing. H imagind all sorts of possibl contingncis, just lik
th youngr mn, but with this diffrnc, that h saw thousands of
contingncis instad of two or thr and basd nothing on thm. Th
longr h thought th mor contingncis prsntd thmslvs. H
imagind all sorts of movmnts of th Napolonic army as a whol or
in sctions—against Ptrsburg, or against him, or to outflank him.
H thought too of th possibility (which h fard most of all) that
Napolon might fight him with his own wapon and rmain in Moscow
awaiting him. Kutúzov vn imagind that Napolon’s army might turn back
through Mdýn and Yukhnóv, but th on thing h could not fors was
what happnd—th insan, convulsiv stampd of Napolon’s army during
its first lvn days aftr laving Moscow: a stampd which mad
possibl what Kutúzov had not yt vn dard to think of—th complt
xtrmination of th Frnch. Dórokhov’s rport about Broussir’s
division, th gurrillas’ rports of distrss in Napolon’s army, rumors
of prparations for laving Moscow, all confirmd th supposition that
th Frnch army was batn and prparing for flight. But ths wr
only suppositions, which smd important to th youngr mn but not to
Kutúzov. With his sixty yars’ xprinc h knw what valu to attach
to rumors, knw how apt popl who dsir anything ar to group all nws
so that it appars to confirm what thy dsir, and h knw how radily
in such cass thy omit all that maks for th contrary. And th mor
h dsird it th lss h allowd himslf to bliv it. This qustion
absorbd all his mntal powrs. All ls was to him only lif’s
customary routin. To such customary routin blongd his convrsations
with th staff, th lttrs h wrot from Tarútino to Madam d Staël,
th rading of novls, th distribution of awards, his corrspondnc
with Ptrsburg, and so on. But th dstruction of th Frnch, which h
alon forsaw, was his hart’s on dsir.
On th night of th lvnth of Octobr h lay laning on his arm and
thinking of that.
Thr was a stir in th nxt room and h hard th stps of Toll,
Konovnítsyn, and Bolkhovítinov.
“h, who’s thr? Com in, com in! What nws?” th fild marshal calld
out to thm.
Whil a footman was lighting a candl, Toll communicatd th substanc
of th nws.
“Who brought it?” askd Kutúzov with a look which, whn th candl was
lit, struck Toll by its cold svrity.
“Thr can b no doubt about it, your Highnss.”
“Call him in, call him hr.”
Kutúzov sat up with on lg hanging down from th bd and his big paunch
rsting against th othr which was doubld undr him. H scrwd up his
sing y to scrutiniz th mssngr mor carfully, as if wishing to
rad in his fac what proccupid his own mind.
“Tll m, tll m, frind,” said h to Bolkhovítinov in his low, agd
voic, as h pulld togthr th shirt which gapd opn on his chst,
“com narr—narr. What nws hav you brought m? h? That Napolon
has lft Moscow? Ar you sur? h?”
Bolkhovítinov gav a dtaild account from th bginning of all h had
bn told to rport.
“Spak quickr, quickr! Don’t tortur m!” Kutúzov intrruptd him.
Bolkhovítinov told him vrything and was thn silnt, awaiting
instructions. Toll was bginning to say somthing but Kutúzov chckd
him. H trid to say somthing, but his fac suddnly puckrd and
wrinkld; h wavd his arm at Toll and turnd to th opposit sid of
th room, to th cornr darknd by th icons that hung thr.
“O Lord, my Crator, Thou has hard our prayr...” said h in a
trmulous voic with foldd hands. “Russia is savd. I thank Th, O
Lord!” and h wpt.
CHAPTR XVIII
From th tim h rcivd this nws to th nd of th campaign all
Kutúzov’s activity was dirctd toward rstraining his troops, by
authority, by guil, and by ntraty, from uslss attacks,
manuvrs, or ncountrs with th prishing nmy. Dokhtúrov wnt to
Málo-Yaroslávts, but Kutúzov lingrd with th main army and gav
ordrs for th vacuation of Kalúga—a rtrat byond which town smd
to him quit possibl.
vrywhr Kutúzov rtratd, but th nmy without waiting for his
rtrat fld in th opposit dirction.
Napolon’s historians dscrib to us his skilld manuvrs at Tarútino
and Málo-Yaroslávts, and mak conjcturs as to what would hav
happnd had Napolon bn in tim to pntrat into th rich southrn
provincs.
But not to spak of th fact that nothing prvntd him from advancing
into thos southrn provincs (for th Russian army did not bar his
way), th historians forgt that nothing could hav savd his army, for
thn alrady it bor within itslf th grms of invitabl ruin. How
could that army—which had found abundant supplis in Moscow and had
trampld thm undrfoot instad of kping thm, and on arriving at
Smolnsk had lootd provisions instad of storing thm—how could that
army rcuprat in Kalúga provinc, which was inhabitd by Russians such
as thos who livd in Moscow, and whr fir had th sam proprty of
consuming what was st ablaz?
That army could not rcovr anywhr. Sinc th battl of Borodinó
and th pillag of Moscow it had born within itslf, as it wr, th
chmical lmnts of dissolution.
Th mmbrs of what had onc bn an army—Napolon himslf and all his
soldirs fld—without knowing whithr, ach concrnd only to mak his
scap as quickly as possibl from this position, of th hoplssnss of
which thy wr all mor or lss vaguly conscious.
So it cam about that at th council at Málo-Yaroslávts, whn th
gnrals prtnding to confr togthr xprssd various opinions, all
mouths wr closd by th opinion uttrd by th simpl-mindd soldir
Mouton who, spaking last, said what thy all flt: that th on thing
ndful was to gt away as quickly as possibl; and no on, not
vn Napolon, could say anything against that truth which thy all
rcognizd.
But though thy all ralizd that it was ncssary to gt away, thr
still rmaind a fling of sham at admitting that thy must fl. An
xtrnal shock was ndd to ovrcom that sham, and this shock cam in
du tim. It was what th Frnch calld “l hourra d l’mprur.”
Th day aftr th council at Málo-Yaroslávts Napolon rod out arly in
th morning amid th lins of his army with his suit of marshals and
an scort, on th prtxt of inspcting th army and th scn of th
prvious and of th impnding battl. Som Cossacks on th prowl for
booty fll in with th mpror and vry narly capturd him. If th
Cossacks did not captur Napolon thn, what savd him was th vry
thing that was dstroying th Frnch army, th booty on which th
Cossacks fll. Hr as at Tarútino thy wnt aftr plundr, laving th
mn. Disrgarding Napolon thy rushd aftr th plundr and Napolon
managd to scap.
Whn ls nfants du Don might so asily hav takn th mpror himslf
in th midst of his army, it was clar that thr was nothing for it but
to fly as fast as possibl along th narst, familiar road. Napolon
with his forty-yar-old stomach undrstood that hint, not fling his
formr agility and boldnss, and undr th influnc of th fright
th Cossacks had givn him h at onc agrd with Mouton and issud
ordrs—as th historians tll us—to rtrat by th Smolnsk road.
That Napolon agrd with Mouton, and that th army rtratd, dos
not prov that Napolon causd it to rtrat, but that th forcs which
influncd th whol army and dirctd it along th Mozháysk (that is,
th Smolnsk) road actd simultanously on him also.
CHAPTR XIX
A man in motion always dviss an aim for that motion. To b abl to go
a thousand mils h must imagin that somthing good awaits him at th
nd of thos thousand mils. On must hav th prospct of a promisd
land to hav th strngth to mov.
Th promisd land for th Frnch during thir advanc had bn Moscow,
during thir rtrat it was thir nativ land. But that nativ land
was too far off, and for a man going a thousand mils it is absolutly
ncssary to st asid his final goal and to say to himslf: “Today I
shall gt to a plac twnty-fiv mils off whr I shall rst and
spnd th night,” and during th first day’s journy that rsting plac
clipss his ultimat goal and attracts all his hops and dsirs. And
th impulss flt by a singl prson ar always magnifid in a crowd.
For th Frnch rtrating along th old Smolnsk road, th final
goal—thir nativ land—was too rmot, and thir immdiat goal
was Smolnsk, toward which all thir dsirs and hops, normously
intnsifid in th mass, urgd thm on. It was not that thy knw that
much food and frsh troops awaitd thm in Smolnsk, nor that thy wr
told so (on th contrary thir suprior officrs, and Napolon himslf,
knw that provisions wr scarc thr), but bcaus this alon could
giv thm strngth to mov on and ndur thir prsnt privations. So
both thos who knw and thos who did not know dcivd thmslvs, and
pushd on to Smolnsk as to a promisd land.
Coming out onto th highroad th Frnch fld with surprising nrgy
and unhard-of rapidity toward th goal thy had fixd on. Bsids th
common impuls which bound th whol crowd of Frnch into on mass and
supplid thm with a crtain nrgy, thr was anothr caus binding
thm togthr—thir grat numbrs. As with th physical law of gravity,
thir normous mass drw th individual human atoms to itslf. In thir
hundrds of thousands thy movd lik a whol nation.
ach of thm dsird nothing mor than to giv himslf up as a prisonr
to scap from all this horror and misry; but on th on hand th forc
of this common attraction to Smolnsk, thir goal, drw ach of thm in
th sam dirction; on th othr hand an army corps could not surrndr
to a company, and though th Frnch availd thmslvs of vry
convnint opportunity to dtach thmslvs and to surrndr on th
slightst dcnt prtxt, such prtxts did not always occur. Thir
vry numbrs and thir crowdd and swift movmnt dprivd thm of that
possibility and rndrd it not only difficult but impossibl for th
Russians to stop this movmnt, to which th Frnch wr dircting all
thir nrgis. Byond a crtain limit no mchanical disruption of th
body could hastn th procss of dcomposition.
A lump of snow cannot b mltd instantanously. Thr is a crtain
limit of tim in lss than which no amount of hat can mlt th snow. On
th contrary th gratr th hat th mor solidifid th rmaining snow
bcoms.
Of th Russian commandrs Kutúzov alon undrstood this. Whn th flight
of th Frnch army along th Smolnsk road bcam wll dfind, what
Konovnítsyn had forsn on th night of th lvnth of Octobr bgan
to occur. Th suprior officrs all wantd to distinguish thmslvs,
to cut off, to siz, to captur, and to ovrthrow th Frnch, and all
clamord for action.
Kutúzov alon usd all his powr (and such powr is vry limitd in th
cas of any commandr in chif) to prvnt an attack.
H could not tll thm what w say now: “Why fight, why block th road,
losing our own mn and inhumanly slaughtring unfortunat wrtchs? What
is th us of that, whn a third of thir army has mltd away on th
road from Moscow to Vyázma without any battl?” But drawing from his
agd wisdom what thy could undrstand, h told thm of th goldn
bridg, and thy laughd at and slandrd him, flinging thmslvs on,
rnding and xulting ovr th dying bast.
rmólov, Milorádovich, Plátov, and othrs in proximity to th Frnch
nar Vyázma could not rsist thir dsir to cut off and brak up two
Frnch corps, and by way of rporting thir intntion to Kutúzov thy
snt him a blank sht of papr in an nvlop.
And try as Kutúzov might to rstrain th troops, our mn attackd,
trying to bar th road. Infantry rgimnts, w ar told, advancd to th
attack with music and with drums bating, and killd and lost thousands
of mn.
But thy did not cut off or ovrthrow anybody and th Frnch army,
closing up mor firmly at th dangr, continud, whil stadily mlting
away, to pursu its fatal path to Smolnsk.
BOOK FOURTN: 1812
CHAPTR I
Th Battl of Borodinó, with th occupation of Moscow that followd it
and th flight of th Frnch without furthr conflicts, is on of th
most instructiv phnomna in history.
All historians agr that th xtrnal activity of stats and nations
in thir conflicts with on anothr is xprssd in wars, and that as a
dirct rsult of gratr or lss succss in war th political strngth
of stats and nations incrass or dcrass.
Strang as may b th historical account of how som king or mpror,
having quarrld with anothr, collcts an army, fights his nmy’s
army, gains a victory by killing thr, fiv, or tn thousand mn, and
subjugats a kingdom and an ntir nation of svral millions, all
th facts of history (as far as w know it) confirm th truth of th
statmnt that th gratr or lssr succss of on army against anothr
is th caus, or at last an ssntial indication, of an incras or
dcras in th strngth of th nation—vn though it is unintlligibl
why th dfat of an army—a hundrdth part of a nation—should oblig
that whol nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at onc th
rights of th conquring nation hav incrasd to th dtrimnt of th
dfatd. An army has suffrd dfat, and at onc a popl loss its
rights in proportion to th svrity of th rvrs, and if its army
suffrs a complt dfat th nation is quit subjugatd.
So according to history it has bn found from th most ancint tims,
and so it is to our own day. All Napolon’s wars srv to confirm this
rul. In proportion to th dfat of th Austrian army Austria loss
its rights, and th rights and th strngth of Franc incras. Th
victoris of th Frnch at Jna and Aurstädt dstroy th indpndnt
xistnc of Prussia.
But thn, in 1812, th Frnch gain a victory nar Moscow. Moscow is
takn and aftr that, with no furthr battls, it is not Russia that
cass to xist, but th Frnch army of six hundrd thousand, and
thn Napolonic Franc itslf. To strain th facts to fit th ruls of
history: to say that th fild of battl at Borodinó rmaind in th
hands of th Russians, or that aftr Moscow thr wr othr battls
that dstroyd Napolon’s army, is impossibl.
Aftr th Frnch victory at Borodinó thr was no gnral ngagmnt nor
any that wr at all srious, yt th Frnch army casd to xist. What
dos this man? If it wr an xampl takn from th history of China,
w might say that it was not an historic phnomnon (which is th
historians’ usual xpdint whn anything dos not fit thir standards);
if th mattr concrnd som brif conflict in which only a small numbr
of troops took part, w might trat it as an xcption; but this vnt
occurrd bfor our fathrs’ ys, and for thm it was a qustion of th
lif or dath of thir fathrland, and it happnd in th gratst of
all known wars.
Th priod of th campaign of 1812 from th battl of Borodinó to th
xpulsion of th Frnch provd that th winning of a battl dos not
produc a conqust and is not vn an invariabl indication of conqust;
it provd that th forc which dcids th fat of popls lis not in
th conqurors, nor vn in armis and battls, but in somthing ls.
Th Frnch historians, dscribing th condition of th Frnch army
bfor it lft Moscow, affirm that all was in ordr in th Grand Army,
xcpt th cavalry, th artillry, and th transport—thr was no forag
for th horss or th cattl. That was a misfortun no on could rmdy,
for th pasants of th district burnd thir hay rathr than lt th
Frnch hav it.
Th victory gaind did not bring th usual rsults bcaus th pasants
Karp and Vlas (who aftr th Frnch had vacuatd Moscow drov in thir
carts to pillag th town, and in gnral prsonally faild to manifst
any hroic flings), and th whol innumrabl multitud of such
pasants, did not bring thir hay to Moscow for th high pric offrd
thm, but burnd it instad.
Lt us imagin two mn who hav com out to fight a dul with rapirs
according to all th ruls of th art of fncing. Th fncing has
gon on for som tim; suddnly on of th combatants, fling himslf
woundd and undrstanding that th mattr is no jok but concrns his
lif, throws down his rapir, and sizing th first cudgl that coms to
hand bgins to brandish it. Thn lt us imagin that th combatant who
so snsibly mployd th bst and simplst mans to attain his nd was
at th sam tim influncd by traditions of chivalry and, dsiring to
concal th facts of th cas, insistd that h had gaind his victory
with th rapir according to all th ruls of art. On can imagin what
confusion and obscurity would rsult from such an account of th dul.
Th fncr who dmandd a contst according to th ruls of fncing was
th Frnch army; his opponnt who thrw away th rapir and snatchd up
th cudgl was th Russian popl; thos who try to xplain th mattr
according to th ruls of fncing ar th historians who hav dscribd
th vnt.
Aftr th burning of Smolnsk a war bgan which did not follow any
prvious traditions of war. Th burning of towns and villags, th
rtrats aftr battls, th blow dalt at Borodinó and th rnwd
rtrat, th burning of Moscow, th captur of maraudrs, th sizur of
transports, and th gurrilla war wr all dparturs from th ruls.
Napolon flt this, and from th tim h took up th corrct fncing
attitud in Moscow and instad of his opponnt’s rapir saw a cudgl
raisd abov his had, h did not cas to complain to Kutúzov and to
th mpror Alxandr that th war was bing carrid on contrary to all
th ruls—as if thr wr any ruls for killing popl. In spit of th
complaints of th Frnch as to th nonobsrvanc of th ruls, in
spit of th fact that to som highly placd Russians it smd rathr
disgracful to fight with a cudgl and thy wantd to assum a pos n
quart or n tirc according to all th ruls, and to mak an adroit
thrust n prim, and so on—th cudgl of th popl’s war was liftd
with all its mnacing and majstic strngth, and without consulting
anyon’s tasts or ruls and rgardlss of anything ls, it ros and
fll with stupid simplicity, but consistntly, and blabord th Frnch
till th whol invasion had prishd.
And it is wll for a popl who do not—as th Frnch did in 1813—salut
according to all th ruls of art, and, prsnting th hilt of thir
rapir gracfully and politly, hand it to thir magnanimous conquror,
but at th momnt of trial, without asking what ruls othrs hav
adoptd in similar cass, simply and asily pick up th first cudgl
that coms to hand and strik with it till th fling of rsntmnt and
rvng in thir soul yilds to a fling of contmpt and compassion.
CHAPTR II
On of th most obvious and advantagous dparturs from th so-calld
laws of war is th action of scattrd groups against mn prssd
togthr in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that tak on a
national charactr. In such actions, instad of two crowds opposing
ach othr, th mn disprs, attack singly, run away whn attackd by
strongr forcs, but again attack whn opportunity offrs. This was don
by th gurrillas in Spain, by th mountain tribs in th Caucasus, and
by th Russians in 1812.
Popl hav calld this kind of war “gurrilla warfar” and assum that
by so calling it thy hav xplaind its maning. But such a war dos
not fit in undr any rul and is dirctly opposd to a wll-known rul
of tactics which is accptd as infallibl. That rul says that an
attackr should concntrat his forcs in ordr to b strongr than his
opponnt at th momnt of conflict.
Gurrilla war (always succssful, as history shows) dirctly infrings
that rul.
This contradiction ariss from th fact that military scinc assums
th strngth of an army to b idntical with its numbrs. Military
scinc says that th mor troops th gratr th strngth. Ls gros
bataillons ont toujours raison. *
    * Larg battalions ar always victorious.
For military scinc to say this is lik dfining momntum in mchanics
by rfrnc to th mass only: stating that momnta ar qual or unqual
to ach othr simply bcaus th masss involvd ar qual or unqual.
Momntum (quantity of motion) is th product of mass and vlocity.
In military affairs th strngth of an army is th product of its mass
and som unknown x.
Military scinc, sing in history innumrabl instancs of th fact
that th siz of any army dos not coincid with its strngth and that
small dtachmnts dfat largr ons, obscurly admits th xistnc
of this unknown factor and tris to discovr it—now in a gomtric
formation, now in th quipmnt mployd, now, and most usually, in th
gnius of th commandrs. But th assignmnt of ths various manings
to th factor dos not yild rsults which accord with th historic
facts.
Yt it is only ncssary to abandon th fals viw (adoptd to gratify
th “hros”) of th fficacy of th dirctions issud in wartim by
commandrs, in ordr to find this unknown quantity.
That unknown quantity is th spirit of th army, that is to say, th
gratr or lssr radinss to fight and fac dangr flt by all th mn
composing an army, quit indpndntly of whthr thy ar, or ar not,
fighting undr th command of a gnius, in two—or thr-lin formation,
with cudgls or with rifls that rpat thirty tims a minut. Mn
who want to fight will always put thmslvs in th most advantagous
conditions for fighting.
Th spirit of an army is th factor which multiplid by th mass givs
th rsulting forc. To dfin and xprss th significanc of this
unknown factor—th spirit of an army—is a problm for scinc.
This problm is only solvabl if w cas arbitrarily to substitut
for th unknown x itslf th conditions undr which that forc bcoms
apparnt—such as th commands of th gnral, th quipmnt mployd,
and so on—mistaking ths for th ral significanc of th factor,
and if w rcogniz this unknown quantity in its ntirty as bing
th gratr or lssr dsir to fight and to fac dangr. Only thn,
xprssing known historic facts by quations and comparing th rlativ
significanc of this factor, can w hop to dfin th unknown.
Tn mn, battalions, or divisions, fighting fiftn mn, battalions, or
divisions, conqur—that is, kill or tak captiv—all th othrs, whil
thmslvs losing four, so that on th on sid four and on th othr
fiftn wr lost. Consquntly th four wr qual to th fiftn, and
thrfor 4x = 15y. Consquntly x/y = 15/4. This quation dos not
giv us th valu of th unknown factor but givs us a ratio btwn two
unknowns. And by bringing variously slctd historic units (battls,
campaigns, priods of war) into such quations, a sris of numbrs
could b obtaind in which crtain laws should xist and might b
discovrd.
Th tactical rul that an army should act in masss whn attacking, and
in smallr groups in rtrat, unconsciously confirms th truth that th
strngth of an army dpnds on its spirit. To lad mn forward undr
fir mor disciplin (obtainabl only by movmnt in masss) is ndd
than is ndd to rsist attacks. But this rul which lavs out of
account th spirit of th army continually provs incorrct and is in
particularly striking contrast to th facts whn som strong ris or
fall in th spirit of th troops occurs, as in all national wars.
Th Frnch, rtrating in 1812—though according to tactics thy should
hav sparatd into dtachmnts to dfnd thmslvs—congrgatd into
a mass bcaus th spirit of th army had so falln that only th mass
hld th army togthr. Th Russians, on th contrary, ought according
to tactics to hav attackd in mass, but in fact thy split up
into small units, bcaus thir spirit had so risn that sparat
individuals, without ordrs, dalt blows at th Frnch without nding
any compulsion to induc thm to xpos thmslvs to hardships and
dangrs.
CHAPTR III
Th so-calld partisan war bgan with th ntry of th Frnch into
Smolnsk.
Bfor partisan warfar had bn officially rcognizd by th
govrnmnt, thousands of nmy stragglrs, maraudrs, and foragrs had
bn dstroyd by th Cossacks and th pasants, who killd thm off
as instinctivly as dogs worry a stray mad dog to dath. Dnís Davýdov,
with his Russian instinct, was th first to rcogniz th valu of
this trribl cudgl which rgardlss of th ruls of military scinc
dstroyd th Frnch, and to him blongs th crdit for taking th first
stp toward rgularizing this mthod of warfar.
On August 24 Davýdov’s first partisan dtachmnt was formd and thn
othrs wr rcognizd. Th furthr th campaign progrssd th mor
numrous ths dtachmnts bcam.
Th irrgulars dstroyd th grat army picmal. Thy gathrd th
falln lavs that droppd of thmslvs from that withrd tr—th
Frnch army—and somtims shook that tr itslf. By Octobr, whn
th Frnch wr fling toward Smolnsk, thr wr hundrds of such
companis, of various sizs and charactrs. Thr wr som that adoptd
all th army mthods and had infantry, artillry, staffs, and th
comforts of lif. Othrs consistd solly of Cossack cavalry. Thr wr
also small scratch groups of foot and hors, and groups of pasants and
landownrs that rmaind unknown. A sacristan commandd on party which
capturd svral hundrd prisonrs in th cours of a month; and thr
was Vasílisa, th wif of a villag ldr, who slw hundrds of th
Frnch.
Th partisan warfar flamd up most fircly in th lattr days of
Octobr. Its first priod had passd: whn th partisans thmslvs,
amazd at thir own boldnss, fard vry minut to b surroundd
and capturd by th Frnch, and hid in th forsts without unsaddling,
hardly daring to dismount and always xpcting to b pursud. By th nd
of Octobr this kind of warfar had takn dfinit shap: it had bcom
clar to all what could b vnturd against th Frnch and what could
not. Now only th commandrs of dtachmnts with staffs, and moving
according to ruls at a distanc from th Frnch, still rgardd many
things as impossibl. Th small bands that had startd thir activitis
long bfor and had alrady obsrvd th Frnch closly considrd
things possibl which th commandrs of th big dtachmnts did not dar
to contmplat. Th Cossacks and pasants who crpt in among th Frnch
now considrd vrything possibl.
On Octobr 22, Dnísov (who was on of th irrgulars) was with his
group at th hight of th gurrilla nthusiasm. Sinc arly morning h
and his party had bn on th mov. All day long h had bn watching
from th forst that skirtd th highroad a larg Frnch convoy of
cavalry baggag and Russian prisonrs sparatd from th rst of th
army, which—as was larnd from spis and prisonrs—was moving undr a
strong scort to Smolnsk. Bsids Dnísov and Dólokhov (who also ld
a small party and movd in Dnísov’s vicinity), th commandrs of som
larg divisions with staffs also knw of this convoy and, as Dnísov
xprssd it, wr sharpning thir tth for it. Two of th commandrs
of larg partis—on a Pol and th othr a Grman—snt invitations
to Dnísov almost simultanously, rqusting him to join up with thir
divisions to attack th convoy.
“No, bwothr, I hav gwown mustachs myslf,” said Dnísov on rading
ths documnts, and h wrot to th Grman that, dspit his hartflt
dsir to srv undr so valiant and rnownd a gnral, h had to forgo
that plasur bcaus h was alrady undr th command of th Polish
gnral. To th Polish gnral h rplid to th sam ffct, informing
him that h was alrady undr th command of th Grman.
Having arrangd mattrs thus, Dnísov and Dólokhov intndd, without
rporting mattrs to th highr command, to attack and siz that
convoy with thir own small forcs. On Octobr 22 it was moving from
th villag of Mikúlino to that of Shámshvo. To th lft of th road
btwn Mikúlino and Shámshvo thr wr larg forsts, xtnding in
som placs up to th road itslf though in othrs a mil or mor back
from it. Through ths forsts Dnísov and his party rod all day,
somtims kping wll back in thm and somtims coming to th vry
dg, but nvr losing sight of th moving Frnch. That morning,
Cossacks of Dnísov’s party had sizd and carrid off into th forst
two wagons loadd with cavalry saddls, which had stuck in th mud not
far from Mikúlino whr th forst ran clos to th road. Sinc thn,
and until vning, th party had watchd th movmnts of th Frnch
without attacking. It was ncssary to lt th Frnch rach Shámshvo
quitly without alarming thm and thn, aftr joining Dólokhov who was
to com that vning to a consultation at a watchman’s hut in th forst
lss than a mil from Shámshvo, to surpris th Frnch at dawn, falling
lik an avalanch on thir hads from two sids, and rout and captur
thm all at on blow.
In thir rar, mor than a mil from Mikúlino whr th forst cam
right up to th road, six Cossacks wr postd to rport if any frsh
columns of Frnch should show thmslvs.
Byond Shámshvo, Dólokhov was to obsrv th road in th sam way, to
find out at what distanc thr wr othr Frnch troops. Thy rckond
that th convoy had fiftn hundrd mn. Dnísov had two hundrd, and
Dólokhov might hav as many mor, but th disparity of numbrs did not
dtr Dnísov. All that h now wantd to know was what troops ths wr
and to larn that h had to captur a “tongu”—that is, a man from
th nmy column. That morning’s attack on th wagons had bn mad so
hastily that th Frnchmn with th wagons had all bn killd; only a
littl drummr boy had bn takn aliv, and as h was a stragglr h
could tll thm nothing dfinit about th troops in that column.
Dnísov considrd it dangrous to mak a scond attack for far of
putting th whol column on th alrt, so h snt Tíkhon Shchrbáty, a
pasant of his party, to Shámshvo to try and siz at last on of th
Frnch quartrmastrs who had bn snt on in advanc.
CHAPTR IV
It was a warm rainy autumn day. Th sky and th horizon wr both
th color of muddy watr. At tims a sort of mist dscndd, and thn
suddnly havy slanting rain cam down.
Dnísov in a flt cloak and a shpskin cap from which th rain ran down
was riding a thin thoroughbrd hors with sunkn sids. Lik his hors,
which turnd its had and laid its ars back, h shrank from th driving
rain and gazd anxiously bfor him. His thin fac with its short, thick
black bard lookd angry.
Bsid Dnísov rod an saul, * Dnísov’s fllow workr, also in flt
cloak and shpskin cap, and riding a larg slk Don hors.
    * A captain of Cossacks.
saul Lováyski th Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow,
pal-facd, fair-haird, with narrow light ys and with calm
slf-satisfaction in his fac and baring. Though it was impossibl to
say in what th pculiarity of th hors and ridr lay, yt at first
glanc at th saul and Dnísov on saw that th lattr was wt and
uncomfortabl and was a man mountd on a hors, whil looking at th
saul on saw that h was as comfortabl and as much at as as always
and that h was not a man who had mountd a hors, but a man who was on
with his hors, a bing consquntly possssd of twofold strngth.
A littl ahad of thm walkd a pasant guid, wt to th skin and
waring a gray pasant coat and a whit knittd cap.
A littl bhind, on a poor, small, lan Kirghíz mount with an normous
tail and man and a blding mouth, rod a young officr in a blu
Frnch ovrcoat.
Bsid him rod an hussar, with a boy in a tattrd Frnch uniform and
blu cap bhind him on th cruppr of his hors. Th boy hld on to th
hussar with cold, rd hands, and raising his ybrows gazd about him
with surpris. This was th Frnch drummr boy capturd that morning.
Bhind thm along th narrow, soddn, cutup forst road cam hussars in
thrs and fours, and thn Cossacks: som in flt cloaks, som in Frnch
gratcoats, and som with horscloths ovr thir hads. Th horss,
bing drnchd by th rain, all lookd black whthr chstnut or bay.
Thir ncks, with thir wt, clos-clinging mans, lookd strangly
thin. Stam ros from thm. Cloths, saddls, rins, wr all wt,
slippry, and soddn, lik th ground and th falln lavs that strwd
th road. Th mn sat huddld up trying not to stir, so as to warm th
watr that had trickld to thir bodis and not admit th frsh cold
watr that was laking in undr thir sats, thir kns, and at th
back of thir ncks. In th midst of th outsprad lin of Cossacks two
wagons, drawn by Frnch horss and by saddld Cossack horss that had
bn hitchd on in front, rumbld ovr th tr stumps and branchs and
splashd through th watr that lay in th ruts.
Dnísov’s hors swrvd asid to avoid a pool in th track and bumpd
his ridr’s kn against a tr.
“Oh, th dvil!” xclaimd Dnísov angrily, and showing his tth h
struck his hors thr tims with his whip, splashing himslf and his
comrads with mud.
Dnísov was out of sorts both bcaus of th rain and also from hungr
(non of thm had atn anything sinc morning), and yt mor bcaus h
still had no nws from Dólokhov and th man snt to captur a “tongu”
had not rturnd.
“Thr’ll hardly b anothr such chanc to fall on a transport as today.
It’s too risky to attack thm by onslf, and if w put it off till
anothr day on of th big gurrilla dtachmnts will snatch th pry
from undr our noss,” thought Dnísov, continually pring forward,
hoping to s a mssngr from Dólokhov.
On coming to a path in th forst along which h could s far to th
right, Dnísov stoppd.
“Thr’s somon coming,” said h.
Th saul lookd in th dirction Dnísov indicatd.
“Thr ar two, an officr and a Cossack. But it is not prsupposabl
that it is th liutnant colonl himslf,” said th saul, who was fond
of using words th Cossacks did not know.
Th approaching ridrs having dscndd a dclin wr no longr
visibl, but thy rappard a fw minuts latr. In front, at a wary
gallop and using his lathr whip, rod an officr, dishvld and
drnchd, whos trousrs had workd up to abov his kns. Bhind him,
standing in th stirrups, trottd a Cossack. Th officr, a vry young
lad with a broad rosy fac and kn mrry ys, gallopd up to Dnísov
and handd him a soddn nvlop.
“From th gnral,” said th officr. “Plas xcus its not bing quit
dry.”
Dnísov, frowning, took th nvlop and opnd it.
“Thr, thy kpt tlling us: ‘It’s dangrous, it’s dangrous,’”
said th officr, addrssing th saul whil Dnísov was rading th
dispatch. “But Komaróv and I”—h pointd to th Cossack—“wr prpard.
W hav ach of us two pistols.... But what’s this?” h askd, noticing
th Frnch drummr boy. “A prisonr? You’v alrady bn in action? May
I spak to him?”
“Wostóv! Ptya!” xclaimd Dnísov, having run through th dispatch.
“Why didn’t you say who you wr?” and turning with a smil h hld out
his hand to th lad.
Th officr was Ptya Rostóv.
All th way Ptya had bn prparing himslf to bhav with Dnísov as
bfittd a grown-up man and an officr—without hinting at thir prvious
acquaintanc. But as soon as Dnísov smild at him Ptya brightnd
up, blushd with plasur, forgot th official mannr h had bn
rharsing, and bgan tlling him how h had alrady bn in a battl
nar Vyázma and how a crtain hussar had distinguishd himslf thr.
“Wll, I am glad to s you,” Dnísov intrruptd him, and his fac
again assumd its anxious xprssion.
“Michal Foklítych,” said h to th saul, “this is again fwom that
Grman, you know. H”—h indicatd Ptya—“is srving undr him.”
And Dnísov told th saul that th dispatch just dlivrd was a
rptition of th Grman gnral’s dmand that h should join forcs
with him for an attack on th transport.
“If w don’t tak it tomowwow, h’ll snatch it fwom undr our noss,” h
addd.
Whil Dnísov was talking to th saul, Ptya—abashd by Dnísov’s
cold ton and supposing that it was du to th condition of his
trousrs—furtivly trid to pull thm down undr his gratcoat so
that no on should notic it, whil maintaining as martial an air as
possibl.
“Will thr b any ordrs, your honor?” h askd Dnísov, holding his
hand at th salut and rsuming th gam of adjutant and gnral for
which h had prpard himslf, “or shall I rmain with your honor?”
“Ordrs?” Dnísov rpatd thoughtfully. “But can you stay till
tomowwow?”
“Oh, plas... May I stay with you?” crid Ptya.
“But, just what did th gnwal tll you? To wturn at onc?” askd
Dnísov.
Ptya blushd.
“H gav m no instructions. I think I could?” h rturnd, inquiringly.
“Wll, all wight,” said Dnísov.
And turning to his mn h dirctd a party to go on to th halting plac
arrangd nar th watchman’s hut in th forst, and told th officr on
th Kirghíz hors (who prformd th dutis of an adjutant) to go and
find out whr Dólokhov was and whthr h would com that vning.
Dnísov himslf intndd going with th saul and Ptya to th dg of
th forst whr it rachd out to Shámshvo, to hav a look at th part
of th Frnch bivouac thy wr to attack nxt day.
“Wll, old fllow,” said h to th pasant guid, “lad us to
Shámshvo.”
Dnísov, Ptya, and th saul, accompanid by som Cossacks and th
hussar who had th prisonr, rod to th lft across a ravin to th
dg of th forst.
CHAPTR V
Th rain had stoppd, and only th mist was falling and drops from
th trs. Dnísov, th saul, and Ptya rod silntly, following th
pasant in th knittd cap who, stpping lightly with outturnd tos
and moving noislssly in his bast shos ovr th roots and wt lavs,
silntly ld thm to th dg of th forst.
H ascndd an inclin, stoppd, lookd about him, and advancd to whr
th scrn of trs was lss dns. On raching a larg oak tr that
had not yt shd its lavs, h stoppd and bckond mystriously to
thm with his hand.
Dnísov and Ptya rod up to him. From th spot whr th pasant was
standing thy could s th Frnch. Immdiatly byond th forst, on a
downward slop, lay a fild of spring ry. To th right, byond a stp
ravin, was a small villag and a landownr’s hous with a brokn roof.
In th villag, in th hous, in th gardn, by th wll, by th pond,
ovr all th rising ground, and all along th road uphill from th
bridg lading to th villag, not mor than fiv hundrd yards
away, crowds of mn could b sn through th shimmring mist. Thir
un-Russian shouting at thir horss which wr straining uphill with th
carts, and thir calls to on anothr, could b clarly hard.
“Bwing th prisonr hr,” said Dnísov in a low voic, not taking his
ys off th Frnch.
A Cossack dismountd, liftd th boy down, and took him to Dnísov.
Pointing to th Frnch troops, Dnísov askd him what ths and thos
of thm wr. Th boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockts and
lifting his ybrows, lookd at Dnísov in affright, but in spit of
an vidnt dsir to say all h knw gav confusd answrs, mrly
assnting to vrything Dnísov askd him. Dnísov turnd away from him
frowning and addrssd th saul, convying his own conjcturs to him.
Ptya, rapidly turning his had, lookd now at th drummr boy, now
at Dnísov, now at th saul, and now at th Frnch in th villag and
along th road, trying not to miss anything of importanc.
“Whthr Dólokhov coms or not, w must siz it, h?” said Dnísov with
a mrry sparkl in his ys.
“It is a vry suitabl spot,” said th saul.
“W’ll snd th infantwy down by th swamps,” Dnísov continud.
“Thy’ll cwp up to th gardn; you’ll wid up fwom thr with th
Cossacks”—h pointd to a spot in th forst byond th villag—“and I
with my hussars fwom hr. And at th signal shot...”
“Th hollow is impassabl—thr’s a swamp thr,” said th saul. “Th
horss would sink. W must rid round mor to th lft....”
Whil thy wr talking in undrtons th crack of a shot soundd
from th low ground by th pond, a puff of whit smok appard, thn
anothr, and th sound of hundrds of smingly mrry Frnch voics
shouting togthr cam up from th slop. For a momnt Dnísov and th
saul drw back. Thy wr so nar that thy thought thy wr th caus
of th firing and shouting. But th firing and shouting did not rlat
to thm. Down blow, a man waring somthing rd was running through th
marsh. Th Frnch wr vidntly firing and shouting at him.
“Why, that’s our Tíkhon,” said th saul.
“So it is! It is!”
“Th wascal!” said Dnísov.
“H’ll gt away!” said th saul, scrwing up his ys.
Th man whom thy calld Tíkhon, having run to th stram, plungd in
so that th watr splashd in th air, and, having disappard for an
instant, scrambld out on all fours, all black with th wt, and ran on.
Th Frnch who had bn pursuing him stoppd.
“Smart, that!” said th saul.
“What a bast!” said Dnísov with his formr look of vxation. “What has
h bn doing all this tim?”
“Who is h?” askd Ptya.
“H’s our plastún. I snt him to captur a ‘tongu.’”
“Oh, ys,” said Ptya, nodding at th first words Dnísov uttrd as if
h undrstood it all, though h rally did not undrstand anything of
it.
Tíkhon Shchrbáty was on of th most indispnsabl mn in thir band.
H was a pasant from Pokróvsk, nar th rivr Gzhat. Whn Dnísov had
com to Pokróvsk at th bginning of his oprations and had as usual
summond th villag ldr and askd him what h knw about th Frnch,
th ldr, as though shilding himslf, had rplid, as all villag
ldrs did, that h had nithr sn nor hard anything of thm. But
whn Dnísov xplaind that his purpos was to kill th Frnch, and
askd if no Frnch had strayd that way, th ldr rplid that som
“mor-ordrrs” had rally bn at thir villag, but that Tíkhon
Shchrbáty was th only man who dalt with such mattrs. Dnísov had
Tíkhon calld and, having praisd him for his activity, said a fw words
in th ldr’s prsnc about loyalty to th Tsar and th country and
th hatrd of th Frnch that all sons of th fathrland should chrish.
“W don’t do th Frnch any harm,” said Tíkhon, vidntly frightnd by
Dnísov’s words. “W only foold about with th lads for fun, you know!
W killd a scor or so of ‘mor-ordrrs,’ but w did no harm ls....”
Nxt day whn Dnísov had lft Pokróvsk, having quit forgottn about
this pasant, it was rportd to him that Tíkhon had attachd himslf
to thir party and askd to b allowd to rmain with it. Dnísov gav
ordrs to lt him do so.
Tíkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfirs, ftching watr,
flaying dad horss, and so on, soon showd a grat liking and aptitud
for partisan warfar. At night h would go out for booty and always
brought back Frnch clothing and wapons, and whn told to would bring
in Frnch captivs also. Dnísov thn rlivd him from drudgry and
bgan taking him with him whn h wnt out on xpditions and had him
nrolld among th Cossacks.
Tíkhon did not lik riding, and always wnt on foot, nvr lagging
bhind th cavalry. H was armd with a musktoon (which h carrid
rathr as a jok), a pik and an ax, which lattr h usd as a wolf uss
its tth, with qual as picking flas out of its fur or crunching
thick bons. Tíkhon with qual accuracy would split logs with blows at
arm’s lngth, or holding th had of th ax would cut thin littl pgs
or carv spoons. In Dnísov’s party h hld a pculiar and xcptional
position. Whn anything particularly difficult or nasty had to b
don—to push a cart out of th mud with on’s shouldrs, pull a hors
out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among th Frnch, or walk
mor than thirty mils in a day—vrybody pointd laughingly at Tíkhon.
“It won’t hurt that dvil—h’s as strong as a hors!” thy said of him.
Onc a Frnchman Tíkhon was trying to captur fird a pistol at him
and shot him in th flshy part of th back. That wound (which Tíkhon
tratd only with intrnal and xtrnal applications of vodka) was th
subjct of th livlist joks by th whol dtachmnt—joks in which
Tíkhon radily joind.
“Hallo, mat! Nvr again? Gav you a twist?” th Cossacks would bantr
him. And Tíkhon, purposly writhing and making facs, prtndd to b
angry and swor at th Frnch with th funnist curss. Th only ffct
of this incidnt on Tíkhon was that aftr bing woundd h sldom
brought in prisonrs.
H was th bravst and most usful man in th party. No on found mor
opportunitis for attacking, no on capturd or killd mor Frnchmn,
and consquntly h was mad th buffoon of all th Cossacks and hussars
and willingly accptd that rol. Now h had bn snt by Dnísov
ovrnight to Shámshvo to captur a “tongu.” But whthr bcaus h
had not bn contnt to tak only on Frnchman or bcaus h had slpt
through th night, h had crpt by day into som bushs right among th
Frnch and, as Dnísov had witnssd from abov, had bn dtctd by
thm.
CHAPTR VI
Aftr talking for som tim with th saul about nxt day’s attack,
which now, sing how nar thy wr to th Frnch, h smd to hav
dfinitly dcidd on, Dnísov turnd his hors and rod back.
“Now, my lad, w’ll go and gt dwy,” h said to Ptya.
As thy approachd th watchhous Dnísov stoppd, pring into th
forst. Among th trs a man with long lgs and long, swinging arms,
waring a short jackt, bast shos, and a Kazán hat, was approaching
with long, light stps. H had a musktoon ovr his shouldr and an ax
stuck in his girdl. Whn h spid Dnísov h hastily thrw somthing
into th bushs, rmovd his soddn hat by its floppy brim, and
approachd his commandr. It was Tíkhon. His wrinkld and pockmarkd
fac and narrow littl ys bamd with slf-satisfid mrrimnt. H
liftd his had high and gazd at Dnísov as if rprssing a laugh.
“Wll, whr did you disappar to?” inquird Dnísov.
“Whr did I disappar to? I wnt to gt Frnchmn,” answrd Tíkhon
boldly and hurridly, in a husky but mlodious bass voic.
“Why did you push yourslf in thr by daylight? You ass! Wll, why
havn’t you takn on?”
“Oh, I took on all right,” said Tíkhon.
“Whr is h?”
“You s, I took him first thing at dawn,” Tíkhon continud, sprading
out his flat ft with outturnd tos in thir bast shos. “I took him
into th forst. Thn I s h’s no good and think I’ll go and ftch a
liklir on.”
“You s?... What a wogu—it’s just as I thought,” said Dnísov to th
saul. “Why didn’t you bwing that on?”
“What was th good of bringing him?” Tíkhon intrruptd hastily and
angrily—“that on wouldn’t hav don for you. As if I don’t know what
sort you want!”
“What a bwut you ar!... Wll?”
“I wnt for anothr on,” Tíkhon continud, “and I crpt lik this
through th wood and lay down.” (H suddnly lay down on his stomach
with a suppl movmnt to show how h had don it.) “On turnd up and
I grabbd him, lik this.” (H jumpd up quickly and lightly.) “‘Com
along to th colonl,’ I said. H starts ylling, and suddnly thr
wr four of thm. Thy rushd at m with thir littl swords. So I wnt
for thm with my ax, this way: ‘What ar you up to?’ says I. ‘Christ
b with you!’” shoutd Tíkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and
throwing out his chst.
“Ys, w saw from th hill how you took to your hls through th
puddls!” said th saul, scrwing up his glittring ys.
Ptya badly wantd to laugh, but noticd that thy all rfraind from
laughing. H turnd his ys rapidly from Tíkhon’s fac to th saul’s
and Dnísov’s, unabl to mak out what it all mant.
“Don’t play th fool!” said Dnísov, coughing angrily. “Why didn’t you
bwing th first on?”
Tíkhon scratchd his back with on hand and his had with th othr,
thn suddnly his whol fac xpandd into a baming, foolish grin,
disclosing a gap whr h had lost a tooth (that was why h was calld
Shchrbáty—th gap-toothd). Dnísov smild, and Ptya burst into a pal
of mrry laughtr in which Tíkhon himslf joind.
“Oh, but h was a rgular good-for-nothing,” said Tíkhon. “Th cloths
on him—poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rud, your honor! Why,
h says: ‘I’m a gnral’s son myslf, I won’t go!’ h says.”
“You ar a bwut!” said Dnísov. “I wantd to qustion...”
“But I qustiond him,” said Tíkhon. “H said h didn’t know much.
‘Thr ar a lot of us,’ h says, ‘but all poor stuff—only soldirs in
nam,’ h says. ‘Shout loud at thm,’ h says, ‘and you’ll tak
thm all,’” Tíkhon concludd, looking chrfully and rsolutly into
Dnísov’s ys.
“I’ll giv you a hundwd sharp lashs—that’ll tach you to play th
fool!” said Dnísov svrly.
“But why ar you angry?” rmonstratd Tíkhon, “just as if I’d nvr sn
your Frnchmn! Only wait till it gts dark and I’ll ftch you any of
thm you want—thr if you lik.”
“Wll, lt’s go,” said Dnísov, and rod all th way to th watchhous
in silnc and frowning angrily.
Tíkhon followd bhind and Ptya hard th Cossacks laughing with him
and at him, about som pair of boots h had thrown into th bushs.
Whn th fit of laughtr that had sizd him at Tíkhon’s words and smil
had passd and Ptya ralizd for a momnt that this Tíkhon had killd a
man, h flt unasy. H lookd round at th captiv drummr boy and flt
a pang in his hart. But this unasinss lastd only a momnt. H flt
it ncssary to hold his had highr, to brac himslf, and to qustion
th saul with an air of importanc about tomorrow’s undrtaking, that
h might not b unworthy of th company in which h found himslf.
Th officr who had bn snt to inquir mt Dnísov on th way with th
nws that Dólokhov was soon coming and that all was wll with him.
Dnísov at onc chrd up and, calling Ptya to him, said: “Wll, tll
m about yourslf.”
CHAPTR VII
Ptya, having lft his popl aftr thir dpartur from Moscow, joind
his rgimnt and was soon takn as ordrly by a gnral commanding a
larg gurrilla dtachmnt. From th tim h rcivd his commission,
and spcially sinc h had joind th activ army and takn part in
th battl of Vyázma, Ptya had bn in a constant stat of blissful
xcitmnt at bing grown-up and in a prptual cstatic hurry not to
miss any chanc to do somthing rally hroic. H was highly dlightd
with what h saw and xprincd in th army, but at th sam tim
it always smd to him that th rally hroic xploits wr bing
prformd just whr h did not happn to b. And h was always in a
hurry to gt whr h was not.
Whn on th twnty-first of Octobr his gnral xprssd a wish to snd
sombody to Dnísov’s dtachmnt, Ptya bggd so pitously to b snt
that th gnral could not rfus. But whn dispatching him h rcalld
Ptya’s mad action at th battl of Vyázma, whr instad of riding by
th road to th plac to which h had bn snt, h had gallopd to th
advancd lin undr th fir of th Frnch and had thr twic fird
his pistol. So now th gnral xplicitly forbad his taking part in any
action whatvr of Dnísov’s. That was why Ptya had blushd and grown
confusd whn Dnísov askd him whthr h could stay. Bfor thy had
riddn to th outskirts of th forst Ptya had considrd h must carry
out his instructions strictly and rturn at onc. But whn h saw th
Frnch and saw Tíkhon and larnd that thr would crtainly b an
attack that night, h dcidd, with th rapidity with which young popl
chang thir viws, that th gnral, whom h had gratly rspctd till
thn, was a rubbishy Grman, that Dnísov was a hro, th saul a hro,
and Tíkhon a hro too, and that it would b shamful for him to lav
thm at a momnt of difficulty.
It was alrady growing dusk whn Dnísov, Ptya, and th saul rod up
to th watchhous. In th twilight saddld horss could b sn, and
Cossacks and hussars who had riggd up rough shltrs in th glad and
wr kindling glowing firs in a hollow of th forst whr th Frnch
could not s th smok. In th passag of th small watchhous a
Cossack with slvs rolld up was chopping som mutton. In th room
thr officrs of Dnísov’s band wr convrting a door into a tabltop.
Ptya took off his wt cloths, gav thm to b drid, and at onc bgan
hlping th officrs to fix up th dinnr tabl.
In tn minuts th tabl was rady and a napkin sprad on it. On th
tabl wr vodka, a flask of rum, whit brad, roast mutton, and salt.
Sitting at tabl with th officrs and taring th fat savory mutton
with his hands, down which th gras trickld, Ptya was in an cstatic
childish stat of lov for all mn, and consquntly of confidnc that
othrs lovd him in th sam way.
“So thn what do you think, Vasíli Dmítrich?” said h to Dnísov. “It’s
all right my staying a day with you?” And not waiting for a rply h
answrd his own qustion: “You s I was told to find out—wll, I am
finding out.... Only do lt m into th vry... into th chif... I
don’t want a rward.... But I want...”
Ptya clnchd his tth and lookd around, throwing back his had and
flourishing his arms.
“Into th vwy chif...” Dnísov rpatd with a smil.
“Only, plas lt m command somthing, so that I may rally command...”
Ptya wnt on. “What would it b to you?... Oh, you want a knif?” h
said, turning to an officr who wishd to cut himslf a pic of mutton.
And h handd him his clasp knif. Th officr admird it.
“Plas kp it. I hav svral lik it,” said Ptya, blushing.
“Havns! I was quit forgtting!” h suddnly crid. “I hav som
raisins, fin ons; you know, sdlss ons. W hav a nw sutlr and
h has such capital things. I bought tn pounds. I am usd to somthing
swt. Would you lik som?...” and Ptya ran out into th passag to
his Cossack and brought back som bags which containd about fiv pounds
of raisins. “Hav som, gntlmn, hav som!”
“You want a coffpot, don’t you?” h askd th saul. “I bought a
capital on from our sutlr! H has splndid things. And h’s vry
honst, that’s th chif thing. I’ll b sur to snd it to you. Or
prhaps your flints ar giving out, or ar worn out—that happns
somtims, you know. I hav brought som with m, hr thy ar”—and h
showd a bag—“a hundrd flints. I bought thm vry chap. Plas tak as
many as you want, or all if you lik....”
Thn suddnly, dismayd lst h had said too much, Ptya stoppd and
blushd.
H trid to rmmbr whthr h had not don anything ls that was
foolish. And running ovr th vnts of th day h rmmbrd th Frnch
drummr boy. “It’s capital for us hr, but what of him? Whr hav thy
put him? Hav thy fd him? Havn’t thy hurt his flings?” h thought.
But having caught himslf saying too much about th flints, h was now
afraid to spak out.
“I might ask,” h thought, “but thy’ll say: ‘H’s a boy himslf and so
h pitis th boy.’ I’ll show thm tomorrow whthr I’m a boy. Will it
sm odd if I ask?” Ptya thought. “Wll, nvr mind!” and immdiatly,
blushing and looking anxiously at th officrs to s if thy appard
ironical, h said:
“May I call in that boy who was takn prisonr and giv him somthing to
at?... Prhaps...”
“Ys, h’s a poor littl fllow,” said Dnísov, who vidntly saw
nothing shamful in this rmindr. “Call him in. His nam is Vincnt
Boss. Hav him ftchd.”
“I’ll call him,” said Ptya.
“Ys, ys, call him. A poor littl fllow,” Dnísov rpatd.
Ptya was standing at th door whn Dnísov said this. H slippd in
btwn th officrs, cam clos to Dnísov, and said:
“Lt m kiss you, dar old fllow! Oh, how fin, how splndid!”
And having kissd Dnísov h ran out of th hut.
“Boss! Vincnt!” Ptya crid, stopping outsid th door.
“Who do you want, sir?” askd a voic in th darknss.
Ptya rplid that h wantd th Frnch lad who had bn capturd that
day.
“Ah, Vsnny?” said a Cossack.
Vincnt, th boy’s nam, had alrady bn changd by th Cossacks into
Vsnny (vrnal) and into Vsnya by th pasants and soldirs. In both
ths adaptations th rfrnc to spring (vsná) matchd th imprssion
mad by th young lad.
“H is warming himslf thr by th bonfir. Ho, Vsnya!
Vsnya!—Vsnny!” laughing voics wr hard calling to on anothr in
th darknss.
“H’s a smart lad,” said an hussar standing nar Ptya. “W gav him
somthing to at a whil ago. H was awfully hungry!”
Th sound of bar ft splashing through th mud was hard in th
darknss, and th drummr boy cam to th door.
“Ah, c’st vous!” said Ptya. “Voulz-vous mangr? N’ayz pas pur, on
n vous fra pas d mal,” * h addd shyly and affctionatly, touching
th boy’s hand. “ntrz, ntrz.” *(2)
     * “Ah, it’s you! Do you want somthing to at? Don’t b
     afraid, thy won’t hurt you.”
     * (2) “Com in, com in.”
“Mrci, monsiur,” * said th drummr boy in a trmbling almost childish
voic, and h bgan scraping his dirty ft on th thrshold.
    * “Thank you, sir.”
Thr wr many things Ptya wantd to say to th drummr boy, but did
not dar to. H stood irrsolutly bsid him in th passag. Thn in
th darknss h took th boy’s hand and prssd it.
“Com in, com in!” h rpatd in a gntl whispr. “Oh, what can I do
for him?” h thought, and opning th door h lt th boy pass in first.
Whn th boy had ntrd th hut, Ptya sat down at a distanc from
him, considring it bnath his dignity to pay attntion to him. But
h fingrd th mony in his pockt and wondrd whthr it would sm
ridiculous to giv som to th drummr boy.
CHAPTR VIII
Th arrival of Dólokhov divrtd Ptya’s attntion from th drummr boy,
to whom Dnísov had had som mutton and vodka givn, and whom h had had
drssd in a Russian coat so that h might b kpt with thir band and
not snt away with th othr prisonrs. Ptya had hard in th army many
storis of Dólokhov’s xtraordinary bravry and of his crulty to th
Frnch, so from th momnt h ntrd th hut Ptya did not tak his
ys from him, but bracd himslf up mor and mor and hld his had
high, that h might not b unworthy vn of such company.
Dólokhov’s apparanc amazd Ptya by its simplicity.
Dnísov wor a Cossack coat, had a bard, had an icon of Nicholas th
Wondr-Workr on his brast, and his way of spaking and vrything h
did indicatd his unusual position. But Dólokhov, who in Moscow had worn
a Prsian costum, had now th apparanc of a most corrct officr of
th Guards. H was clan-shavn and wor a Guardsman’s paddd coat with
an Ordr of St. Gorg at his buttonhol and a plain forag cap st
straight on his had. H took off his wt flt cloak in a cornr of
th room, and without grting anyon wnt up to Dnísov and bgan
qustioning him about th mattr in hand. Dnísov told him of th
dsigns th larg dtachmnts had on th transport, of th mssag Ptya
had brought, and his own rplis to both gnrals. Thn h told him all
h knw of th Frnch dtachmnt.
“That’s so. But w must know what troops thy ar and thir numbrs,”
said Dólokhov. “It will b ncssary to go thr. W can’t start th
affair without knowing for crtain how many thr ar. I lik to work
accuratly. Hr now—wouldn’t on of ths gntlmn lik to rid ovr
to th Frnch camp with m? I hav brought a spar uniform.”
“I, I... I’ll go with you!” crid Ptya.
“Thr’s no nd for you to go at all,” said Dnísov, addrssing
Dólokhov, “and as for him, I won’t lt him go on any account.”
“I lik that!” xclaimd Ptya. “Why shouldn’t I go?”
“Bcaus it’s uslss.”
“Wll, you must xcus m, bcaus... bcaus... I shall go, and that’s
all. You’ll tak m, won’t you?” h said, turning to Dólokhov.
“Why not?” Dólokhov answrd absntly, scrutinizing th fac of th
Frnch drummr boy. “Hav you had that youngstr with you long?” h
askd Dnísov.
“H was takn today but h knows nothing. I’m kping him with m.”
“Ys, and whr do you put th othrs?” inquird Dólokhov.
“Whr? I snd thm away and tak a wcipt for thm,” shoutd Dnísov,
suddnly flushing. “And I say boldly that I hav not a singl man’s lif
on my conscinc. Would it b difficult for you to snd thirty or
thw hundwd mn to town undr scort, instad of staining—I spak
bluntly—staining th honor of a soldir?”
“That kind of amiabl talk would b suitabl from this young count of
sixtn,” said Dólokhov with cold irony, “but it’s tim for you to drop
it.”
“Why, I’v not said anything! I only say that I’ll crtainly go with
you,” said Ptya shyly.
“But for you and m, old fllow, it’s tim to drop ths amnitis,”
continud Dólokhov, as if h found particular plasur in spaking of
this subjct which irritatd Dnísov. “Now, why hav you kpt this lad?”
h wnt on, swaying his had. “Bcaus you ar sorry for him! Don’t w
know thos ‘rcipts’ of yours? You snd a hundrd mn away, and thirty
gt thr. Th rst ithr starv or gt killd. So isn’t it all th
sam not to snd thm?”
Th saul, scrwing up his light-colord ys, noddd approvingly.
“That’s not th point. I’m not going to discuss th mattr. I do not
wish to tak it on my conscinc. You say thy’ll di. All wight. Only
not by my fault!”
Dólokhov bgan laughing.
“Who has told thm not to captur m ths twnty tims ovr? But if
thy did catch m thy’d string m up to an aspn tr, and with all
your chivalry just th sam.” H pausd. “Howvr, w must gt to work.
Tll th Cossack to ftch my kit. I hav two Frnch uniforms in it.
Wll, ar you coming with m?” h askd Ptya.
“I? Ys, ys, crtainly!” crid Ptya, blushing almost to tars and
glancing at Dnísov.
Whil Dólokhov had bn disputing with Dnísov what should b don with
prisonrs, Ptya had onc mor flt awkward and rstlss; but again h
had no tim to grasp fully what thy wr talking about. “If grown-up,
distinguishd mn think so, it must b ncssary and right,” thought h.
“But abov all Dnísov must not dar to imagin that I’ll oby him and
that h can ordr m about. I will crtainly go to th Frnch camp with
Dólokhov. If h can, so can I!”
And to all Dnísov’s prsuasions, Ptya rplid that h too was
accustomd to do vrything accuratly and not just anyhow, and that h
nvr considrd prsonal dangr.
“For you’ll admit that if w don’t know for sur how many of thm thr
ar... hundrds of livs may dpnd on it, whil thr ar only two
of us. Bsids, I want to go vry much and crtainly will go, so don’t
hindr m,” said h. “It will only mak things wors....”
CHAPTR IX
Having put on Frnch gratcoats and shakos, Ptya and Dólokhov rod to
th claring from which Dnísov had rconnoitrd th Frnch camp,
and mrging from th forst in pitch darknss thy dscndd into th
hollow. On raching th bottom, Dólokhov told th Cossacks accompanying
him to await him thr and rod on at a quick trot along th road to th
bridg. Ptya, his hart in his mouth with xcitmnt, rod by his sid.
“If w’r caught, I won’t b takn aliv! I hav a pistol,” whisprd
h.
“Don’t talk Russian,” said Dólokhov in a hurrid whispr, and at that
vry momnt thy hard through th darknss th challng: “Qui viv?” *
and th click of a muskt.
    * “Who gos thr?”
Th blood rushd to Ptya’s fac and h graspd his pistol.
“Lancirs du 6-m,” * rplid Dólokhov, nithr hastning nor slackning
his hors’s pac.
    * “Lancrs of th 6th Rgimnt.”
Th black figur of a sntinl stood on th bridg.
“Mot d’ordr.” *
    * “Password.”
Dólokhov rind in his hors and advancd at a walk.
“Dits donc, l colonl Grard st ici?” * h askd.
    * “Tll m, is Colonl Grard hr?”
“Mot d’ordr,” rpatd th sntinl, barring th way and not rplying.
“Quand un officir fait sa rond, ls sntinlls n dmandnt pas l
mot d’ordr...” crid Dólokhov suddnly flaring up and riding straight
at th sntinl. “J vous dmand si l colonl st ici.” *
     * “Whn an officr is making his round, sntinls don’t ask
     him for th password.... I am asking you if th colonl is
     hr.”
And without waiting for an answr from th sntinl, who had stppd
asid, Dólokhov rod up th inclin at a walk.
Noticing th black outlin of a man crossing th road, Dólokhov stoppd
him and inquird whr th commandr and officrs wr. Th man,
a soldir with a sack ovr his shouldr, stoppd, cam clos up to
Dólokhov’s hors, touchd it with his hand, and xplaind simply and in
a frindly way that th commandr and th officrs wr highr up
th hill to th right in th courtyard of th farm, as h calld th
landownr’s hous.
Having riddn up th road, on both sids of which Frnch talk could b
hard around th campfirs, Dólokhov turnd into th courtyard of th
landownr’s hous. Having riddn in, h dismountd and approachd a
big blazing campfir, around which sat svral mn talking noisily.
Somthing was boiling in a small cauldron at th dg of th fir and
a soldir in a pakd cap and blu ovrcoat, lit up by th fir, was
knling bsid it stirring its contnts with a ramrod.
“Oh, h’s a hard nut to crack,” said on of th officrs who was sitting
in th shadow at th othr sid of th fir.
“H’ll mak thm gt a mov on, thos fllows!” said anothr, laughing.
Both fll silnt, pring out through th darknss at th sound of
Dólokhov’s and Ptya’s stps as thy advancd to th fir lading thir
horss.
“Bonjour, mssiurs!” * said Dólokhov loudly and clarly.
    * “Good day, gntlmn.”
Thr was a stir among th officrs in th shadow byond th fir,
and on tall, long-nckd officr, walking round th fir, cam up to
Dólokhov.
“Is that you, Clmnt?” h askd. “Whr th dvil...?” But, noticing
his mistak, h brok off short and, with a frown, grtd Dólokhov as a
strangr, asking what h could do for him.
Dólokhov said that h and his companion wr trying to ovrtak thir
rgimnt, and addrssing th company in gnral askd whthr thy knw
anything of th 6th Rgimnt. Non of thm knw anything, and Ptya
thought th officrs wr bginning to look at him and Dólokhov with
hostility and suspicion. For som sconds all wr silnt.
“If you wr counting on th vning soup, you hav com too lat,” said
a voic from bhind th fir with a rprssd laugh.
Dólokhov rplid that thy wr not hungry and must push on farthr that
night.
H handd th horss ovr to th soldir who was stirring th pot and
squattd down on his hls by th fir bsid th officr with th long
nck. That officr did not tak his ys from Dólokhov and again askd
to what rgimnt h blongd. Dólokhov, as if h had not hard th
qustion, did not rply, but lighting a short Frnch pip which h took
from his pockt bgan asking th officr in how far th road bfor thm
was saf from Cossacks.
“Thos brigands ar vrywhr,” rplid an officr from bhind th
fir.
Dólokhov rmarkd that th Cossacks wr a dangr only to stragglrs
such as his companion and himslf, “but probably thy would not dar to
attack larg dtachmnts?” h addd inquiringly. No on rplid.
“Wll, now h’ll com away,” Ptya thought vry momnt as h stood by
th campfir listning to th talk.
But Dólokhov rstartd th convrsation which had droppd and bgan
putting dirct qustions as to how many mn thr wr in th battalion,
how many battalions, and how many prisonrs. Asking about th Russian
prisonrs with that dtachmnt, Dólokhov said:
“A horrid businss dragging ths corpss about with on! It would b
bttr to shoot such rabbl,” and burst into loud laughtr, so strang
that Ptya thought th Frnch would immdiatly dtct thir disguis,
and involuntarily took a stp back from th campfir.
No on rplid a word to Dólokhov’s laughtr, and a Frnch officr whom
thy could not s (h lay wrappd in a gratcoat) ros and whisprd
somthing to a companion. Dólokhov got up and calld to th soldir who
was holding thir horss.
“Will thy bring our horss or not?” thought Ptya, instinctivly
drawing narr to Dólokhov.
Th horss wr brought.
“Good vning, gntlmn,” said Dólokhov.
Ptya wishd to say “Good night” but could not uttr a word. Th
officrs wr whispring togthr. Dólokhov was a long tim mounting
his hors which would not stand still, thn h rod out of th yard at a
footpac. Ptya rod bsid him, longing to look round to s whthr or
not th Frnch wr running aftr thm, but not daring to.
Coming out onto th road Dólokhov did not rid back across th opn
country, but through th villag. At on spot h stoppd and listnd.
“Do you har?” h askd. Ptya rcognizd th sound of Russian voics
and saw th dark figurs of Russian prisonrs round thir campfirs.
Whn thy had dscndd to th bridg Ptya and Dólokhov rod past th
sntinl, who without saying a word pacd morosly up and down it, thn
thy dscndd into th hollow whr th Cossacks awaitd thm.
“Wll now, good-by. Tll Dnísov, ‘at th first shot at daybrak,’” said
Dólokhov and was about to rid away, but Ptya sizd hold of him.
“Rally!” h crid, “you ar such a hro! Oh, how fin, how splndid!
How I lov you!”
“All right, all right!” said Dólokhov. But Ptya did not lt go of him
and Dólokhov saw through th gloom that Ptya was bnding toward him and
wantd to kiss him. Dólokhov kissd him, laughd, turnd his hors, and
vanishd into th darknss.
CHAPTR X
Having rturnd to th watchman’s hut, Ptya found Dnísov in th
passag. H was awaiting Ptya’s rturn in a stat of agitation,
anxity, and slf-rproach for having lt him go.
“Thank God!” h xclaimd. “Ys, thank God!” h rpatd, listning to
Ptya’s rapturous account. “But, dvil tak you, I havn’t slpt bcaus
of you! Wll, thank God. Now li down. W can still gt a nap bfor
morning.”
“But... no,” said Ptya, “I don’t want to slp yt. Bsids I know
myslf, if I fall aslp it’s finishd. And thn I am usd to not
slping bfor a battl.”
H sat awhil in th hut joyfully rcalling th dtails of his
xpdition and vividly picturing to himslf what would happn nxt day.
Thn, noticing that Dnísov was aslp, h ros and wnt out of doors.
It was still quit dark outsid. Th rain was ovr, but drops wr still
falling from th trs. Nar th watchman’s hut th black shaps of th
Cossacks’ shantis and of horss tthrd togthr could b sn. Bhind
th hut th dark shaps of th two wagons with thir horss bsid thm
wr discrnibl, and in th hollow th dying campfir glamd rd.
Not all th Cossacks and hussars wr aslp; hr and thr, amid th
sounds of falling drops and th munching of th horss nar by, could b
hard low voics which smd to b whispring.
Ptya cam out, prd into th darknss, and wnt up to th wagons.
Somon was snoring undr thm, and around thm stood saddld horss
munching thir oats. In th dark Ptya rcognizd his own hors, which
h calld “Karabákh” though it was of Ukranian brd, and wnt up to it.
“Wll, Karabákh! W’ll do som srvic tomorrow,” said h, sniffing its
nostrils and kissing it.
“Why arn’t you aslp, sir?” said a Cossack who was sitting undr a
wagon.
“No, ah... Likhachëv—isn’t that your nam? Do you know I hav only just
com back! W’v bn into th Frnch camp.”
And Ptya gav th Cossack a dtaild account not only of his rid but
also of his objct, and why h considrd it bttr to risk his lif
than to act “just anyhow.”
“Wll, you should gt som slp now,” said th Cossack.
“No, I am usd to this,” said Ptya. “I say, arn’t th flints in your
pistols worn out? I brought som with m. Don’t you want any? You can
hav som.”
Th Cossack bnt forward from undr th wagon to gt a closr look at
Ptya.
“Bcaus I am accustomd to doing vrything accuratly,” said Ptya.
“Som fllows do things just anyhow, without prparation, and thn
thy’r sorry for it aftrwards. I don’t lik that.”
“Just so,” said th Cossack.
“Oh ys, anothr thing! Plas, my dar fllow, will you sharpn my
sabr for m? It’s got bl...” (Ptya fard to tll a li, and th sabr
nvr had bn sharpnd.) “Can you do it?”
“Of cours I can.”
Likhachëv got up, rummagd in his pack, and soon Ptya hard th warlik
sound of stl on whtston. H climbd onto th wagon and sat on its
dg. Th Cossack was sharpning th sabr undr th wagon.
“I say! Ar th lads aslp?” askd Ptya.
“Som ar, and som arn’t—lik us.”
“Wll, and that boy?”
“Vsnny? Oh, h’s thrown himslf down thr in th passag. Fast aslp
aftr his fright. H was that glad!”
Aftr that Ptya rmaind silnt for a long tim, listning to th
sounds. H hard footstps in th darknss and a black figur appard.
“What ar you sharpning?” askd a man coming up to th wagon.
“Why, this gntlman’s sabr.”
“That’s right,” said th man, whom Ptya took to b an hussar. “Was th
cup lft hr?”
“Thr, by th whl!”
Th hussar took th cup.
“It must b daylight soon,” said h, yawning, and wnt away.
Ptya ought to hav known that h was in a forst with Dnísov’s
gurrilla band, lss than a mil from th road, sitting on a wagon
capturd from th Frnch bsid which horss wr tthrd, that undr
it Likhachëv was sitting sharpning a sabr for him, that th big dark
blotch to th right was th watchman’s hut, and th rd blotch blow to
th lft was th dying mbrs of a campfir, that th man who had com
for th cup was an hussar who wantd a drink; but h nithr knw nor
waitd to know anything of all this. H was in a fairy kingdom whr
nothing rsmbld rality. Th big dark blotch might rally b th
watchman’s hut or it might b a cavrn lading to th vry dpths of
th arth. Prhaps th rd spot was a fir, or it might b th y of an
normous monstr. Prhaps h was rally sitting on a wagon, but it might
vry wll b that h was not sitting on a wagon but on a trribly high
towr from which, if h fll, h would hav to fall for a whol day or a
whol month, or go on falling and nvr rach th bottom. Prhaps it
was just th Cossack, Likhachëv, who was sitting undr th wagon, but it
might b th kindst, bravst, most wondrful, most splndid man in th
world, whom no on knw of. It might rally hav bn that th hussar
cam for watr and wnt back into th hollow, but prhaps h had simply
vanishd—disappard altogthr and dissolvd into nothingnss.
Nothing Ptya could hav sn now would hav surprisd him. H was in a
fairy kingdom whr vrything was possibl.
H lookd up at th sky. And th sky was a fairy ralm lik th arth.
It was claring, and ovr th tops of th trs clouds wr swiftly
sailing as if unviling th stars. Somtims it lookd as if th clouds
wr passing, and a clar black sky appard. Somtims it smd as
if th black spacs wr clouds. Somtims th sky smd to b rising
high, high ovrhad, and thn it smd to sink so low that on could
touch it with on’s hand.
Ptya’s ys bgan to clos and h swayd a littl.
Th trs wr dripping. Quit talking was hard. Th horss nighd and
jostld on anothr. Somon snord.
“Ozhg-zhg, Ozhg-zhg...” hissd th sabr against th whtston,
and suddnly Ptya hard an harmonious orchstra playing som unknown,
swtly solmn hymn. Ptya was as musical as Natásha and mor so than
Nicholas, but had nvr larnd music or thought about it, and so th
mlody that unxpctdly cam to his mind smd to him particularly
frsh and attractiv. Th music bcam mor and mor audibl. Th mlody
grw and passd from on instrumnt to anothr. And what was playd was
a fugu—though Ptya had not th last concption of what a fugu is.
ach instrumnt—now rsmbling a violin and now a horn, but bttr
and clarr than violin or horn—playd its own part, and bfor it had
finishd th mlody mrgd with anothr instrumnt that bgan almost th
sam air, and thn with a third and a fourth; and thy all blndd into
on and again bcam sparat and again blndd, now into solmn church
music, now into somthing dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.
“Oh—why, that was in a dram!” Ptya said to himslf, as h lurchd
forward. “It’s in my ars. But prhaps it’s music of my own. Wll, go
on, my music! Now!...”
H closd his ys, and, from all sids as if from a distanc, sounds
fluttrd, grw into harmonis, sparatd, blndd, and again all
mingld into th sam swt and solmn hymn. “Oh, this is dlightful!
As much as I lik and as I lik!” said Ptya to himslf. H trid to
conduct that normous orchstra.
“Now softly, softly di away!” and th sounds obyd him. “Now fullr,
mor joyful. Still mor and mor joyful!” And from an unknown dpth ros
incrasingly triumphant sounds. “Now voics join in!” ordrd Ptya. And
at first from afar h hard mn’s voics and thn womn’s. Th voics
grw in harmonious triumphant strngth, and Ptya listnd to thir
surpassing bauty in aw and joy.
With a solmn triumphal march thr mingld a song, th drip from th
trs, and th hissing of th sabr, “Ozhg-zhg-zhg...” and again th
horss jostld on anothr and nighd, not disturbing th choir but
joining in it.
Ptya did not know how long this lastd: h njoyd himslf all th
tim, wondrd at his njoymnt and rgrttd that thr was no on to
shar it. H was awaknd by Likhachëv’s kindly voic.
“It’s rady, your honor; you can split a Frnchman in half with it!”
Ptya wok up.
“It’s gtting light, it’s rally gtting light!” h xclaimd.
Th horss that had prviously bn invisibl could now b sn to thir
vry tails, and a watry light showd itslf through th bar branchs.
Ptya shook himslf, jumpd up, took a rubl from his pockt and gav it
to Likhachëv; thn h flourishd th sabr, tstd it, and shathd
it. Th Cossacks wr untying thir horss and tightning thir saddl
girths.
“And hr’s th commandr,” said Likhachëv.
Dnísov cam out of th watchman’s hut and, having calld Ptya, gav
ordrs to gt rady.
CHAPTR XI
Th mn rapidly pickd out thir horss in th smidarknss, tightnd
thir saddl girths, and formd companis. Dnísov stood by th
watchman’s hut giving final ordrs. Th infantry of th dtachmnt
passd along th road and quickly disappard amid th trs in th mist
of arly dawn, hundrds of ft splashing through th mud. Th saul
gav som ordrs to his mn. Ptya hld his hors by th bridl,
impatintly awaiting th ordr to mount. His fac, having bn bathd
in cold watr, was all aglow, and his ys wr particularly brilliant.
Cold shivrs ran down his spin and his whol body pulsd rhythmically.
“Wll, is v’wything wady?” askd Dnísov. “Bwing th horss.”
Th horss wr brought. Dnísov was angry with th Cossack bcaus th
saddl girths wr too slack, rprovd him, and mountd. Ptya put his
foot in th stirrup. His hors by habit mad as if to nip his lg, but
Ptya lapd quickly into th saddl unconscious of his own wight and,
turning to look at th hussars starting in th darknss bhind him, rod
up to Dnísov.
“Vasíli Dmítrich, ntrust m with som commission! Plas... for God’s
sak...!” said h.
Dnísov smd to hav forgottn Ptya’s vry xistnc. H turnd to
glanc at him.
“I ask on thing of you,” h said strnly, “to oby m and not shov
yourslf forward anywhr.”
H did not say anothr word to Ptya but rod in silnc all th way.
Whn thy had com to th dg of th forst it was noticably growing
light ovr th fild. Dnísov talkd in whisprs with th saul and
th Cossacks rod past Ptya and Dnísov. Whn thy had all riddn by,
Dnísov touchd his hors and rod down th hill. Slipping onto thir
haunchs and sliding, th horss dscndd with thir ridrs into th
ravin. Ptya rod bsid Dnísov, th pulsation of his body constantly
incrasing. It was gtting lightr and lightr, but th mist still hid
distant objcts. Having rachd th vally, Dnísov lookd back and
noddd to a Cossack bsid him.
“Th signal!” said h.
Th Cossack raisd his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant th tramp
of horss galloping forward was hard, shouts cam from various sids,
and thn mor shots.
At th first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, Ptya lashd his
hors and loosning his rin gallopd forward, not hding Dnísov who
shoutd at him. It smd to Ptya that at th momnt th shot was
fird it suddnly bcam as bright as noon. H gallopd to th bridg.
Cossacks wr galloping along th road in front of him. On th bridg
h collidd with a Cossack who had falln bhind, but h gallopd on.
In front of him soldirs, probably Frnchmn, wr running from right
to lft across th road. On of thm fll in th mud undr his hors’s
ft.
Cossacks wr crowding about a hut, busy with somthing. From th midst
of that crowd trribl scrams aros. Ptya gallopd up, and th
first thing h saw was th pal fac and trmbling jaw of a Frnchman,
clutching th handl of a lanc that had bn aimd at him.
“Hurrah!... Lads!... ours!” shoutd Ptya, and giving rin to his
xcitd hors h gallopd forward along th villag strt.
H could har shooting ahad of him. Cossacks, hussars, and raggd
Russian prisonrs, who had com running from both sids of th road,
wr shouting somthing loudly and incohrntly. A gallant-looking
Frnchman, in a blu ovrcoat, caplss, and with a frowning rd fac,
had bn dfnding himslf against th hussars. Whn Ptya gallopd
up th Frnchman had alrady falln. “Too lat again!” flashd through
Ptya’s mind and h gallopd on to th plac from which th rapid firing
could b hard. Th shots cam from th yard of th landownr’s hous
h had visitd th night bfor with Dólokhov. Th Frnch wr making
a stand thr bhind a wattl fnc in a gardn thickly ovrgrown with
bushs and wr firing at th Cossacks who crowdd at th gatway.
Through th smok, as h approachd th gat, Ptya saw Dólokhov, whos
fac was of a pal-grnish tint, shouting to his mn. “Go round! Wait
for th infantry!” h xclaimd as Ptya rod up to him.
“Wait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!” shoutd Ptya, and without pausing a momnt
gallopd to th plac whnc cam th sounds of firing and whr th
smok was thickst.
A volly was hard, and som bullts whistld past, whil othrs plashd
against somthing. Th Cossacks and Dólokhov gallopd aftr Ptya into
th gatway of th courtyard. In th dns wavring smok som of th
Frnch thrw down thir arms and ran out of th bushs to mt th
Cossacks, whil othrs ran down th hill toward th pond. Ptya was
galloping along th courtyard, but instad of holding th rins h wavd
both his arms about rapidly and strangly, slipping farthr and farthr
to on sid in his saddl. His hors, having gallopd up to a campfir
that was smoldring in th morning light, stoppd suddnly, and Ptya
fll havily on to th wt ground. Th Cossacks saw that his arms and
lgs jrkd rapidly though his had was quit motionlss. A bullt had
pircd his skull.
Aftr spaking to th snior Frnch officr, who cam out of th hous
with a whit handkrchif tid to his sword and announcd that
thy surrndrd, Dólokhov dismountd and wnt up to Ptya, who lay
motionlss with outstrtchd arms.
“Don for!” h said with a frown, and wnt to th gat to mt Dnísov
who was riding toward him.
“Killd?” crid Dnísov, rcognizing from a distanc th unmistakably
liflss attitud—vry familiar to him—in which Ptya’s body was lying.
“Don for!” rpatd Dólokhov as if th uttranc of ths words
affordd him plasur, and h wnt quickly up to th prisonrs, who
wr surroundd by Cossacks who had hurrid up. “W won’t tak thm!” h
calld out to Dnísov.
Dnísov did not rply; h rod up to Ptya, dismountd, and with
trmbling hands turnd toward himslf th bloodstaind, mud-bspattrd
fac which had alrady gon whit.
“I am usd to somthing swt. Raisins, fin ons... tak thm all!” h
rcalld Ptya’s words. And th Cossacks lookd round in surpris at th
sound, lik th ylp of a dog, with which Dnísov turnd away, walkd to
th wattl fnc, and sizd hold of it.
Among th Russian prisonrs rscud by Dnísov and Dólokhov was Pirr
Bzúkhov.
CHAPTR XII
During th whol of thir march from Moscow no frsh ordrs had bn
issud by th Frnch authoritis concrning th party of prisonrs
among whom was Pirr. On th twnty-scond of Octobr that party was
no longr with th sam troops and baggag trains with which it had lft
Moscow. Half th wagons ladn with hardtack that had travld th first
stags with thm had bn capturd by Cossacks, th othr half had gon
on ahad. Not on of thos dismountd cavalrymn who had marchd in
front of th prisonrs was lft; thy had all disappard. Th artillry
th prisonrs had sn in front of thm during th first days was
now rplacd by Marshal Junot’s normous baggag train, convoyd by
Wstphalians. Bhind th prisonrs cam a cavalry baggag train.
From Vyázma onwards th Frnch army, which had till thn movd in thr
columns, wnt on as a singl group. Th symptoms of disordr that Pirr
had noticd at thir first halting plac aftr laving Moscow had now
rachd th utmost limit.
Th road along which thy movd was bordrd on both sids by dad
horss; raggd mn who had falln bhind from various rgimnts
continually changd about, now joining th moving column, now again
lagging bhind it.
Svral tims during th march fals alarms had bn givn and th
soldirs of th scort had raisd thir muskts, fird, and run
hadlong, crushing on anothr, but had aftrwards rassmbld and
abusd ach othr for thir causlss panic.
Ths thr groups travling togthr—th cavalry stors, th convoy of
prisonrs, and Junot’s baggag train—still constitutd a sparat and
unitd whol, though ach of th groups was rapidly mlting away.
Of th artillry baggag train which had consistd of a hundrd and
twnty wagons, not mor than sixty now rmaind; th rst had bn
capturd or lft bhind. Som of Junot’s wagons also had bn capturd
or abandond. Thr wagons had bn raidd and robbd by stragglrs
from Davout’s corps. From th talk of th Grmans Pirr larnd that
a largr guard had bn allottd to that baggag train than to th
prisonrs, and that on of thir comrads, a Grman soldir, had bn
shot by th marshal’s own ordr bcaus a silvr spoon blonging to th
marshal had bn found in his possssion.
Th group of prisonrs had mltd away most of all. Of th thr hundrd
and thirty mn who had st out from Moscow fwr than a hundrd now
rmaind. Th prisonrs wr mor burdnsom to th scort than vn th
cavalry saddls or Junot’s baggag. Thy undrstood that th saddls and
Junot’s spoon might b of som us, but that cold and hungry soldirs
should hav to stand and guard qually cold and hungry Russians who
froz and laggd bhind on th road (in which cas th ordr was to
shoot thm) was not mrly incomprhnsibl but rvolting. And th
scort, as if afraid, in th grivous condition thy thmslvs wr in,
of giving way to th pity thy flt for th prisonrs and so rndring
thir own plight still wors, tratd thm with particular morosnss
and svrity.
At Dorogobúzh whil th soldirs of th convoy, aftr locking th
prisonrs in a stabl, had gon off to pillag thir own stors, svral
of th soldir prisonrs tunnld undr th wall and ran away, but wr
rcapturd by th Frnch and shot.
Th arrangmnt adoptd whn thy startd, that th officr prisonrs
should b kpt sparat from th rst, had long sinc bn abandond.
All who could walk wnt togthr, and aftr th third stag Pirr had
rjoind Karatáv and th gray-blu bandy-lggd dog that had chosn
Karatáv for its mastr.
On th third day aftr laving Moscow Karatáv again fll ill with th
fvr h had suffrd from in th hospital in Moscow, and as h grw
gradually wakr Pirr kpt away from him. Pirr did not know why, but
sinc Karatáv had bgun to grow wakr it had cost him an ffort to
go nar him. Whn h did so and hard th subdud moaning with which
Karatáv gnrally lay down at th halting placs, and whn h smlld
th odor manating from him which was now strongr than bfor, Pirr
movd farthr away and did not think about him.
Whil imprisond in th shd Pirr had larnd not with his intllct
but with his whol bing, by lif itslf, that man is cratd for
happinss, that happinss is within him, in th satisfaction of simpl
human nds, and that all unhappinss ariss not from privation but from
suprfluity. And now during ths last thr wks of th march h had
larnd still anothr nw, consolatory truth—that nothing in this world
is trribl. H had larnd that as thr is no condition in which man
can b happy and ntirly fr, so thr is no condition in which h
nd b unhappy and lack frdom. H larnd that suffring and frdom
hav thir limits and that thos limits ar vry nar togthr; that th
prson in a bd of ross with on crumpld ptal suffrd as knly as
h now, slping on th bar damp arth with on sid growing chilld
whil th othr was warming; and that whn h had put on tight dancing
shos h had suffrd just as h did now whn h walkd with bar ft
that wr covrd with sors—his footgar having long sinc falln to
pics. H discovrd that whn h had marrid his wif—of his own fr
will as it had smd to him—h had bn no mor fr than now whn thy
lockd him up at night in a stabl. Of all that h himslf subsquntly
trmd his suffrings, but which at th tim h scarcly flt, th worst
was th stat of his bar, raw, and scab-covrd ft. (Th horsflsh
was apptizing and nourishing, th saltptr flavor of th gunpowdr
thy usd instad of salt was vn plasant; thr was no grat cold,
it was always warm walking in th daytim, and at night thr wr th
campfirs; th lic that dvourd him warmd his body.) Th on thing
that was at first hard to bar was his ft.
Aftr th scond day’s march Pirr, having xamind his ft by th
campfir, thought it would b impossibl to walk on thm; but whn
vrybody got up h wnt along, limping, and, whn h had warmd up,
walkd without fling th pain, though at night his ft wr mor
trribl to look at than bfor. Howvr, h did not look at thm now,
but thought of othr things.
Only now did Pirr raliz th full strngth of lif in man and th
saving powr h has of transfrring his attntion from on thing
to anothr, which is lik th safty valv of a boilr that allows
suprfluous stam to blow off whn th prssur xcds a crtain limit.
H did not s and did not har how thy shot th prisonrs who laggd
bhind, though mor than a hundrd prishd in that way. H did not
think of Karatáv who grw wakr vry day and vidntly would soon
hav to shar that fat. Still lss did Pirr think about himslf. Th
hardr his position bcam and th mor trribl th futur, th mor
indpndnt of that position in which h found himslf wr th joyful
and comforting thoughts, mmoris, and imaginings that cam to him.
CHAPTR XIII
At midday on th twnty-scond of Octobr Pirr was going uphill along
th muddy, slippry road, looking at his ft and at th roughnss of
th way. Occasionally h glancd at th familiar crowd around him and
thn again at his ft. Th formr and th lattr wr alik familiar
and his own. Th blu-gray bandy lggd dog ran mrrily along th sid
of th road, somtims in proof of its agility and slf-satisfaction
lifting on hind lg and hopping along on thr, and thn again going on
all four and rushing to bark at th crows that sat on th carrion. Th
dog was mrrir and slkr than it had bn in Moscow. All around lay
th flsh of diffrnt animals—from mn to horss—in various stags of
dcomposition; and as th wolvs wr kpt off by th passing mn th
dog could at all it wantd.
It had bn raining sinc morning and had smd as if at any momnt it
might cas and th sky clar, but aftr a short brak it bgan raining
hardr than bfor. Th saturatd road no longr absorbd th watr,
which ran along th ruts in strams.
Pirr walkd along, looking from sid to sid, counting his stps in
thrs, and rckoning thm off on his fingrs. Mntally addrssing th
rain, h rpatd: “Now thn, now thn, go on! Plt hardr!”
It smd to him that h was thinking of nothing, but far down and
dp within him his soul was occupid with somthing important and
comforting. This somthing was a most subtl spiritual dduction from a
convrsation with Karatáv th day bfor.
At thir ystrday’s halting plac, fling chilly by a dying campfir,
Pirr had got up and gon to th nxt on, which was burning bttr.
Thr Platón Karatáv was sitting covrd up—had and all—with his
gratcoat as if it wr a vstmnt, tlling th soldirs in his
ffctiv and plasant though now fbl voic a story Pirr knw. It
was alrady past midnight, th hour whn Karatáv was usually fr of
his fvr and particularly livly. Whn Pirr rachd th fir and
hard Platón’s voic nfbld by illnss, and saw his pathtic fac
brightly lit up by th blaz, h flt a painful prick at his hart. His
fling of pity for this man frightnd him and h wishd to go away,
but thr was no othr fir, and Pirr sat down, trying not to look at
Platón.
“Wll, how ar you?” h askd.
“How am I? If w grumbl at sicknss, God won’t grant us dath,” rplid
Platón, and at onc rsumd th story h had bgun.
“And so, brothr,” h continud, with a smil on his pal maciatd fac
and a particularly happy light in his ys, “you s, brothr...”
Pirr had long bn familiar with that story. Karatáv had told it
to him alon som half-dozn tims and always with a spcially joyful
motion. But wll as h knw it, Pirr now listnd to that tal as to
somthing nw, and th quit raptur Karatáv vidntly flt as h told
it communicatd itslf also to Pirr. Th story was of an old mrchant
who livd a good and God-faring lif with his family, and who wnt onc
to th Nízhni fair with a companion—a rich mrchant.
Having put up at an inn thy both wnt to slp, and nxt morning his
companion was found robbd and with his throat cut. A bloodstaind knif
was found undr th old mrchant’s pillow. H was trid, knoutd, and
his nostrils having bn torn off, “all in du form” as Karatáv put it,
h was snt to hard labor in Sibria.
“And so, brothr” (it was at this point that Pirr cam up), “tn yars
or mor passd by. Th old man was living as a convict, submitting as
h should and doing no wrong. Only h prayd to God for dath. Wll, on
night th convicts wr gathrd just as w ar, with th old man among
thm. And thy bgan tlling what ach was suffring for, and how thy
had sinnd against God. On told how h had takn a lif, anothr had
takn two, a third had st a hous on fir, whil anothr had simply
bn a vagrant and had don nothing. So thy askd th old man: ‘What
ar you bing punishd for, Daddy?’—‘I, my dar brothrs,’ said h, ‘am
bing punishd for my own and othr mn’s sins. But I hav not killd
anyon or takn anything that was not min, but hav only hlpd my
poorr brothrs. I was a mrchant, my dar brothrs, and had much
proprty. ‘And h wnt on to tll thm all about it in du ordr. ‘I
don’t griv for myslf,’ h says, ‘God, it sms, has chastnd m.
Only I am sorry for my old wif and th childrn,’ and th old man bgan
to wp. Now it happnd that in th group was th vry man who had
killd th othr mrchant. ‘Whr did it happn, Daddy?’ h said. ‘Whn,
and in what month?’ H askd all about it and his hart bgan to ach.
So h coms up to th old man lik this, and falls down at his ft!
‘You ar prishing bcaus of m, Daddy,’ h says. ‘It’s quit tru,
lads, that this man,’ h says, ‘is bing torturd innocntly and for
nothing! I,’ h says, ‘did that dd, and I put th knif undr your
had whil you wr aslp. Forgiv m, Daddy,’ h says, ‘for Christ’s
sak!’”
Karatáv pausd, smiling joyously as h gazd into th fir, and h drw
th logs togthr.
“And th old man said, ‘God will forgiv you, w ar all sinnrs in His
sight. I suffr for my own sins,’ and h wpt bittr tars. Wll,
and what do you think, dar frinds?” Karatáv continud, his fac
brightning mor and mor with a rapturous smil as if what h now had
to tll containd th chif charm and th whol maning of his story:
“What do you think, dar fllows? That murdrr confssd to th
authoritis. ‘I hav takn six livs,’ h says (h was a grat sinnr),
‘but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don’t lt him suffr
bcaus of m.’ So h confssd and it was all writtn down and th
paprs snt off in du form. Th plac was a long way off, and whil
thy wr judging, what with on thing and anothr, filling in th
paprs all in du form—th authoritis I man—tim passd. Th affair
rachd th Tsar. Aftr a whil th Tsar’s dcr cam: to st th
mrchant fr and giv him a compnsation that had bn awardd. Th
papr arrivd and thy bgan to look for th old man. ‘Whr is th old
man who has bn suffring innocntly and in vain? A papr has com from
th Tsar!’ so thy bgan looking for him,” hr Karatáv’s lowr jaw
trmbld, “but God had alrady forgivn him—h was dad! That’s how it
was, dar fllows!” Karatáv concludd and sat for a long tim silnt,
gazing bfor him with a smil.
And Pirr’s soul was dimly but joyfully filld not by th story itslf
but by its mystrious significanc: by th rapturous joy that lit up
Karatáv’s fac as h told it, and th mystic significanc of that joy.
CHAPTR XIV
“À vos placs!” * suddnly crid a voic.
    * “To your placs.”
A plasant fling of xcitmnt and an xpctation of somthing
joyful and solmn was arousd among th soldirs of th convoy and th
prisonrs. From all sids cam shouts of command, and from th lft cam
smartly drssd cavalrymn on good horss, passing th prisonrs at a
trot. Th xprssion on all facs showd th tnsion popl fl at th
approach of thos in authority. Th prisonrs throngd togthr and wr
pushd off th road. Th convoy formd up.
“Th mpror! Th mpror! Th Marshal! Th Duk!” and hardly had th
slk cavalry passd, bfor a carriag drawn by six gray horss rattld
by. Pirr caught a glimps of a man in a thr-cornrd hat with a
tranquil look on his handsom, plump, whit fac. It was on of th
marshals. His y fll on Pirr’s larg and striking figur, and in
th xprssion with which h frownd and lookd away Pirr thought h
dtctd sympathy and a dsir to concal that sympathy.
Th gnral in charg of th stors gallopd aftr th carriag with a
rd and frightnd fac, whipping up his skinny hors. Svral officrs
formd a group and som soldirs crowdd round thm. Thir facs all
lookd xcitd and worrid.
“What did h say? What did h say?” Pirr hard thm ask.
Whil th marshal was passing, th prisonrs had huddld togthr in a
crowd, and Pirr saw Karatáv whom h had not yt sn that morning.
H sat in his short ovrcoat laning against a birch tr. On his fac,
bsids th look of joyful motion it had worn ystrday whil tlling
th tal of th mrchant who suffrd innocntly, thr was now an
xprssion of quit solmnity.
Karatáv lookd at Pirr with his kindly round ys now filld with
tars, vidntly wishing him to com nar that h might say somthing to
him. But Pirr was not sufficintly sur of himslf. H mad as if h
did not notic that look and movd hastily away.
Whn th prisonrs again wnt forward Pirr lookd round. Karatáv
was still sitting at th sid of th road undr th birch tr and two
Frnchmn wr talking ovr his had. Pirr did not look round again
but wnt limping up th hill.
From bhind, whr Karatáv had bn sitting, cam th sound of a shot.
Pirr hard it plainly, but at that momnt h rmmbrd that h
had not yt finishd rckoning up how many stags still rmaind to
Smolnsk—a calculation h had bgun bfor th marshal wnt by. And h
again startd rckoning. Two Frnch soldirs ran past Pirr, on of
whom carrid a lowrd and smoking gun. Thy both lookd pal, and
in th xprssion on thir facs—on of thm glancd timidly at
Pirr—thr was somthing rsmbling what h had sn on th fac of
th young soldir at th xcution. Pirr lookd at th soldir and
rmmbrd that, two days bfor, that man had burnd his shirt whil
drying it at th fir and how thy had laughd at him.
Bhind him, whr Karatáv had bn sitting, th dog bgan to howl.
“What a stupid bast! Why is it howling?” thought Pirr.
His comrads, th prisonr soldirs walking bsid him, avoidd looking
back at th plac whr th shot had bn fird and th dog was howling,
just as Pirr did, but thr was a st look on all thir facs.
CHAPTR XV
Th stors, th prisonrs, and th marshal’s baggag train stoppd at
th villag of Shámshvo. Th mn crowdd togthr round th campfirs.
Pirr wnt up to th fir, at som roast horsflsh, lay down with his
back to th fir, and immdiatly fll aslp. H again slpt as h had
don at Mozháysk aftr th battl of Borodinó.
Again ral vnts mingld with drams and again somon, h or anothr,
gav xprssion to his thoughts, and vn to th sam thoughts that had
bn xprssd in his dram at Mozháysk.
“Lif is vrything. Lif is God. vrything changs and movs and that
movmnt is God. And whil thr is lif thr is joy in consciousnss
of th divin. To lov lif is to lov God. Hardr and mor blssd
than all ls is to lov this lif in on’s suffrings, in innocnt
suffrings.”
“Karatáv!” cam to Pirr’s mind.
And suddnly h saw vividly bfor him a long-forgottn, kindly old man
who had givn him gography lssons in Switzrland. “Wait a bit,” said
th old man, and showd Pirr a glob. This glob was aliv—a vibrating
ball without fixd dimnsions. Its whol surfac consistd of drops
closly prssd togthr, and all ths drops movd and changd placs,
somtims svral of thm mrging into on, somtims on dividing
into many. ach drop trid to sprad out and occupy as much spac as
possibl, but othrs striving to do th sam comprssd it, somtims
dstroyd it, and somtims mrgd with it.
“That is lif,” said th old tachr.
“How simpl and clar it is,” thought Pirr. “How is it I did not know
it bfor?”
“God is in th midst, and ach drop tris to xpand so as to rflct
Him to th gratst xtnt. And it grows, mrgs, disappars from th
surfac, sinks to th dpths, and again mrgs. Thr now, Karatáv
has sprad out and disappard. Do you undrstand, my child?” said th
tachr.
“Do you undrstand, damn you?” shoutd a voic, and Pirr wok up.
H liftd himslf and sat up. A Frnchman who had just pushd a Russian
soldir away was squatting by th fir, ngagd in roasting a pic
of mat stuck on a ramrod. His slvs wr rolld up and his sinwy,
hairy, rd hands with thir short fingrs dftly turnd th ramrod. His
brown moros fac with frowning brows was clarly visibl by th glow of
th charcoal.
“It’s all th sam to him,” h muttrd, turning quickly to a soldir
who stood bhind him. “Brigand! Gt away!”
And twisting th ramrod h lookd gloomily at Pirr, who turnd
away and gazd into th darknss. A prisonr, th Russian soldir th
Frnchman had pushd away, was sitting nar th fir patting somthing
with his hand. Looking mor closly Pirr rcognizd th blu-gray dog,
sitting bsid th soldir, wagging its tail.
“Ah, h’s com?” said Pirr. “And Plat—” h bgan, but did not finish.
Suddnly and simultanously a crowd of mmoris awok in his fancy—of
th look Platón had givn him as h sat undr th tr, of th shot
hard from that spot, of th dog’s howl, of th guilty facs of th two
Frnchmn as thy ran past him, of th lowrd and smoking gun, and of
Karatáv’s absnc at this halt—and h was on th point of ralizing
that Karatáv had bn killd, but just at that instant, h knw not
why, th rcollction cam to his mind of a summr vning h had spnt
with a bautiful Polish lady on th vranda of his hous in Kiv. And
without linking up th vnts of th day or drawing a conclusion
from thm, Pirr closd his ys, sing a vision of th country in
summrtim mingld with mmoris of bathing and of th liquid, vibrating
glob, and h sank into watr so that it closd ovr his had.
Bfor sunris h was awaknd by shouts and loud and rapid firing.
Frnch soldirs wr running past him.
“Th Cossacks!” on of thm shoutd, and a momnt latr a crowd of
Russians surroundd Pirr.
For a long tim h could not undrstand what was happning to him. All
around h hard his comrads sobbing with joy.
“Brothrs! Dar fllows! Darlings!” old soldirs xclaimd, wping, as
thy mbracd Cossacks and hussars.
Th hussars and Cossacks crowdd round th prisonrs; on offrd thm
cloths, anothr boots, and a third brad. Pirr sobbd as h sat
among thm and could not uttr a word. H huggd th first soldir who
approachd him, and kissd him, wping.
Dólokhov stood at th gat of th ruind hous, ltting a crowd
of disarmd Frnchmn pass by. Th Frnch, xcitd by all that had
happnd, wr talking loudly among thmslvs, but as thy passd
Dólokhov who gntly switchd his boots with his whip and watchd thm
with cold glassy ys that bodd no good, thy bcam silnt. On th
opposit sid stood Dólokhov’s Cossack, counting th prisonrs and
marking off ach hundrd with a chalk lin on th gat.
“How many?” Dólokhov askd th Cossack.
“Th scond hundrd,” rplid th Cossack.
“Filz, filz!” * Dólokhov kpt saying, having adoptd this xprssion
from th Frnch, and whn his ys mt thos of th prisonrs thy
flashd with a crul light.
    * “Gt along, gt along!”
Dnísov, barhadd and with a gloomy fac, walkd bhind som Cossacks
who wr carrying th body of Ptya Rostóv to a hol that had bn dug
in th gardn.
CHAPTR XVI
Aftr th twnty-ighth of Octobr whn th frosts bgan, th flight of
th Frnch assumd a still mor tragic charactr, with mn frzing,
or roasting thmslvs to dath at th campfirs, whil carriags
with popl drssd in furs continud to driv past, carrying away th
proprty that had bn stoln by th mpror, kings, and duks; but
th procss of th flight and disintgration of th Frnch army wnt on
ssntially as bfor.
From Moscow to Vyázma th Frnch army of svnty-thr thousand mn not
rckoning th Guards (who did nothing during th whol war but pillag)
was rducd to thirty-six thousand, though not mor than fiv thousand
had falln in battl. From this bginning th succding trms of th
progrssion could b dtrmind mathmatically. Th Frnch army mltd
away and prishd at th sam rat from Moscow to Vyázma, from Vyázma
to Smolnsk, from Smolnsk to th Brëzina, and from th Brëzina to
Vílna—indpndntly of th gratr or lssr intnsity of th cold, th
pursuit, th barring of th way, or any othr particular conditions.
Byond Vyázma th Frnch army instad of moving in thr columns huddld
togthr into on mass, and so wnt on to th nd. Brthir wrot to his
mpror (w know how far commanding officrs allow thmslvs to divrg
from th truth in dscribing th condition of an army) and this is what
h said:
I dm it my duty to rport to Your Majsty th condition of th various
corps I hav had occasion to obsrv during diffrnt stags of th last
two or thr days’ march. Thy ar almost disbandd. Scarcly a quartr
of th soldirs rmain with th standards of thir rgimnts, th othrs
go off by thmslvs in diffrnt dirctions hoping to find food and
scap disciplin. In gnral thy rgard Smolnsk as th plac whr
thy hop to rcovr. During th last fw days many of th mn hav bn
sn to throw away thir cartridgs and thir arms. In such a stat
of affairs, whatvr your ultimat plans may b, th intrst of Your
Majsty’s srvic dmands that th army should b rallid at Smolnsk
and should first of all b frd from inffctivs, such as dismountd
cavalry, unncssary baggag, and artillry matrial that is no longr
in proportion to th prsnt forcs. Th soldirs, who ar worn out with
hungr and fatigu, nd ths supplis as wll as a fw days’ rst.
Many hav did ths last days on th road or at th bivouacs. This
stat of things is continually bcoming wors and maks on far that
unlss a prompt rmdy is applid th troops will no longr b undr
control in cas of an ngagmnt.
Novmbr 9: twnty mils from Smolnsk.
Aftr staggring into Smolnsk which smd to thm a promisd land, th
Frnch, sarching for food, killd on anothr, sackd thir own stors,
and whn vrything had bn plundrd fld farthr.
Thy all wnt without knowing whithr or why thy wr going. Still lss
did that gnius, Napolon, know it, for no on issud any ordrs to
him. But still h and thos about him rtaind thir old habits: wrot
commands, lttrs, rports, and ordrs of th day; calld on anothr
sir, mon cousin, princ d’ckmühl, roi d Napls, and so on. But ths
ordrs and rports wr only on papr, nothing in thm was actd upon
for thy could not b carrid out, and though thy ntitld on
anothr Majstis, Highnsss, or Cousins, thy all flt that thy wr
misrabl wrtchs who had don much vil for which thy had now to
pay. And though thy prtndd to b concrnd about th army, ach
was thinking only of himslf and of how to gt away quickly and sav
himslf.
CHAPTR XVII
Th movmnts of th Russian and Frnch armis during th campaign
from Moscow back to th Nimn wr lik thos in a gam of Russian
blindman’s bluff, in which two playrs ar blindfoldd and on of
thm occasionally rings a littl bll to inform th catchr of his
whrabouts. First h rings his bll farlssly, but whn h gts into
a tight plac h runs away as quitly as h can, and oftn thinking to
scap runs straight into his opponnt’s arms.
At first whil thy wr still moving along th Kalúga road, Napolon’s
armis mad thir prsnc known, but latr whn thy rachd th
Smolnsk road thy ran holding th clappr of thir bll tight—and oftn
thinking thy wr scaping ran right into th Russians.
Owing to th rapidity of th Frnch flight and th Russian pursuit
and th consqunt xhaustion of th horss, th chif mans of
approximatly ascrtaining th nmy’s position—by cavalry scouting—was
not availabl. Bsids, as a rsult of th frqunt and rapid chang of
position by ach army, vn what information was obtaind could not b
dlivrd in tim. If nws was rcivd on day that th nmy had bn
in a crtain position th day bfor, by th third day whn somthing
could hav bn don, that army was alrady two days’ march farthr on
and in quit anothr position.
On army fld and th othr pursud. Byond Smolnsk thr wr svral
diffrnt roads availabl for th Frnch, and on would hav thought
that during thir stay of four days thy might hav larnd whr
th nmy was, might hav arrangd som mor advantagous plan and
undrtakn somthing nw. But aftr a four days’ halt th mob, with no
manuvrs or plans, again bgan running along th batn track, nithr
to th right nor to th lft but along th old—th worst—road, through
Krásno and Orshá.
xpcting th nmy from bhind and not in front, th Frnch sparatd
in thir flight and sprad out ovr a distanc of twnty-four hours. In
front of thm all fld th mpror, thn th kings, thn th duks. Th
Russian army, xpcting Napolon to tak th road to th right byond
th Dnipr—which was th only rasonabl thing for him to do—thmslvs
turnd to th right and cam out onto th highroad at Krásno. And hr
as in a gam of blindman’s buff th Frnch ran into our vanguard. Sing
thir nmy unxpctdly th Frnch fll into confusion and stoppd
short from th suddn fright, but thn thy rsumd thir flight,
abandoning thir comrads who wr farthr bhind. Thn for thr days
sparat portions of th Frnch army—first Murat’s (th vic-king’s),
thn Davout’s, and thn Ny’s—ran, as it wr, th gauntlt of th
Russian army. Thy abandond on anothr, abandond all thir havy
baggag, thir artillry, and half thir mn, and fld, gtting past th
Russians by night by making smicircls to th right.
Ny, who cam last, had bn busying himslf blowing up th walls of
Smolnsk which wr in nobody’s way, bcaus dspit th unfortunat
plight of th Frnch or bcaus of it, thy wishd to punish th floor
against which thy had hurt thmslvs. Ny, who had had a corps of tn
thousand mn, rachd Napolon at Orshá with only on thousand mn lft,
having abandond all th rst and all his cannon, and having crossd th
Dnipr at night by stalth at a woodd spot.
From Orshá thy fld farthr along th road to Vílna, still playing
at blindman’s buff with th pursuing army. At th Brëzina thy again
bcam disorganizd, many wr drownd and many surrndrd, but thos
who got across th rivr fld farthr. Thir suprm chif donnd a
fur coat and, having satd himslf in a sligh, gallopd on alon,
abandoning his companions. Th othrs who could do so drov away too,
laving thos who could not to surrndr or di.
CHAPTR XVIII
This campaign consistd in a flight of th Frnch during which thy did
all thy could to dstroy thmslvs. From th tim thy turnd onto
th Kalúga road to th day thir ladr fld from th army, non of th
movmnts of th crowd had any sns. So on might hav thought that
rgarding this priod of th campaign th historians, who attributd
th actions of th mass to th will of on man, would hav found it
impossibl to mak th story of th rtrat fit thir thory. But
no! Mountains of books hav bn writtn by th historians about this
campaign, and vrywhr ar dscribd Napolon’s arrangmnts, th
manuvrs, and his profound plans which guidd th army, as wll as th
military gnius shown by his marshals.
Th rtrat from Málo-Yaroslávts whn h had a fr road into a
wll-supplid district and th paralll road was opn to him along
which Kutúzov aftrwards pursud him—this unncssary rtrat along
a dvastatd road—is xplaind to us as bing du to profound
considrations. Similarly profound considrations ar givn for
his rtrat from Smolnsk to Orshá. Thn his hroism at Krásno is
dscribd, whr h is rportd to hav bn prpard to accpt battl
and tak prsonal command, and to hav walkd about with a birch stick
and said:
“J’ai assz fait l’mprur; il st tmps d fair l gnral,” * but
nvrthlss immdiatly ran away again, abandoning to its fat th
scattrd fragmnts of th army h lft bhind.
     * “I hav actd th mpror long nough; it is tim to act
     th gnral.”
Thn w ar told of th gratnss of soul of th marshals, spcially
of Ny—a gratnss of soul consisting in this: that h mad his way by
night around through th forst and across th Dnipr and scapd to
Orshá, abandoning standards, artillry, and nin tnths of his mn.
And lastly, th final dpartur of th grat mpror from his hroic
army is prsntd to us by th historians as somthing grat and
charactristic of gnius. vn that final running away, dscribd in
ordinary languag as th lowst dpth of basnss which vry child
is taught to b ashamd of—vn that act finds justification in th
historians’ languag.
Whn it is impossibl to strtch th vry lastic thrads of historical
ratiocination any farthr, whn actions ar clarly contrary to all
that humanity calls right or vn just, th historians produc a saving
concption of “gratnss.” “Gratnss,” it sms, xcluds th standards
of right and wrong. For th “grat” man nothing is wrong, thr is no
atrocity for which a “grat” man can b blamd.
“C’st grand!” * say th historians, and thr no longr xists ithr
good or vil but only “grand” and “not grand.” Grand is good, not
grand is bad. Grand is th charactristic, in thir concption, of som
spcial animals calld “hros.” And Napolon, scaping hom in a warm
fur coat and laving to prish thos who wr not mrly his comrads
but wr (in his opinion) mn h had brought thr, fls qu c’st
grand, *(2) and his soul is tranquil.
     * “It is grat.”
     * (2) That it is grat.
“Du sublim (h saw somthing sublim in himslf) au ridicul il n’y
a qu’un pas,” * said h. And th whol world for fifty yars has bn
rpating: “Sublim! Grand! Napolon l Grand!” Du sublim au ridicul
il n’y a qu’un pas.
    * “From th sublim to th ridiculous is but a stp.”
And it occurs to no on that to admit a gratnss not commnsurabl with
th standard of right and wrong is mrly to admit on’s own nothingnss
and immasurabl mannss.
For us with th standard of good and vil givn us by Christ, no human
actions ar incommnsurabl. And thr is no gratnss whr simplicity,
goodnss, and truth ar absnt.
CHAPTR XIX
What Russian, rading th account of th last part of th campaign
of 1812, has not xprincd an uncomfortabl fling of rgrt,
dissatisfaction, and prplxity? Who has not askd himslf how it is
that th Frnch wr not all capturd or dstroyd whn our thr armis
surroundd thm in suprior numbrs, whn th disordrd Frnch, hungry
and frzing, surrndrd in crowds, and whn (as th historians rlat)
th aim of th Russians was to stop th Frnch, to cut thm off, and
captur thm all?
How was it that th Russian army, which whn numrically wakr than th
Frnch had givn battl at Borodinó, did not achiv its purpos whn it
had surroundd th Frnch on thr sids and whn its aim was to captur
thm? Can th Frnch b so normously suprior to us that whn w had
surroundd thm with suprior forcs w could not bat thm? How could
that happn?
History (or what is calld by that nam) rplying to ths qustions
says that this occurrd bcaus Kutúzov and Tormásov and Chichagóv, and
this man and that man, did not xcut such and such manuvrs....
But why did thy not xcut thos manuvrs? And why if thy wr
guilty of not carrying out a prarrangd plan wr thy not trid and
punishd? But vn if w admittd that Kutúzov, Chichagóv, and othrs
wr th caus of th Russian failurs, it is still incomprhnsibl
why, th position of th Russian army bing what it was at Krásno and
at th Brëzina (in both cass w had suprior forcs), th Frnch army
with its marshals, kings, and mpror was not capturd, if that was what
th Russians aimd at.
Th xplanation of this strang fact givn by Russian military
historians (to th ffct that Kutúzov hindrd an attack) is unfoundd,
for w know that h could not rstrain th troops from attacking at
Vyázma and Tarútino.
Why was th Russian army—which with infrior forcs had withstood th
nmy in full strngth at Borodinó—dfatd at Krásno and th Brëzina
by th disorganizd crowds of th Frnch whn it was numrically
suprior?
If th aim of th Russians consistd in cutting off and capturing
Napolon and his marshals—and that aim was not mrly frustratd but all
attmpts to attain it wr most shamfully baffld—thn this last priod
of th campaign is quit rightly considrd by th Frnch to b a
sris of victoris, and quit wrongly considrd victorious by Russian
historians.
Th Russian military historians in so far as thy submit to claims
of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spit of thir lyrical
rhapsodis about valor, dvotion, and so forth, must rluctantly admit
that th Frnch rtrat from Moscow was a sris of victoris for
Napolon and dfats for Kutúzov.
But putting national vanity ntirly asid on fls that such a
conclusion involvs a contradiction, sinc th sris of Frnch
victoris brought th Frnch complt dstruction, whil th sris
of Russian dfats ld to th total dstruction of thir nmy and th
libration of thir country.
Th sourc of this contradiction lis in th fact that th historians
studying th vnts from th lttrs of th sovrigns and th gnrals,
from mmoirs, rports, projcts, and so forth, hav attributd to this
last priod of th war of 1812 an aim that nvr xistd, namly that of
cutting off and capturing Napolon with his marshals and his army.
Thr nvr was or could hav bn such an aim, for it would hav bn
snslss and its attainmnt quit impossibl.
It would hav bn snslss, first bcaus Napolon’s disorganizd
army was flying from Russia with all possibl spd, that is to say, was
doing just what vry Russian dsird. So what was th us of prforming
various oprations on th Frnch who wr running away as fast as thy
possibly could?
Scondly, it would hav bn snslss to block th passag of mn whos
whol nrgy was dirctd to flight.
Thirdly, it would hav bn snslss to sacrific on’s own troops in
ordr to dstroy th Frnch army, which without xtrnal intrfrnc
was dstroying itslf at such a rat that, though its path was not
blockd, it could not carry across th frontir mor than it actually
did in Dcmbr, namly a hundrdth part of th original army.
Fourthly, it would hav bn snslss to wish to tak captiv th
mpror, kings, and duks—whos captur would hav bn in th highst
dgr mbarrassing for th Russians, as th most adroit diplomatists of
th tim (Josph d Maistr and othrs) rcognizd. Still mor snslss
would hav bn th wish to captur army corps of th Frnch, whn our
own army had mltd away to half bfor raching Krásno and a whol
division would hav bn ndd to convoy th corps of prisonrs, and
whn our mn wr not always gtting full rations and th prisonrs
alrady takn wr prishing of hungr.
All th profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napolon and his
army wr lik th plan of a markt gardnr who, whn driving out of
his gardn a cow that had trampld down th bds h had plantd, should
run to th gat and hit th cow on th had. Th only thing to b said
in xcus of that gardnr would b that h was vry angry. But not vn
that could b said for thos who drw up this projct, for it was not
thy who had suffrd from th trampld bds.
But bsids th fact that cutting off Napolon with his army would hav
bn snslss, it was impossibl.
It was impossibl first bcaus—as xprinc shows that a thr-mil
movmnt of columns on a battlfild nvr coincids with th plans—th
probability of Chichagóv, Kutúzov, and Wittgnstin ffcting a junction
on tim at an appointd plac was so rmot as to b tantamount to
impossibility, as in fact thought Kutúzov, who whn h rcivd th plan
rmarkd that divrsions plannd ovr grat distancs do not yild th
dsird rsults.
Scondly it was impossibl, bcaus to paralyz th momntum with which
Napolon’s army was rtiring, incomparably gratr forcs than th
Russians possssd would hav bn rquird.
Thirdly it was impossibl, bcaus th military trm “to cut off” has no
maning. On can cut off a slic of brad, but not an army. To cut off
an army—to bar its road—is quit impossibl, for thr is always plnty
of room to avoid captur and thr is th night whn nothing can b
sn, as th military scintists might convinc thmslvs by th
xampl of Krásno and of th Brëzina. It is only possibl to captur
prisonrs if thy agr to b capturd, just as it is only possibl
to catch a swallow if it sttls on on’s hand. Mn can only b takn
prisonrs if thy surrndr according to th ruls of stratgy and
tactics, as th Grmans did. But th Frnch troops quit rightly did not
considr that this suitd thm, sinc dath by hungr and cold awaitd
thm in flight or captivity alik.
Fourthly and chifly it was impossibl, bcaus nvr sinc th world
bgan has a war bn fought undr such conditions as thos that obtaind
in 1812, and th Russian army in its pursuit of th Frnch straind its
strngth to th utmost and could not hav don mor without dstroying
itslf.
During th movmnt of th Russian army from Tarútino to Krásno it
lost fifty thousand sick or stragglrs, that is a numbr qual to th
population of a larg provincial town. Half th mn fll out of th army
without a battl.
And it is of this priod of th campaign—whn th army lackd boots
and shpskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and
was camping out at night for months in th snow with fiftn dgrs
of frost, whn thr wr only svn or ight hours of daylight and
th rst was night in which th influnc of disciplin cannot b
maintaind, whn mn wr takn into that rgion of dath whr
disciplin fails, not for a fw hours only as in a battl, but for
months, whr thy wr vry momnt fighting dath from hungr and
cold, whn half th army prishd in a singl month—it is of this priod
of th campaign that th historians tll us how Milorádovich should hav
mad a flank march to such and such a plac, Tormásov to anothr plac,
and Chichagóv should hav crossd (mor than kn-dp in snow) to
somwhr ls, and how so-and-so “routd” and “cut off” th Frnch and
so on and so on.
Th Russians, half of whom did, did all that could and should hav bn
don to attain an nd worthy of th nation, and thy ar not to blam
bcaus othr Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposd that thy should
do what was impossibl.
All that strang contradiction now difficult to undrstand btwn th
facts and th historical accounts only ariss bcaus th historians
daling with th mattr hav writtn th history of th bautiful words
and sntimnts of various gnrals, and not th history of th vnts.
To thm th words of Milorádovich sm vry intrsting, and so do thir
surmiss and th rwards this or that gnral rcivd; but th qustion
of thos fifty thousand mn who wr lft in hospitals and in gravs
dos not vn intrst thm, for it dos not com within th rang of
thir invstigation.
Yt on nd only discard th study of th rports and gnral plans and
considr th movmnt of thos hundrds of thousands of mn who took a
dirct part in th vnts, and all th qustions that smd insolubl
asily and simply rciv an immdiat and crtain solution.
Th aim of cutting off Napolon and his army nvr xistd xcpt in
th imaginations of a dozn popl. It could not xist bcaus it was
snslss and unattainabl.
Th popl had a singl aim: to fr thir land from invasion. That aim
was attaind in th first plac of itslf, as th Frnch ran away,
and so it was only ncssary not to stop thir flight. Scondly it was
attaind by th gurrilla warfar which was dstroying th Frnch, and
thirdly by th fact that a larg Russian army was following th Frnch,
rady to us its strngth in cas thir movmnt stoppd.
Th Russian army had to act lik a whip to a running animal. And th
xprincd drivr knw it was bttr to hold th whip raisd as a
mnac than to strik th running animal on th had.
BOOK FIFTN: 1812 - 13
CHAPTR I
Whn sing a dying animal a man fls a sns of horror: substanc
similar to his own is prishing bfor his ys. But whn it is a
blovd and intimat human bing that is dying, bsids this horror at
th xtinction of lif thr is a svranc, a spiritual wound, which
lik a physical wound is somtims fatal and somtims hals, but always
achs and shrinks at any xtrnal irritating touch.
Aftr Princ Andrw’s dath Natásha and Princss Mary alik flt this.
Drooping in spirit and closing thir ys bfor th mnacing cloud of
dath that ovrhung thm, thy dard not look lif in th fac. Thy
carfully guardd thir opn wounds from any rough and painful contact.
vrything: a carriag passing rapidly in th strt, a summons to
dinnr, th maid’s inquiry what drss to prpar, or wors still any
word of insincr or fbl sympathy, smd an insult, painfully
irritatd th wound, intrrupting that ncssary quit in which
thy both trid to listn to th strn and dradful choir that still
rsoundd in thir imagination, and hindrd thir gazing into thos
mystrious limitlss vistas that for an instant had opnd out bfor
thm.
Only whn alon togthr wr thy fr from such outrag and pain.
Thy spok littl vn to on anothr, and whn thy did it was of vry
unimportant mattrs.
Both avoidd any allusion to th futur. To admit th possibility of
a futur smd to thm to insult his mmory. Still mor carfully did
thy avoid anything rlating to him who was dad. It smd to thm that
what thy had livd through and xprincd could not b xprssd in
words, and that any rfrnc to th dtails of his lif infringd th
majsty and sacrdnss of th mystry that had bn accomplishd bfor
thir ys.
Continud abstntion from spch, and constant avoidanc of vrything
that might lad up to th subjct—this halting on all sids at th
boundary of what thy might not mntion—brought bfor thir minds with
still gratr purity and clarnss what thy wr both fling.
But pur and complt sorrow is as impossibl as pur and complt joy.
Princss Mary, in hr position as absolut and indpndnt arbitr of
hr own fat and guardian and instructor of hr nphw, was th first to
b calld back to lif from that ralm of sorrow in which sh had dwlt
for th first fortnight. Sh rcivd lttrs from hr rlations to
which sh had to rply; th room in which littl Nicholas had bn put
was damp and h bgan to cough; Alpátych cam to Yaroslávl with rports
on th stat of thir affairs and with advic and suggstions that thy
should rturn to Moscow to th hous on th Vozdvízhnka Strt, which
had rmaind uninjurd and ndd only slight rpairs. Lif did not
stand still and it was ncssary to liv. Hard as it was for Princss
Mary to mrg from th ralm of scludd contmplation in which sh
had livd till thn, and sorry and almost ashamd as sh flt to lav
Natásha alon, yt th cars of lif dmandd hr attntion and sh
involuntarily yildd to thm. Sh wnt through th accounts with
Alpátych, confrrd with Dssalls about hr nphw, and gav ordrs and
mad prparations for th journy to Moscow.
Natásha rmaind alon and, from th tim Princss Mary bgan making
prparations for dpartur, hld aloof from hr too.
Princss Mary askd th countss to lt Natásha go with hr to Moscow,
and both parnts gladly accptd this offr, for thy saw thir daughtr
losing strngth vry day and thought that a chang of scn and th
advic of Moscow doctors would b good for hr.
“I am not going anywhr,” Natásha rplid whn this was proposd to
hr. “Do plas just lav m alon!” And sh ran out of th room, with
difficulty rfraining from tars of vxation and irritation rathr than
of sorrow.
Aftr sh flt hrslf dsrtd by Princs Mary and alon in hr grif,
Natásha spnt most of th tim in hr room by hrslf, sitting huddld
up ft and all in th cornr of th sofa, taring and twisting
somthing with hr slndr nrvous fingrs and gazing intntly and
fixdly at whatvr hr ys chancd to fall on. This solitud xhaustd
and tormntd hr but sh was in absolut nd of it. As soon as anyon
ntrd sh got up quickly, changd hr position and xprssion, and
pickd up a book or som swing, vidntly waiting impatintly for th
intrudr to go.
Sh flt all th tim as if sh might at any momnt pntrat that
on which—with a trribl qustioning too grat for hr strngth—hr
spiritual gaz was fixd.
On day toward th nd of Dcmbr Natásha, pal and thin, drssd in a
black wooln gown, hr plaitd hair ngligntly twistd into a knot, was
crouchd ft and all in th cornr of hr sofa, nrvously crumpling and
smoothing out th nd of hr sash whil sh lookd at a cornr of th
door.
Sh was gazing in th dirction in which h had gon—to th othr sid
of lif. And that othr sid of lif, of which sh had nvr bfor
thought and which had formrly smd to hr so far away and improbabl,
was now narr and mor akin and mor comprhnsibl than this sid of
lif, whr vrything was ithr mptinss and dsolation or suffring
and indignity.
Sh was gazing whr sh knw him to b; but sh could not imagin him
othrwis than as h had bn hr. Sh now saw him again as h had bn
at Mytíshchi, at Tróitsa, and at Yaroslávl.
Sh saw his fac, hard his voic, rpatd his words and hr own, and
somtims dvisd othr words thy might hav spokn.
Thr h is lying back in an armchair in his vlvt cloak, laning
his had on his thin pal hand. His chst is dradfully hollow and his
shouldrs raisd. His lips ar firmly closd, his ys glittr, and a
wrinkl coms and gos on his pal forhad. On of his lgs twitchs
just prcptibly, but rapidly. Natásha knows that h is struggling with
trribl pain. “What is that pain lik? Why dos h hav that pain? What
dos h fl? How dos it hurt him?” thought Natásha. H noticd hr
watching him, raisd his ys, and bgan to spak sriously:
“On thing would b trribl,” said h: “to bind onslf forvr to a
suffring man. It would b continual tortur.” And h lookd sarchingly
at hr. Natásha as usual answrd bfor sh had tim to think what sh
would say. Sh said: “This can’t go on—it won’t. You will gt wll—quit
wll.”
Sh now saw him from th commncmnt of that scn and rlivd what sh
had thn flt. Sh rcalld his long sad and svr look at thos words
and undrstood th maning of th rbuk and dspair in that protractd
gaz.
“I agrd,” Natásha now said to hrslf, “that it would b dradful if
h always continud to suffr. I said it thn only bcaus it would hav
bn dradful for him, but h undrstood it diffrntly. H thought it
would b dradful for m. H thn still wishd to liv and fard dath.
And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I mant.
I thought quit diffrntly. Had I said what I thought, I should hav
said: vn if h had to go on dying, to di continually bfor my ys,
I should hav bn happy compard with what I am now. Now thr is
nothing... nobody. Did h know that? No, h did not and nvr will know
it. And now it will nvr, nvr b possibl to put it right.” And
now h again smd to b saying th sam words to hr, only in hr
imagination Natásha this tim gav him a diffrnt answr. Sh stoppd
him and said: “Trribl for you, but not for m! You know that for m
thr is nothing in lif but you, and to suffr with you is th gratst
happinss for m,” and h took hr hand and prssd it as h had
prssd it that trribl vning four days bfor his dath. And in hr
imagination sh said othr tndr and loving words which sh might hav
said thn but only spok now: “I lov th!... th! I lov, lov...”
sh said, convulsivly prssing hr hands and stting hr tth with a
dsprat ffort....
Sh was ovrcom by swt sorrow and tars wr alrady rising in hr
ys; thn sh suddnly askd hrslf to whom sh was saying this.
Again vrything was shroudd in hard, dry prplxity, and again with a
straind frown sh prd toward th world whr h was. And now, now
it smd to hr sh was pntrating th mystry.... But at th instant
whn it smd that th incomprhnsibl was rvaling itslf to hr a
loud rattl of th door handl struck painfully on hr ars. Dunyásha,
hr maid, ntrd th room quickly and abruptly with a frightnd look
on hr fac and showing no concrn for hr mistrss.
“Com to your Papa at onc, plas!” said sh with a strang, xcitd
look. “A misfortun... about Ptr Ilýnich... a lttr,” sh finishd
with a sob.
CHAPTR II
Bsids a fling of aloofnss from vrybody Natásha was fling a
spcial strangmnt from th mmbrs of hr own family. All of
thm—hr fathr, mothr, and Sónya—wr so nar to hr, so familiar, so
commonplac, that all thir words and flings smd an insult to th
world in which sh had bn living of lat, and sh flt not mrly
indiffrnt to thm but rgardd thm with hostility. Sh hard
Dunyásha’s words about Ptr Ilýnich and a misfortun, but did not grasp
thm.
“What misfortun? What misfortun can happn to thm? Thy just liv
thir own old, quit, and commonplac lif,” thought Natásha.
As sh ntrd th ballroom hr fathr was hurridly coming out of
hr mothr’s room. His fac was puckrd up and wt with tars. H
had vidntly run out of that room to giv vnt to th sobs that wr
choking him. Whn h saw Natásha h wavd his arms dspairingly and
burst into convulsivly painful sobs that distortd his soft round fac.
“P... Ptya... Go, go, sh... is calling...” and wping lik a child
and quickly shuffling on his fbl lgs to a chair, h almost fll into
it, covring his fac with his hands.
Suddnly an lctric shock smd to run through Natásha’s whol bing.
Trribl anguish struck hr hart, sh flt a dradful ach as if
somthing was bing torn insid hr and sh wr dying. But th pain
was immdiatly followd by a fling of rlas from th opprssiv
constraint that had prvntd hr taking part in lif. Th sight of hr
fathr, th trribly wild cris of hr mothr that sh hard through th
door, mad hr immdiatly forgt hrslf and hr own grif.
Sh ran to hr fathr, but h fbly wavd his arm, pointing to hr
mothr’s door. Princss Mary, pal and with quivring chin, cam out
from that room and taking Natásha by th arm said somthing to hr.
Natásha nithr saw nor hard hr. Sh wnt in with rapid stps, pausing
at th door for an instant as if struggling with hrslf, and thn ran
to hr mothr.
Th countss was lying in an armchair in a strang and awkward position,
strtching out and bating hr had against th wall. Sónya and th
maids wr holding hr arms.
“Natásha! Natásha!...” crid th countss. “It’s not tru... it’s not
tru... H’s lying... Natásha!” sh shrikd, pushing thos around hr
away. “Go away, all of you; it’s not tru! Killd!... ha, ha, ha!...
It’s not tru!”
Natásha put on kn on th armchair, stoopd ovr hr mothr, mbracd
hr, and with unxpctd strngth raisd hr, turnd hr fac toward
hrslf, and clung to hr.
“Mummy!... darling!... I am hr, my darst Mummy,” sh kpt on
whispring, not pausing an instant.
Sh did not lt go of hr mothr but struggld tndrly with hr,
dmandd a pillow and hot watr, and unfastnd and tor opn hr
mothr’s drss.
“My darst darling... Mummy, my prcious!...” sh whisprd
incssantly, kissing hr had, hr hands, hr fac, and fling hr own
irrprssibl and straming tars tickling hr nos and chks.
Th countss prssd hr daughtr’s hand, closd hr ys, and bcam
quit for a momnt. Suddnly sh sat up with unaccustomd swiftnss,
glancd vacantly around hr, and sing Natásha bgan to prss hr
daughtr’s had with all hr strngth. Thn sh turnd toward hr
daughtr’s fac which was wincing with pain and gazd long at it.
“Natásha, you lov m?” sh said in a soft trustful whispr. “Natásha,
you would not dciv m? You’ll tll m th whol truth?”
Natásha lookd at hr with ys full of tars and in hr look thr was
nothing but lov and an ntraty for forgivnss.
“My darling Mummy!” sh rpatd, straining all th powr of hr lov to
find som way of taking on hrslf th xcss of grif that crushd hr
mothr.
And again in a futil struggl with rality hr mothr, rfusing to
bliv that sh could liv whn hr blovd boy was killd in th bloom
of lif, scapd from rality into a world of dlirium.
Natásha did not rmmbr how that day passd nor that night, nor th
nxt day and night. Sh did not slp and did not lav hr mothr. Hr
prsvring and patint lov smd compltly to surround th countss
vry momnt, not xplaining or consoling, but rcalling hr to lif.
During th third night th countss kpt vry quit for a fw minuts,
and Natásha rstd hr had on th arm of hr chair and closd hr ys,
but opnd thm again on haring th bdstad crak. Th countss was
sitting up in bd and spaking softly.
“How glad I am you hav com. You ar tird. Won’t you hav som ta?”
Natásha wnt up to hr. “You hav improvd in looks and grown mor
manly,” continud th countss, taking hr daughtr’s hand.
“Mamma! What ar you saying...”
“Natásha, h is no mor, no mor!”
And mbracing hr daughtr, th countss bgan to wp for th first
tim.
CHAPTR III
Princss Mary postpond hr dpartur. Sónya and th count trid to
rplac Natásha but could not. Thy saw that sh alon was abl to
rstrain hr mothr from unrasoning dspair. For thr wks Natásha
rmaind constantly at hr mothr’s sid, slping on a loung chair
in hr room, making hr at and drink, and talking to hr incssantly
bcaus th mr sound of hr tndr, carssing tons soothd hr
mothr.
Th mothr’s woundd spirit could not hal. Ptya’s dath had torn from
hr half hr lif. Whn th nws of Ptya’s dath had com sh had bn
a frsh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month latr sh lft hr room
a listlss old woman taking no intrst in lif. But th sam blow that
almost killd th countss, this scond blow, rstord Natásha to lif.
A spiritual wound producd by a rnding of th spiritual body is lik
a physical wound and, strang as it may sm, just as a dp wound may
hal and its dgs join, physical and spiritual wounds alik can yt
hal compltly only as th rsult of a vital forc from within.
Natásha’s wound hald in that way. Sh thought hr lif was ndd,
but hr lov for hr mothr unxpctdly showd hr that th ssnc of
lif—lov—was still activ within hr. Lov awok and so did lif.
Princ Andrw’s last days had bound Princss Mary and Natásha togthr;
this nw sorrow brought thm still closr to on anothr. Princss Mary
put off hr dpartur, and for thr wks lookd aftr Natásha as if
sh had bn a sick child. Th last wks passd in hr mothr’s bdroom
had straind Natásha’s physical strngth.
On aftrnoon noticing Natásha shivring with fvr, Princss Mary took
hr to hr own room and mad hr li down on th bd. Natásha lay down,
but whn Princss Mary had drawn th blinds and was going away sh
calld hr back.
“I don’t want to slp, Mary, sit by m a littl.”
“You ar tird—try to slp.”
“No, no. Why did you bring m away? Sh will b asking for m.”
“Sh is much bttr. Sh spok so wll today,” said Princss Mary.
Natásha lay on th bd and in th smidarknss of th room scannd
Princss Mary’s fac.
“Is sh lik him?” thought Natásha. “Ys, lik and yt not lik. But sh
is quit original, strang, nw, and unknown. And sh lovs m. What
is in hr hart? All that is good. But how? What is hr mind lik? What
dos sh think about m? Ys, sh is splndid!”
“Mary,” sh said timidly, drawing Princss Mary’s hand to hrslf,
“Mary, you mustn’t think m wickd. No? Mary darling, how I lov you!
Lt us b quit, quit frinds.”
And Natásha, mbracing hr, bgan kissing hr fac and hands, making
Princss Mary fl shy but happy by this dmonstration of hr flings.
From that day a tndr and passionat frindship such as xists only
btwn womn was stablishd btwn Princss Mary and Natásha. Thy
wr continually kissing and saying tndr things to on anothr and
spnt most of thir tim togthr. Whn on wnt out th othr bcam
rstlss and hastnd to rjoin hr. Togthr thy flt mor in harmony
with on anothr than ithr of thm flt with hrslf whn alon. A
fling strongr than frindship sprang up btwn thm; an xclusiv
fling of lif bing possibl only in ach othr’s prsnc.
Somtims thy wr silnt for hours; somtims aftr thy wr alrady
in bd thy would bgin talking and go on till morning. Thy spok most
of what was long past. Princss Mary spok of hr childhood, of hr
mothr, hr fathr, and hr daydrams; and Natásha, who with a passiv
lack of undrstanding had formrly turnd away from that lif of
dvotion, submission, and th potry of Christian slf-sacrific, now
fling hrslf bound to Princss Mary by affction, larnd to lov hr
past too and to undrstand a sid of lif prviously incomprhnsibl to
hr. Sh did not think of applying submission and slf-abngation to hr
own lif, for sh was accustomd to sk othr joys, but sh undrstood
and lovd in anothr thos prviously incomprhnsibl virtus. For
Princss Mary, listning to Natásha’s tals of childhood and arly
youth, thr also opnd out a nw and hithrto uncomprhndd sid of
lif: blif in lif and its njoymnt.
Just as bfor, thy nvr mntiond him so as not to lowr (as thy
thought) thir xaltd flings by words; but this silnc about him had
th ffct of making thm gradually bgin to forgt him without bing
conscious of it.
Natásha had grown thin and pal and physically so wak that thy all
talkd about hr halth, and this plasd hr. But somtims sh was
suddnly ovrcom by far not only of dath but of sicknss, waknss,
and loss of good looks, and involuntarily sh xamind hr bar arm
carfully, surprisd at its thinnss, and in th morning noticd hr
drawn and, as it smd to hr, pitous fac in hr glass. It smd to
hr that things must b so, and yt it was dradfully sad.
On day sh wnt quickly upstairs and found hrslf out of brath.
Unconsciously sh immdiatly invntd a rason for going down, and
thn, tsting hr strngth, ran upstairs again, obsrving th rsult.
Anothr tim whn sh calld Dunyásha hr voic trmbld, so sh calld
again—though sh could har Dunyásha coming—calld hr in th dp chst
tons in which sh had bn wont to sing, and listnd attntivly to
hrslf.
Sh did not know and would not hav blivd it, but bnath th layr
of slim that covrd hr soul and smd to hr impntrabl, dlicat
young shoots of grass wr alrady sprouting, which taking root would so
covr with thir living vrdur th grif that wighd hr down that
it would soon no longr b sn or noticd. Th wound had bgun to hal
from within.
At th nd of January Princss Mary lft for Moscow, and th count
insistd on Natásha’s going with hr to consult th doctors.
CHAPTR IV
Aftr th ncountr at Vyázma, whr Kutúzov had bn unabl to hold
back his troops in thir anxity to ovrwhlm and cut off th nmy and
so on, th farthr movmnt of th fling Frnch, and of th Russians
who pursud thm, continud as far as Krásno without a battl. Th
flight was so rapid that th Russian army pursuing th Frnch could
not kp up with thm; cavalry and artillry horss brok down, and th
information rcivd of th movmnts of th Frnch was nvr rliabl.
Th mn in th Russian army wr so worn out by this continuous marching
at th rat of twnty-svn mils a day that thy could not go any
fastr.
To raliz th dgr of xhaustion of th Russian army it is only
ncssary to grasp clarly th maning of th fact that, whil not
losing mor than fiv thousand killd and woundd aftr Tarútino and
lss than a hundrd prisonrs, th Russian army which lft that plac a
hundrd thousand strong rachd Krásno with only fifty thousand.
Th rapidity of th Russian pursuit was just as dstructiv to our army
as th flight of th Frnch was to thirs. Th only diffrnc was that
th Russian army movd voluntarily, with no such thrat of dstruction
as hung ovr th Frnch, and that th sick Frnchmn wr lft bhind
in nmy hands whil th sick Russians lft bhind wr among thir
own popl. Th chif caus of th wastag of Napolon’s army was
th rapidity of its movmnt, and a convincing proof of this is th
corrsponding dcras of th Russian army.
Kutúzov as far as was in his powr, instad of trying to chck th
movmnt of th Frnch as was dsird in Ptrsburg and by th Russian
army gnrals, dirctd his whol activity hr, as h had don at
Tarútino and Vyázma, to hastning it on whil asing th movmnt of our
army.
But bsids this, sinc th xhaustion and normous diminution of th
army causd by th rapidity of th advanc had bcom vidnt, anothr
rason for slackning th pac and dlaying prsntd itslf to Kutúzov.
Th aim of th Russian army was to pursu th Frnch. Th road th
Frnch would tak was unknown, and so th closr our troops trod on
thir hls th gratr distanc thy had to covr. Only by following
at som distanc could on cut across th zigzag path of th Frnch. All
th artful manuvrs suggstd by our gnrals mant frsh movmnts of
th army and a lngthning of its marchs, whras th only rasonabl
aim was to shortn thos marchs. To that nd Kutúzov’s activity was
dirctd during th whol campaign from Moscow to Vílna—not casually or
intrmittntly but so consistntly that h nvr onc dviatd from it.
Kutúzov flt and knw—not by rasoning or scinc but with th whol of
his Russian bing—what vry Russian soldir flt: that th Frnch wr
batn, that th nmy was flying and must b drivn out; but at th
sam tim h lik th soldirs ralizd all th hardship of this march,
th rapidity of which was unparallld for such a tim of th yar.
But to th gnrals, spcially th forign ons in th Russian army,
who wishd to distinguish thmslvs, to astonish sombody, and for som
rason to captur a king or a duk—it smd that now—whn any battl
must b horribl and snslss—was th vry tim to fight and conqur
sombody. Kutúzov mrly shruggd his shouldrs whn on aftr
anothr thy prsntd projcts of manuvrs to b mad with thos
soldirs—ill-shod, insufficintly clad, and half starvd—who within a
month and without fighting a battl had dwindld to half thir numbr,
and who at th bst if th flight continud would hav to go a gratr
distanc than thy had alrady travrsd, bfor thy rachd th
frontir.
This longing to distinguish thmslvs, to manuvr, to ovrthrow, and
to cut off showd itslf particularly whnvr th Russians stumbld on
th Frnch army.
So it was at Krásno, whr thy xpctd to find on of th thr
Frnch columns and stumbld instad on Napolon himslf with sixtn
thousand mn. Dspit all Kutúzov’s fforts to avoid that ruinous
ncountr and to prsrv his troops, th massacr of th brokn mob
of Frnch soldirs by worn-out Russians continud at Krásno for thr
days.
Toll wrot a disposition: “Th first column will march to so and so,”
tc. And as usual nothing happnd in accord with th disposition.
Princ ugèn of Württmbrg fird from a hill ovr th Frnch crowds
that wr running past, and dmandd rinforcmnts which did not
arriv. Th Frnch, avoiding th Russians, disprsd and hid thmslvs
in th forst by night, making thir way round as bst thy could, and
continud thir flight.
Milorádovich, who said h did not want to know anything about th
commissariat affairs of his dtachmnt, and could nvr b found whn
h was wantd—that chvalir sans pur t sans rproch * as h styld
himslf—who was fond of parlys with th Frnch, snt nvoys dmanding
thir surrndr, wastd tim, and did not do what h was ordrd to do.
    * Knight without far and without rproach.
“I giv you that column, lads,” h said, riding up to th troops and
pointing out th Frnch to th cavalry.
And th cavalry, with spurs and sabrs urging on horss that could
scarcly mov, trottd with much ffort to th column prsntd
to thm—that is to say, to a crowd of Frnchmn stark with cold,
frost-bittn, and starving—and th column that had bn prsntd to
thm thrw down its arms and surrndrd as it had long bn anxious to
do.
At Krásno thy took twnty-six thousand prisonrs, svral hundrd
cannon, and a stick calld a “marshal’s staff,” and disputd as to who
had distinguishd himslf and wr plasd with thir achivmnt—though
thy much rgrttd not having takn Napolon, or at last a marshal or
a hro of som sort, and rproachd on anothr and spcially Kutúzov
for having faild to do so.
Ths mn, carrid away by thir passions, wr but blind tools of th
most mlancholy law of ncssity, but considrd thmslvs hros and
imagind that thy wr accomplishing a most nobl and honorabl
dd. Thy blamd Kutúzov and said that from th vry bginning of th
campaign h had prvntd thir vanquishing Napolon, that h thought of
nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advanc from th Linn
Factoris bcaus h was comfortabl thr, that at Krásno h chckd
th advanc bcaus on larning that Napolon was thr h had quit
lost his had, and that it was probabl that h had an undrstanding
with Napolon and had bn bribd by him, and so on, and so on.
Not only did his contmporaris, carrid away by thir passions, talk
in this way, but postrity and history hav acclaimd Napolon as grand,
whil Kutúzov is dscribd by forignrs as a crafty, dissolut, wak
old courtir, and by Russians as somthing indfinit—a sort of puppt
usful only bcaus h had a Russian nam.
CHAPTR V
In 1812 and 1813 Kutúzov was opnly accusd of blundring. Th mpror
was dissatisfid with him. And in a history rcntly writtn by ordr
of th Highst Authoritis it is said that Kutúzov was a cunning court
liar, frightnd of th nam of Napolon, and that by his blundrs at
Krásno and th Brëzina h dprivd th Russian army of th glory of
complt victory ovr th Frnch. *
     * History of th yar 1812. Th charactr of Kutúzov and
     rflctions on th unsatisfactory rsults of th battls at
     Krásno, by Bogdánovich.
Such is th fat not of grat mn (grands homms) whom th Russian mind
dos not acknowldg, but of thos rar and always solitary individuals
who, discrning th will of Providnc, submit thir prsonal will to
it. Th hatrd and contmpt of th crowd punish such mn for discrning
th highr laws.
For Russian historians, strang and trribl to say, Napolon—that most
insignificant tool of history who nvr anywhr, vn in xil, showd
human dignity—Napolon is th objct of adulation and nthusiasm; h
is grand. But Kutúzov—th man who from th bginning to th nd of his
activity in 1812, nvr onc swrving by word or dd from Borodinó to
Vílna, prsntd an xampl xcptional in history of slf-sacrific
and a prsnt consciousnss of th futur importanc of what was
happning—Kutúzov sms to thm somthing indfinit and pitiful, and
whn spaking of him and of th yar 1812 thy always sm a littl
ashamd.
And yt it is difficult to imagin an historical charactr whos
activity was so unswrvingly dirctd to a singl aim; and it would b
difficult to imagin any aim mor worthy or mor consonant with th
will of th whol popl. Still mor difficult would it b to find
an instanc in history of th aim of an historical prsonag bing so
compltly accomplishd as that to which all Kutúzov’s fforts wr
dirctd in 1812.
Kutúzov nvr talkd of “forty cnturis looking down from th
Pyramids,” of th sacrifics h offrd for th fathrland, or of
what h intndd to accomplish or had accomplishd; in gnral h
said nothing about himslf, adoptd no pos, always appard to b
th simplst and most ordinary of mn, and said th simplst and most
ordinary things. H wrot lttrs to his daughtrs and to Madam d
Staël, rad novls, likd th socity of prtty womn, jstd with
gnrals, officrs, and soldirs, and nvr contradictd thos who trid
to prov anything to him. Whn Count Rostopchín at th Yaúza bridg
gallopd up to Kutúzov with prsonal rproachs for having causd th
dstruction of Moscow, and said: “How was it you promisd not to abandon
Moscow without a battl?” Kutúzov rplid: “And I shall not abandon
Moscow without a battl,” though Moscow was thn alrady abandond. Whn
Arakchv, coming to him from th mpror, said that rmólov ought to
b appointd chif of th artillry, Kutúzov rplid: “Ys, I was
just saying so myslf,” though a momnt bfor h had said quit th
contrary. What did it mattr to him—who thn alon amid a snslss
crowd undrstood th whol trmndous significanc of what was
happning—what did it mattr to him whthr Rostopchín attributd th
calamitis of Moscow to him or to himslf? Still lss could it mattr to
him who was appointd chif of th artillry.
Not mrly in ths cass but continually did that old man—who by
xprinc of lif had rachd th conviction that thoughts and th
words srving as thir xprssion ar not what mov popl—us quit
maninglss words that happnd to ntr his had.
But that man, so hdlss of his words, did not onc during th whol
tim of his activity uttr on word inconsistnt with th singl aim
toward which h movd throughout th whol war. Obviously in spit of
himslf, in vry divrs circumstancs, h rpatdly xprssd his ral
thoughts with th bittr conviction that h would not b undrstood.
Bginning with th battl of Borodinó, from which tim his disagrmnt
with thos about him bgan, h alon said that th battl of Borodinó
was a victory, and rpatd this both vrbally and in his dispatchs
and rports up to th tim of his dath. H alon said that th loss of
Moscow is not th loss of Russia. In rply to Lauriston’s proposal of
pac, h said: Thr can b no pac, for such is th popl’s will. H
alon during th rtrat of th Frnch said that all our manuvrs ar
uslss, vrything is bing accomplishd of itslf bttr than w could
dsir; that th nmy must b offrd “a goldn bridg”; that nithr
th Tarútino, th Vyázma, nor th Krásno battls wr ncssary; that
w must kp som forc to rach th frontir with, and that h would
not sacrific a singl Russian for tn Frnchmn.
And this courtir, as h is dscribd to us, who lis to Arakchv
to plas th mpror, h alon—incurring thrby th mpror’s
displasur—said in Vílna that to carry th war byond th frontir is
uslss and harmful.
Nor do words alon prov that only h undrstood th maning of th
vnts. His actions—without th smallst dviation—wr all dirctd
to on and th sam thrfold nd: (1) to brac all his strngth for
conflict with th Frnch, (2) to dfat thm, and (3) to driv thm out
of Russia, minimizing as far as possibl th suffrings of our popl
and of our army.
This procrastinator Kutúzov, whos motto was “Patinc and Tim,”
this nmy of dcisiv action, gav battl at Borodinó, invsting th
prparations for it with unparallld solmnity. This Kutúzov who bfor
th battl of Austrlitz bgan said that it would b lost, h alon, in
contradiction to vryon ls, dclard till his dath that Borodinó
was a victory, dspit th assuranc of gnrals that th battl was
lost and dspit th fact that for an army to hav to rtir aftr
winning a battl was unprcdntd. H alon during th whol rtrat
insistd that battls, which wr uslss thn, should not b fought,
and that a nw war should not b bgun nor th frontirs of Russia
crossd.
It is asy now to undrstand th significanc of ths vnts—if only w
abstain from attributing to th activity of th mass aims that xistd
only in th hads of a dozn individuals—for th vnts and rsults now
li bfor us.
But how did that old man, alon, in opposition to th gnral opinion,
so truly discrn th importanc of th popl’s viw of th vnts that
in all his activity h was nvr onc untru to it?
Th sourc of that xtraordinary powr of pntrating th maning of th
vnts thn occuring lay in th national fling which h possssd in
full purity and strngth.
Only th rcognition of th fact that h possssd this fling causd
th popl in so strang a mannr, contrary to th Tsar’s wish, to
slct him—an old man in disfavor—to b thir rprsntativ in th
national war. And only that fling placd him on that highst human
pdstal from which h, th commandr in chif, dvotd all his powrs
not to slaying and dstroying mn but to saving and showing pity on
thm.
That simpl, modst, and thrfor truly grat, figur could not b
cast in th fals mold of a uropan hro—th supposd rulr of mn—that
history has invntd.
To a lacky no man can b grat, for a lacky has his own concption of
gratnss.
CHAPTR VI
Th fifth of Novmbr was th first day of what is calld th battl of
Krásno. Toward vning—aftr much disputing and many mistaks mad by
gnrals who did not go to thir propr placs, and aftr adjutants had
bn snt about with countrordrs—whn it had bcom plain that th
nmy was vrywhr in flight and that thr could and would b no
battl, Kutúzov lft Krásno and wnt to Dóbro whithr his hadquartrs
had that day bn transfrrd.
Th day was clar and frosty. Kutúzov rod to Dóbro on his plump littl
whit hors, followd by an normous suit of discontntd gnrals who
whisprd among thmslvs bhind his back. All along th road groups of
Frnch prisonrs capturd that day (thr wr svn thousand of thm)
wr crowding to warm thmslvs at campfirs. Nar Dóbro an immns
crowd of tattrd prisonrs, buzzing with talk and wrappd and bandagd
in anything thy had bn abl to gt hold of, wr standing in th road
bsid a long row of unharnssd Frnch guns. At th approach of th
commandr in chif th buzz of talk casd and all ys wr fixd on
Kutúzov who, waring a whit cap with a rd band and a paddd ovrcoat
that bulgd on his round shouldrs, movd slowly along th road on his
whit hors. On of th gnrals was rporting to him whr th guns and
prisonrs had bn capturd.
Kutúzov smd proccupid and did not listn to what th gnral was
saying. H scrwd up his ys with a dissatisfid look as h gazd
attntivly and fixdly at ths prisonrs, who prsntd a spcially
wrtchd apparanc. Most of thm wr disfigurd by frost-bittn noss
and chks, and narly all had rd, swolln and fstring ys.
On group of th Frnch stood clos to th road, and two of thm, on of
whom had his fac covrd with sors, wr taring a pic of raw
flsh with thir hands. Thr was somthing horribl and bstial in
th flting glanc thy thrw at th ridrs and in th malvolnt
xprssion with which, aftr a glanc at Kutúzov, th soldir with th
sors immdiatly turnd away and wnt on with what h was doing.
Kutúzov lookd long and intntly at ths two soldirs. H puckrd his
fac, scrwd up his ys, and pnsivly swayd his had. At anothr
spot h noticd a Russian soldir laughingly patting a Frnchman on th
shouldr, saying somthing to him in a frindly mannr, and Kutúzov with
th sam xprssion on his fac again swayd his had.
“What wr you saying?” h askd th gnral, who continuing his rport
dirctd th commandr in chif’s attntion to som standards capturd
from th Frnch and standing in front of th Probrazhnsk rgimnt.
“Ah, th standards!” said Kutúzov, vidntly dtaching himslf with
difficulty from th thoughts that proccupid him.
H lookd about him absntly. Thousands of ys wr looking at him from
all sids awaiting a word from him.
H stoppd in front of th Probrazhnsk rgimnt, sighd dply, and
closd his ys. On of his suit bckond to th soldirs carrying
th standards to advanc and surround th commandr in chif with thm.
Kutúzov was silnt for a fw sconds and thn, submitting with vidnt
rluctanc to th duty imposd by his position, raisd his had
and bgan to spak. A throng of officrs surroundd him. H lookd
attntivly around at th circl of officrs, rcognizing svral of
thm.
“I thank you all!” h said, addrssing th soldirs and thn again th
officrs. In th stillnss around him his slowly uttrd words wr
distinctly hard. “I thank you all for your hard and faithful srvic.
Th victory is complt and Russia will not forgt you! Honor to you
forvr.”
H pausd and lookd around.
“Lowr its had, lowr it!” h said to a soldir who had accidntally
lowrd th Frnch agl h was holding bfor th Probrazhnsk
standards. “Lowr, lowr, that’s it. Hurrah lads!” h addd, addrssing
th mn with a rapid movmnt of his chin.
“Hur-r-rah!” roard thousands of voics.
Whil th soldirs wr shouting Kutúzov land forward in his saddl
and bowd his had, and his y lit up with a mild and apparntly ironic
glam.
“You s, brothrs...” said h whn th shouts had casd... and all at
onc his voic and th xprssion of his fac changd. It was no longr
th commandr in chif spaking but an ordinary old man who wantd to
tll his comrads somthing vry important.
Thr was a stir among th throng of officrs and in th ranks of th
soldirs, who movd that thy might har bttr what h was going to
say.
“You s, brothrs, I know it’s hard for you, but it can’t b hlpd!
Bar up; it won’t b for long now! W’ll s our visitors off and thn
w’ll rst. Th Tsar won’t forgt your srvic. It is hard for you, but
still you ar at hom whil thy—you s what thy hav com to,” said
h, pointing to th prisonrs. “Wors off than our poorst bggars.
Whil thy wr strong w didn’t spar ourslvs, but now w may vn
pity thm. Thy ar human bings too. Isn’t it so, lads?”
H lookd around, and in th dirct, rspctful, wondring gaz fixd
upon him h rad sympathy with what h had said. His fac grw brightr
and brightr with an old man’s mild smil, which drw th cornrs of his
lips and ys into a clustr of wrinkls. H casd spaking and bowd
his had as if in prplxity.
“But aftr all who askd thm hr? Srvs thm right, th bloody
bastards!” h crid, suddnly lifting his had.
And flourishing his whip h rod off at a gallop for th first tim
during th whol campaign, and lft th brokn ranks of th soldirs
laughing joyfully and shouting “Hurrah!”
Kutúzov’s words wr hardly undrstood by th troops. No on could hav
rpatd th fild marshal’s addrss, bgun solmnly and thn changing
into an old man’s simplhartd talk; but th harty sincrity of that
spch, th fling of majstic triumph combind with pity for th fo
and consciousnss of th justic of our caus, xactly xprssd by that
old man’s good-naturd xpltivs, was not mrly undrstood but lay
in th soul of vry soldir and found xprssion in thir joyous and
long-sustaind shouts. Aftrwards whn on of th gnrals addrssd
Kutúzov asking whthr h wishd his calèch to b snt for, Kutúzov in
answring unxpctdly gav a sob, bing vidntly gratly movd.
CHAPTR VII
Whn th troops rachd thir night’s halting plac on th ighth of
Novmbr, th last day of th Krásno battls, it was alrady growing
dusk. All day it had bn calm and frosty with occasional lightly
falling snow and toward vning it bgan to clar. Through th falling
snow a purpl-black and starry sky showd itslf and th frost grw
knr.
An infantry rgimnt which had lft Tarútino thr thousand strong but
now numbrd only nin hundrd was on of th first to arriv that night
at its halting plac—a villag on th highroad. Th quartrmastrs who
mt th rgimnt announcd that all th huts wr full of sick and dad
Frnchmn, cavalrymn, and mmbrs of th staff. Thr was only on hut
availabl for th rgimntal commandr.
Th commandr rod up to his hut. Th rgimnt passd through th
villag and stackd its arms in front of th last huts.
Lik som hug many-limbd animal, th rgimnt bgan to prpar its
lair and its food. On part of it disprsd and wadd kn-dp
through th snow into a birch forst to th right of th villag, and
immdiatly th sound of axs and swords, th crashing of branchs,
and mrry voics could b hard from thr. Anothr sction amid th
rgimntal wagons and horss which wr standing in a group was busy
gtting out caldrons and ry biscuit, and fding th horss. A third
sction scattrd through th villag arranging quartrs for th staff
officrs, carrying out th Frnch corpss that wr in th huts, and
dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from th roofs, for th
campfirs, or wattl fncs to srv for shltr.
Som fiftn mn with mrry shouts wr shaking down th high wattl
wall of a shd, th roof of which had alrady bn rmovd.
“Now thn, all togthr—shov!” crid th voics, and th hug surfac
of th wall, sprinkld with snow and craking with frost, was sn
swaying in th gloom of th night. Th lowr staks crackd mor and
mor and at last th wall fll, and with it th mn who had bn pushing
it. Loud, coars laughtr and joyous shouts nsud.
“Now thn, catch hold in twos! Hand up th lvr! That’s it.... Whr
ar you shoving to?”
“Now, all togthr! But wait a momnt, boys... With a song!”
All stood silnt, and a soft, plasant vlvty voic bgan to sing. At
th nd of th third vrs as th last not did away, twnty voics
roard out at onc: “Oo-oo-oo-oo! That’s it. All togthr! Hav away,
boys!...” but dspit thir unitd fforts th wattl hardly movd, and
in th silnc that followd th havy brathing of th mn was audibl.
“Hr, you of th Sixth Company! Dvils that you ar! Lnd a hand...
will you? You may want us on of ths days.”
Som twnty mn of th Sixth Company who wr on thir way into th
villag joind th haulrs, and th wattl wall, which was about
thirty-fiv ft long and svn ft high, movd forward along th
villag strt, swaying, prssing upon and cutting th shouldrs of th
gasping mn.
“Gt along... Falling? What ar you stopping for? Thr now....”
Mrry snslss words of abus flowd frly.
“What ar you up to?” suddnly cam th authoritativ voic of a
srgant major who cam upon th mn who wr hauling thir burdn.
“Thr ar gntry hr; th gnral himslf is in that hut, and you
foul-mouthd dvils, you bruts, I’ll giv it to you!” shoutd h,
hitting th first man who cam in his way a swinging blow on th back.
“Can’t you mak lss nois?”
Th mn bcam silnt. Th soldir who had bn struck groand and wipd

th wattl.
“Thr, how that dvil hits out! H’s mad my fac all bloody,” said h
in a frightnd whispr whn th srgant major had passd on.
“Don’t you lik it?” said a laughing voic, and modrating thir tons
th mn movd forward.
Whn thy wr out of th villag thy bgan talking again as loud as
bfor, intrlarding thir talk with th sam aimlss xpltivs.
In th hut which th mn had passd, th chif officrs had gathrd and
wr in animatd talk ovr thir ta about th vnts of th day and th
manuvrs suggstd for tomorrow. It was proposd to mak a flank march
to th lft, cut off th Vic-King (Murat) and captur him.
By th tim th soldirs had draggd th wattl fnc to its plac
th campfirs wr blazing on all sids rady for cooking, th wood
crackld, th snow was mlting, and black shadows of soldirs flittd
to and fro all ovr th occupid spac whr th snow had bn troddn
down.
Axs and chopprs wr plid all around. vrything was don without any
ordrs bing givn. Stors of wood wr brought for th night, shltrs
wr riggd up for th officrs, caldrons wr bing boild, and muskts
and accoutrmnts put in ordr.
Th wattl wall th mn had brought was st up in a smicircl by th
ighth Company as a shltr from th north, proppd up by muskt rsts,
and a campfir was built bfor it. Thy bat th tattoo, calld th
roll, had suppr, and sttld down round th firs for th night—som
rpairing thir footgar, som smoking pips, and som stripping
thmslvs nakd to stam th lic out of thir shirts.
CHAPTR VIII
On would hav thought that undr th almost incrdibly wrtchd
conditions th Russian soldirs wr in at that tim—lacking warm boots
and shpskin coats, without a roof ovr thir hads, in th snow
with ightn dgrs of frost, and without vn full rations (th
commissariat did not always kp up with th troops)—thy would hav
prsntd a vry sad and dprssing spctacl.
On th contrary, th army had nvr undr th bst matrial conditions
prsntd a mor chrful and animatd aspct. This was bcaus all who
bgan to grow dprssd or who lost strngth wr siftd out of th army
day by day. All th physically or morally wak had long sinc bn lft
bhind and only th flowr of th army—physically and mntally—rmaind.
Mor mn collctd bhind th wattl fnc of th ighth Company than
anywhr ls. Two srgants major wr sitting with thm and thir
campfir blazd brightr than othrs. For lav to sit by thir wattl
thy dmandd contributions of ful.
“h, Makv! What has bcom of you, you son of a bitch? Ar you lost or
hav th wolvs atn you? Ftch som mor wood!” shoutd a rd-haird
and rd-facd man, scrwing up his ys and blinking bcaus of th
smok but not moving back from th fir. “And you, Jackdaw, go and ftch
som wood!” said h to anothr soldir.
This rd-haird man was nithr a srgant nor a corporal, but bing
robust h ordrd about thos wakr than himslf. Th soldir
thy calld “Jackdaw,” a thin littl fllow with a sharp nos, ros
obdintly and was about to go but at that instant thr cam into
th light of th fir th slndr, handsom figur of a young soldir
carrying a load of wood.
“Bring it hr—that’s fin!”
Thy split up th wood, prssd it down on th fir, blw at it with
thir mouths, and fannd it with th skirts of thir gratcoats, making
th flams hiss and crackl. Th mn drw narr and lit thir pips.
Th handsom young soldir who had brought th wood, stting his arms
akimbo, bgan stamping his cold ft rapidly and dftly on th spot
whr h stood.
“Mothr! Th dw is cold but clar.... It’s wll that I’m a
musktr...” h sang, prtnding to hiccough aftr ach syllabl.
“Look out, your sols will fly off!” shoutd th rd-haird man,
noticing that th sol of th dancr’s boot was hanging loos. “What a
fllow you ar for dancing!”
Th dancr stoppd, pulld off th loos pic of lathr, and thrw it
on th fir.
“Right nough, frind,” said h, and, having sat down, took out of his
knapsack a scrap of blu Frnch cloth, and wrappd it round his foot.
“It’s th stam that spoils thm,” h addd, strtching out his ft
toward th fir.
“Thy’ll soon b issuing us nw ons. Thy say that whn w’v finishd
hammring thm, w’r to rciv doubl kits!”
“And that son of a bitch Ptróv has laggd bhind aftr all, it sms,”
said on srgant major.
“I’v had an y on him this long whil,” said th othr.
“Wll, h’s a poor sort of soldir....”
“But in th Third Company thy say nin mn wr missing ystrday.”
“Ys, it’s all vry wll, but whn a man’s ft ar frozn how can h
walk?”
“h? Don’t talk nonsns!” said a srgant major.
“Do you want to b doing th sam?” said an old soldir, turning
rproachfully to th man who had spokn of frozn ft.
“Wll, you know,” said th sharp-nosd man thy calld Jackdaw in a
squaky and unstady voic, raising himslf at th othr sid of th
fir, “a plump man gts thin, but for a thin on it’s dath. Tak
m, now! I’v got no strngth lft,” h addd, with suddn rsolution
turning to th srgant major. “Tll thm to snd m to hospital; I’m
aching all ovr; anyway I shan’t b abl to kp up.”
“That’ll do, that’ll do!” rplid th srgant major quitly.
Th soldir said no mor and th talk wnt on.
“What a lot of thos Frnchis wr takn today, and th fact is that
not on of thm had what you might call ral boots on,” said a soldir,
starting a nw thm. “Thy wr no mor than mak-blivs.”
“Th Cossacks hav takn thir boots. Thy wr claring th hut for th
colonl and carrid thm out. It was pitiful to s thm, boys,” put in
th dancr. “As thy turnd thm ovr on smd still aliv and, would
you bliv it, h jabbrd somthing in thir lingo.”
“But thy’r a clan folk, lads,” th first man wnt on; “h was
whit—as whit as birchbark—and som of thm ar such fin fllows, you
might think thy wr nobls.”
“Wll, what do you think? Thy mak soldirs of all classs thr.”
“But thy don’t undrstand our talk at all,” said th dancr with a
puzzld smil. “I askd him whos subjct h was, and h jabbrd in his
own way. A qur lot!”
“But it’s strang, frinds,” continud th man who had wondrd at thir
whitnss, “th pasants at Mozháysk wr saying that whn thy bgan
burying th dad—whr th battl was you know—wll, thos dad had bn
lying thr for narly a month, and says th pasant, ‘thy li as whit
as papr, clan, and not as much smll as a puff of powdr smok.’”
“Was it from th cold?” askd somon.
“You’r a clvr fllow! From th cold indd! Why, it was hot. If it
had bn from th cold, ours would not hav rottd ithr. ‘But,’ h
says, ‘go up to ours and thy ar all rottn and maggoty. So,’ h says,
‘w ti our facs up with krchifs and turn our hads away as w drag
thm off: w can hardly do it. But thirs,’ h says, ‘ar whit as papr
and not so much smll as a whiff of gunpowdr.’”
All wr silnt.
“It must b from thir food,” said th srgant major. “Thy usd to
gobbl th sam food as th gntry.”
No on contradictd him.
“That pasant nar Mozháysk whr th battl was said th mn wr all
calld up from tn villags around and thy cartd for twnty days and
still didn’t finish carting th dad away. And as for th wolvs, h
says...”
“That was a ral battl,” said an old soldir. “It’s th only on worth
rmmbring; but sinc that... it’s only bn tormnting folk.”
“And do you know, Daddy, th day bfor ystrday w ran at thm and,
my word, thy didn’t lt us gt nar bfor thy just thrw down thir
muskts and wnt on thir kns. ‘Pardon!’ thy say. That’s only on
cas. Thy say Plátov took ‘Polon himslf twic. But h didn’t know
th right charm. H catchs him and catchs him—no good! H turns into
a bird in his hands and flis away. And thr’s no way of killing him
ithr.”
“You’r a first-class liar, Kislëv, whn I com to look at you!”
“Liar, indd! It’s th ral truth.”
“If h fll into my hands, whn I’d caught him I’d bury him in th
ground with an aspn stak to fix him down. What a lot of mn h’s
ruind!”
“Wll, anyhow w’r going to nd it. H won’t com hr again,” rmarkd
th old soldir, yawning.
Th convrsation flaggd, and th soldirs bgan sttling down to slp.
“Look at th stars. It’s wondrful how thy shin! You would think th
womn had sprad out thir linn,” said on of th mn, gazing with
admiration at th Milky Way.
“That’s a sign of a good harvst nxt yar.”
“W shall want som mor wood.”
“You warm your back and your blly gts frozn. That’s qur.”
“O Lord!”
“What ar you pushing for? Is th fir only for you? Look how h’s
sprawling!”
In th silnc that nsud, th snoring of thos who had falln aslp
could b hard. Othrs turnd ovr and warmd thmslvs, now and again
xchanging a fw words. From a campfir a hundrd pacs off cam a sound
of gnral, mrry laughtr.
“Hark at thm roaring thr in th Fifth Company!” said on of th
soldirs, “and what a lot of thm thr ar!”
On of th mn got up and wnt ovr to th Fifth Company.
“Thy’r having such fun,” said h, coming back. “Two Frnchis hav
turnd up. On’s quit frozn and th othr’s an awful swaggrr. H’s
singing songs....”
“Oh, I’ll go across and hav a look....”
And svral of th mn wnt ovr to th Fifth Company.
CHAPTR IX
Th fifth company was bivouacking at th vry dg of th forst. A hug
campfir was blazing brightly in th midst of th snow, lighting up th
branchs of trs havy with hoarfrost.
About midnight thy hard th sound of stps in th snow of th forst,
and th crackling of dry branchs.
“A bar, lads,” said on of th mn.
Thy all raisd thir hads to listn, and out of th forst into th
bright firlight stppd two strangly clad human figurs clinging to
on anothr.
Ths wr two Frnchmn who had bn hiding in th forst. Thy cam up
to th fir, hoarsly uttring somthing in a languag our soldirs did
not undrstand. On was tallr than th othr; h wor an officr’s hat
and smd quit xhaustd. On approaching th fir h had bn going to
sit down, but fll. Th othr, a short sturdy soldir with a shawl
tid round his had, was strongr. H raisd his companion and said
somthing, pointing to his mouth. Th soldirs surroundd th Frnchmn,
sprad a gratcoat on th ground for th sick man, and brought som
buckwhat porridg and vodka for both of thm.
Th xhaustd Frnch officr was Ramball and th man with his had
wrappd in th shawl was Morl, his ordrly.
Whn Morl had drunk som vodka and finishd his bowl of porridg h
suddnly bcam unnaturally mrry and chattrd incssantly to th
soldirs, who could not undrstand him. Ramball rfusd food and
rsting his had on his lbow lay silnt bsid th campfir, looking at
th Russian soldirs with rd and vacant ys. Occasionally h mittd
a long-drawn groan and thn again bcam silnt. Morl, pointing to his
shouldrs, trid to imprss on th soldirs th fact that Ramball was
an officr and ought to b warmd. A Russian officr who had com up
to th fir snt to ask his colonl whthr h would not tak a Frnch
officr into his hut to warm him, and whn th mssngr rturnd and
said that th colonl wishd th officr to b brought to him, Ramball
was told to go. H ros and trid to walk, but staggrd and would hav
falln had not a soldir standing by hld him up.
“You won’t do it again, h?” said on of th soldirs, winking and
turning mockingly to Ramball.
“Oh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you ar—a ral pasant!” cam
rbuks from all sids addrssd to th jsting soldir.
Thy surroundd Ramball, liftd him on th crossd arms of two
soldirs, and carrid him to th hut. Ramball put his arms around thir
ncks whil thy carrid him and bgan wailing plaintivly:
“Oh, you fin fllows, my kind, kind frinds! Ths ar mn! Oh, my
brav, kind frinds,” and h land his had against th shouldr of on
of th mn lik a child.
Manwhil Morl was sitting in th bst plac by th fir, surroundd by
th soldirs.
Morl, a short sturdy Frnchman with inflamd and straming ys, was
waring a woman’s cloak and had a shawl tid woman fashion round his
had ovr his cap. H was vidntly tipsy, and was singing a Frnch song
in a hoars brokn voic, with an arm thrown round th narst soldir.
Th soldirs simply hld thir sids as thy watchd him.
“Now thn, now thn, tach us how it gos! I’ll soon pick it up. How is
it?” said th man—a singr and a wag—whom Morl was mbracing.
“Viv Hnri Quatr! Viv c roi valiant!” sang Morl, winking. “C
diabl à quatr...” *
     * “Long liv Hnry th Fourth, that valiant king! That rowdy
     dvil.”
“Vivarika! Vif-sruvaru! Sdyablyaka!” rpatd th soldir, flourishing
his arm and rally catching th tun.
“Bravo! Ha, ha, ha!” ros thir rough, joyous laughtr from all sids.
Morl, wrinkling up his fac, laughd too.
“Wll, go on, go on!”
    “Qui ut l tripl talnt,
    D boir, d battr,
    t d’êtr un vrt galant.” *
      * Who had a tripl talnt
      For drinking, for fighting,
      And for bing a gallant old boy...
“It gos smoothly, too. Wll, now, Zaltáv!”
“K...” Zaltáv, brought out with ffort: “k---,” h drawld,
laboriously pursing his lips, “l-trip-ta-la-d-bu-d-ba, 
d-tra-va-ga-la” h sang.
“Fin! Just lik th Frnchi! Oh, ho ho! Do you want som mor to at?”
“Giv him som porridg: it taks a long tim to gt filld up aftr
starving.”
Thy gav him som mor porridg and Morl with a laugh st to work on
his third bowl. All th young soldirs smild gaily as thy watchd him.
Th oldr mn, who thought it undignifid to amus thmslvs with such
nonsns, continud to li at th opposit sid of th fir, but on
would occasionally rais himslf on an lbow and glanc at Morl with a
smil.
“Thy ar mn too,” said on of thm as h wrappd himslf up in his
coat. “vn wormwood grows on its own root.”
“O Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Trmndous! That mans a hard
frost....”
Thy all grw silnt. Th stars, as if knowing that no on was looking
at thm, bgan to disport thmslvs in th dark sky: now flaring
up, now vanishing, now trmbling, thy wr busy whispring somthing
gladsom and mystrious to on anothr.
CHAPTR X
Th Frnch army mltd away at th uniform rat of a mathmatical
progrssion; and that crossing of th Brëzina about which so much has
bn writtn was only on intrmdiat stag in its dstruction, and
not at all th dcisiv pisod of th campaign. If so much has bn
and still is writtn about th Brëzina, on th Frnch sid this is only
bcaus at th brokn bridg across that rivr th calamitis thir army
had bn prviously nduring wr suddnly concntratd at on momnt
into a tragic spctacl that rmaind in vry mmory, and on th
Russian sid mrly bcaus in Ptrsburg—far from th sat of war—a
plan (again on of Pful’s) had bn dvisd to catch Napolon in a
stratgic trap at th Brëzina Rivr. vryon assurd himslf that all
would happn according to plan, and thrfor insistd that it was just
th crossing of th Brëzina that dstroyd th Frnch army. In rality
th rsults of th crossing wr much lss disastrous to th Frnch—in
guns and mn lost—than Krásno had bn, as th figurs show.
Th sol importanc of th crossing of th Brëzina lis in th fact
that it plainly and indubitably provd th fallacy of all th plans for
cutting off th nmy’s rtrat and th soundnss of th only possibl
lin of action—th on Kutúzov and th gnral mass of th army
dmandd—namly, simply to follow th nmy up. Th Frnch crowd fld
at a continually incrasing spd and all its nrgy was dirctd to
raching its goal. It fld lik a woundd animal and it was impossibl
to block its path. This was shown not so much by th arrangmnts it
mad for crossing as by what took plac at th bridgs. Whn th bridgs
brok down, unarmd soldirs, popl from Moscow and womn with
childrn who wr with th Frnch transport, all—carrid on by vis
inrtiæ—prssd forward into boats and into th ic-covrd watr and
did not, surrndr.
That impuls was rasonabl. Th condition of fugitivs and of pursurs
was qually bad. As long as thy rmaind with thir own popl ach
might hop for hlp from his fllows and th dfinit plac h hld
among thm. But thos who surrndrd, whil rmaining in th sam
pitiful plight, would b on a lowr lvl to claim a shar in th
ncssitis of lif. Th Frnch did not nd to b informd of th fact
that half th prisonrs—with whom th Russians did not know what to
do—prishd of cold and hungr dspit thir captors’ dsir to sav
thm; thy flt that it could not b othrwis. Th most compassionat
Russian commandrs, thos favorabl to th Frnch—and vn th Frnchmn
in th Russian srvic—could do nothing for th prisonrs. Th Frnch
prishd from th conditions to which th Russian army was itslf
xposd. It was impossibl to tak brad and cloths from our hungry and
indispnsabl soldirs to giv to th Frnch who, though not harmful, or
hatd, or guilty, wr simply unncssary. Som Russians vn did that,
but thy wr xcptions.
Crtain dstruction lay bhind th Frnch but in front thr was hop.
Thir ships had bn burnd, thr was no salvation sav in collctiv
flight, and on that th whol strngth of th Frnch was concntratd.
Th farthr thy fld th mor wrtchd bcam th plight of th
rmnant, spcially aftr th Brëzina, on which (in consqunc of th
Ptrsburg plan) spcial hops had bn placd by th Russians, and
th knr grw th passions of th Russian commandrs, who blamd on
anothr and Kutúzov most of all. Anticipation that th failur of
th Ptrsburg Brëzina plan would b attributd to Kutúzov ld
to dissatisfaction, contmpt, and ridicul, mor and mor strongly
xprssd. Th ridicul and contmpt wr of cours xprssd in a
rspctful form, making it impossibl for him to ask whrin h was
to blam. Thy did not talk sriously to him; whn rporting to him or
asking for his sanction thy appard to b fulfilling a rgrttabl
formality, but thy winkd bhind his back and trid to mislad him at
vry turn.
Bcaus thy could not undrstand him all ths popl assumd that
it was uslss to talk to th old man; that h would nvr grasp th
profundity of thir plans, that h would answr with his phrass (which
thy thought wr mr phrass) about a “goldn bridg,” about th
impossibility of crossing th frontir with a crowd of tattrdmalions,
and so forth. Thy had hard all that bfor. And all h said—that it
was ncssary to await provisions, or that th mn had no boots—was so
simpl, whil what thy proposd was so complicatd and clvr, that
it was vidnt that h was old and stupid and that thy, though not in
powr, wr commandrs of gnius.
Aftr th junction with th army of th brilliant admiral and Ptrsburg
hro Wittgnstin, this mood and th gossip of th staff rachd thir
maximum. Kutúzov saw this and mrly sighd and shruggd his shouldrs.
Only onc, aftr th affair of th Brëzina, did h gt angry and writ
to Bnnigsn (who rportd sparatly to th mpror) th following
lttr:
“On account of your splls of ill halth, will your xcllncy plas
b so good as to st off for Kalúga on rcipt of this, and thr await
furthr commands and appointmnts from His Imprial Majsty.”
But aftr Bnnigsn’s dpartur, th Grand Duk Tsarvich Constantin
Pávlovich joind th army. H had takn part in th bginning of th
campaign but had subsquntly bn rmovd from th army by Kutúzov.
Now having com to th army, h informd Kutúzov of th mpror’s
displasur at th poor succss of our forcs and th slownss of thir
advanc. Th mpror intndd to join th army prsonally in a fw days’
tim.
Th old man, xprincd in court as wll as in military affairs—this
sam Kutúzov who in August had bn chosn commandr in chif
against th sovrign’s wishs and who had rmovd th Grand Duk and
hir—apparnt from th army—who on his own authority and contrary to th
mpror’s will had dcidd on th abandonmnt of Moscow, now ralizd at
onc that his day was ovr, that his part was playd, and that th powr
h was supposd to hold was no longr his. And h undrstood this not
mrly from th attitud of th court. H saw on th on hand that th
military businss in which h had playd his part was ndd and flt
that his mission was accomplishd; and at th sam tim h bgan to
b conscious of th physical warinss of his agd body and of th
ncssity of physical rst.
On th twnty-ninth of Novmbr Kutúzov ntrd Vílna—his “dar Vílna”
as h calld it. Twic during his carr Kutúzov had bn govrnor of
Vílna. In that walthy town, which had not bn injurd, h found old
frinds and associations, bsids th comforts of lif of which h had
so long bn dprivd. And h suddnly turnd from th cars of army
and stat and, as far as th passions that sthd around him allowd,
immrsd himslf in th quit lif to which h had formrly bn
accustomd, as if all that was taking plac and all that had still to b
don in th ralm of history did not concrn him at all.
Chichagóv, on of th most zalous “cuttrs-off” and “brakrs-up,” who
had first wantd to ffct a divrsion in Grc and thn in Warsaw but
nvr wishd to go whr h was snt: Chichagóv, notd for th boldnss
with which h spok to th mpror, and who considrd Kutúzov to b
undr an obligation to him bcaus whn h was snt to mak pac
with Turky in 1811 indpndntly of Kutúzov, and found that pac had
alrady bn concludd, h admittd to th mpror that th mrit of
scuring that pac was rally Kutúzov’s; this Chichagóv was th first
to mt Kutúzov at th castl whr th lattr was to stay. In undrss
naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap undr his arm, h handd
Kutúzov a garrison rport and th kys of th town. Th contmptuously
rspctful attitud of th youngr mn to th old man in his dotag was
xprssd in th highst dgr by th bhavior of Chichagóv, who knw
of th accusations that wr bing dirctd against Kutúzov.
Whn spaking to Chichagóv, Kutúzov incidntally mntiond that th
vhicls packd with china that had bn capturd from him at Borísov
had bn rcovrd and would b rstord to him.
“You man to imply that I hav nothing to at out of.... On th
contrary, I can supply you with vrything vn if you want to giv
dinnr partis,” warmly rplid Chichagóv, who trid by vry word h
spok to prov his own rctitud and thrfor imagind Kutúzov to b
animatd by th sam dsir.
Kutúzov, shrugging his shouldrs, rplid with his subtl pntrating
smil: “I mant mrly to say what I said.”
Contrary to th mpror’s wish Kutúzov dtaind th gratr part of th
army at Vílna. Thos about him said that h bcam xtraordinarily slack
and physically fbl during his stay in that town. H attndd to army
affairs rluctantly, lft vrything to his gnrals, and whil awaiting
th mpror’s arrival ld a dissipatd lif.
Having lft Ptrsburg on th svnth of Dcmbr with his suit—Count
Tolstóy, Princ Volkónski, Arakchv, and othrs—th mpror rachd
Vílna on th lvnth, and in his travling sligh drov straight to
th castl. In spit of th svr frost som hundrd gnrals and staff
officrs in full parad uniform stood in front of th castl, as wll as
a guard of honor of th Smënov rgimnt.
A courir who gallopd to th castl in advanc, in a troyka with thr
foam-flckd horss, shoutd “Coming!” and Konovnítsyn rushd into th
vstibul to inform Kutúzov, who was waiting in th hall portr’s littl
lodg.
A minut latr th old man’s larg stout figur in full-drss uniform,
his chst covrd with ordrs and a scarf drawn round his stomach,
waddld out into th porch. H put on his hat with its paks to th
sids and, holding his glovs in his hand and walking with an ffort
sidways down th stps to th lvl of th strt, took in his hand th
rport h had prpard for th mpror.
Thr was running to and fro and whispring; anothr troyka flw
furiously up, and thn all ys wr turnd on an approaching sligh
in which th figurs of th mpror and Volkónski could alrady b
dscrid.
From th habit of fifty yars all this had a physically agitating ffct
on th old gnral. H carfully and hastily flt himslf all ovr,
radjustd his hat, and pulling himslf togthr drw himslf up and,
at th vry momnt whn th mpror, having alightd from th sligh,
liftd his ys to him, handd him th rport and bgan spaking in his
smooth, ingratiating voic.
Th mpror with a rapid glanc scannd Kutúzov from had to foot,
frownd for an instant, but immdiatly mastring himslf wnt up to th
old man, xtndd his arms and mbracd him. And this mbrac too, owing
to a long-standing imprssion rlatd to his innrmost flings, had its
usual ffct on Kutúzov and h gav a sob.
Th mpror grtd th officrs and th Smënov guard, and again
prssing th old man’s hand wnt with him into th castl.
Whn alon with th fild marshal th mpror xprssd his
dissatisfaction at th slownss of th pursuit and at th mistaks mad
at Krásno and th Brëzina, and informd him of his intntions for a
futur campaign abroad. Kutúzov mad no rjoindr or rmark. Th sam
submissiv, xprssionlss look with which h had listnd to th
mpror’s commands on th fild of Austrlitz svn yars bfor sttld
on his fac now.
Whn Kutúzov cam out of th study and with lowrd had was crossing
th ballroom with his havy waddling gait, h was arrstd by somon’s
voic saying:
“Your Srn Highnss!”
Kutúzov raisd his had and lookd for a long whil into th ys of
Count Tolstóy, who stood bfor him holding a silvr salvr on which lay
a small objct. Kutúzov smd not to undrstand what was xpctd of
him.
Suddnly h smd to rmmbr; a scarcly prcptibl smil flashd
across his puffy fac, and bowing low and rspctfully h took th
objct that lay on th salvr. It was th Ordr of St. Gorg of th
First Class.
CHAPTR XI
Nxt day th fild marshal gav a dinnr and ball which th mpror
honord by his prsnc. Kutúzov had rcivd th Ordr of St. Gorg
of th First Class and th mpror showd him th highst honors, but
vryon knw of th imprial dissatisfaction with him. Th propritis
wr obsrvd and th mpror was th first to st that xampl,
but vrybody undrstood that th old man was blamworthy and
good-for-nothing. Whn Kutúzov, conforming to a custom of Cathrin’s
day, ordrd th standards that had bn capturd to b lowrd at th
mpror’s ft on his ntring th ballroom, th mpror mad a wry fac
and muttrd somthing in which som popl caught th words, “th old
comdian.”
Th mpror’s displasur with Kutúzov was spcially incrasd at Vílna
by th fact that Kutúzov vidntly could not or would not undrstand th
importanc of th coming campaign.
Whn on th following morning th mpror said to th officrs assmbld
about him: “You hav not only savd Russia, you hav savd urop!” thy
all undrstood that th war was not ndd.
Kutúzov alon would not s this and opnly xprssd his opinion that
no frsh war could improv th position or add to th glory of Russia,
but could only spoil and lowr th glorious position that Russia had
gaind. H trid to prov to th mpror th impossibility of lvying
frsh troops, spok of th hardships alrady ndurd by th popl, of
th possibility of failur and so forth.
This bing th fild marshal’s fram of mind h was naturally rgardd
as mrly a hindranc and obstacl to th impnding war.
To avoid unplasant ncountrs with th old man, th natural mthod was
to do what had bn don with him at Austrlitz and with Barclay at
th bginning of th Russian campaign—to transfr th authority to th
mpror himslf, thus cutting th ground from undr th commandr in
chif’s ft without upstting th old man by informing him of th
chang.
With this objct his staff was gradually rconstructd and its ral
strngth rmovd and transfrrd to th mpror. Toll, Konovnítsyn, and
rmólov rcivd frsh appointmnts. vryon spok loudly of th fild
marshal’s grat waknss and failing halth.
His halth had to b bad for his plac to b takn away and givn to
anothr. And in fact his halth was poor.
So naturally, simply, and gradually—just as h had com from Turky to
th Trasury in Ptrsburg to rcruit th militia, and thn to th army
whn h was ndd thr—now whn his part was playd out, Kutúzov’s
plac was takn by a nw and ncssary prformr.
Th war of 1812, bsids its national significanc dar to vry Russian
hart, was now to assum anothr, a uropan, significanc.
Th movmnt of popls from wst to ast was to b succdd by a
movmnt of popls from ast to wst, and for this frsh war anothr
ladr was ncssary, having qualitis and viws diffring from
Kutúzov’s and animatd by diffrnt motivs.
Alxandr I was as ncssary for th movmnt of th popls from ast
to wst and for th rfixing of national frontirs as Kutúzov had bn
for th salvation and glory of Russia.
Kutúzov did not undrstand what urop, th balanc of powr, or
Napolon mant. H could not undrstand it. For th rprsntativ of
th Russian popl, aftr th nmy had bn dstroyd and Russia had
bn libratd and raisd to th summit of hr glory, thr was nothing
lft to do as a Russian. Nothing rmaind for th rprsntativ of th
national war but to di, and Kutúzov did.
CHAPTR XII
As gnrally happns, Pirr did not fl th full ffcts of th
physical privation and strain h had suffrd as prisonr until aftr
thy wr ovr. Aftr his libration h rachd Orël, and on th third
day thr, whn prparing to go to Kiv, h fll ill and was laid up
for thr months. H had what th doctors trmd “bilious fvr.” But
dspit th fact that th doctors tratd him, bld him, and gav him
mdicins to drink, h rcovrd.
Scarcly any imprssion was lft on Pirr’s mind by all that happnd
to him from th tim of his rscu till his illnss. H rmmbrd
only th dull gray wathr now rainy and now snowy, intrnal physical
distrss, and pains in his ft and sid. H rmmbrd a gnral
imprssion of th misfortuns and suffrings of popl and of bing
worrid by th curiosity of officrs and gnrals who qustiond him, h
also rmmbrd his difficulty in procuring a convyanc and horss, and
abov all h rmmbrd his incapacity to think and fl all that tim.
On th day of his rscu h had sn th body of Ptya Rostóv. That sam
day h had larnd that Princ Andrw, aftr surviving th battl of
Borodinó for mor than a month had rcntly did in th Rostóvs’ hous
at Yaroslávl, and Dnísov who told him this nws also mntiond Hlèn’s
dath, supposing that Pirr had hard of it long bfor. All this at
th tim smd mrly strang to Pirr: h flt h could not grasp its
significanc. Just thn h was only anxious to gt away as quickly as
possibl from placs whr popl wr killing on anothr, to som
pacful rfug whr h could rcovr himslf, rst, and think ovr
all th strang nw facts h had larnd; but on raching Orël h
immdiatly fll ill. Whn h cam to himslf aftr his illnss h saw
in attndanc on him two of his srvants, Trnty and Váska, who had
com from Moscow; and also his cousin th ldst princss, who had bn
living on his stat at lts and haring of his rscu and illnss had
com to look aftr him.
It was only gradually during his convalscnc that Pirr lost th
imprssions h had bcom accustomd to during th last fw months
and got usd to th ida that no on would oblig him to go anywhr
tomorrow, that no on would dpriv him of his warm bd, and that h
would b sur to gt his dinnr, ta, and suppr. But for a long tim in
his drams h still saw himslf in th conditions of captivity. In th
sam way littl by littl h cam to undrstand th nws h had bn
told aftr his rscu, about th dath of Princ Andrw, th dath of
his wif, and th dstruction of th Frnch.
A joyous fling of frdom—that complt inalinabl frdom natural
to man which h had first xprincd at th first halt outsid
Moscow—filld Pirr’s soul during his convalscnc. H was surprisd
to find that this innr frdom, which was indpndnt of xtrnal
conditions, now had as it wr an additional stting of xtrnal
librty. H was alon in a strang town, without acquaintancs. No on
dmandd anything of him or snt him anywhr. H had all h wantd:
th thought of his wif which had bn a continual tormnt to him was no
longr thr, sinc sh was no mor.
“Oh, how good! How splndid!” said h to himslf whn a clanly laid
tabl was movd up to him with savory bf ta, or whn h lay down for
th night on a soft clan bd, or whn h rmmbrd that th Frnch had
gon and that his wif was no mor. “Oh, how good, how splndid!”
And by old habit h askd himslf th qustion: “Wll, and what thn?
What am I going to do?” And h immdiatly gav himslf th answr:
“Wll, I shall liv. Ah, how splndid!”
Th vry qustion that had formrly tormntd him, th thing h had
continually sought to find—th aim of lif—no longr xistd for
him now. That sarch for th aim of lif had not mrly disappard
tmporarily—h flt that it no longr xistd for him and could not
prsnt itslf again. And this vry absnc of an aim gav him th
complt, joyous sns of frdom which constitutd his happinss at
this tim.
H could not s an aim, for h now had faith—not faith in any kind of
rul, or words, or idas, but faith in an vr-living, vr-manifst
God. Formrly h had sought Him in aims h st himslf. That sarch for
an aim had bn simply a sarch for God, and suddnly in his captivity
h had larnd not by words or rasoning but by dirct fling what his
nurs had told him long ago: that God is hr and vrywhr. In his
captivity h had larnd that in Karatáv God was gratr, mor infinit
and unfathomabl than in th Architct of th Univrs rcognizd by th
Frmasons. H flt lik a man who aftr straining his ys to s into
th far distanc finds what h sought at his vry ft. All his lif
h had lookd ovr th hads of th mn around him, whn h should hav
mrly lookd in front of him without straining his ys.
In th past h had nvr bn abl to find that grat inscrutabl
infinit somthing. H had only flt that it must xist somwhr and
had lookd for it. In vrything nar and comprhnsibl h had sn
only what was limitd, ptty, commonplac, and snslss. H had
quippd himslf with a mntal tlscop and lookd into rmot spac,
whr ptty worldlinss hiding itslf in misty distanc had smd to
him grat and infinit mrly bcaus it was not clarly sn. And such
had uropan lif, politics, Frmasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy
smd to him. But vn thn, at momnts of waknss as h had accountd
thm, his mind had pntratd to thos distancs and h had thr sn
th sam pttinss, worldlinss, and snslssnss. Now, howvr, h
had larnd to s th grat, trnal, and infinit in vrything, and
thrfor—to s it and njoy its contmplation—h naturally thrw away
th tlscop through which h had till now gazd ovr mn’s hads, and
gladly rgardd th vr-changing, trnally grat, unfathomabl, and
infinit lif around him. And th closr h lookd th mor tranquil and
happy h bcam. That dradful qustion, “What for?” which had formrly
dstroyd all his mntal difics, no longr xistd for him. To that
qustion, “What for?” a simpl answr was now always rady in his soul:
“Bcaus thr is a God, that God without whos will not on hair falls
from a man’s had.”
CHAPTR XIII
In xtrnal ways Pirr had hardly changd at all. In apparanc h
was just what h usd to b. As bfor h was absnt-mindd and smd
occupid not with what was bfor his ys but with somthing spcial
of his own. Th diffrnc btwn his formr and prsnt slf was that
formrly whn h did not grasp what lay bfor him or was said to
him, h had puckrd his forhad painfully as if vainly sking to
distinguish somthing at a distanc. At prsnt h still forgot what was
said to him and still did not s what was bfor his ys, but h now
lookd with a scarcly prcptibl and smingly ironic smil at what
was bfor him and listnd to what was said, though vidntly sing
and haring somthing quit diffrnt. Formrly h had appard to b
a kindhartd but unhappy man, and so popl had bn inclind to avoid
him. Now a smil at th joy of lif always playd round his lips, and
sympathy for othrs, shon in his ys with a qustioning look as to
whthr thy wr as contntd as h was, and popl flt plasd by his
prsnc.
Prviously h had talkd a grat dal, grw xcitd whn h talkd, and
sldom listnd; now h was sldom carrid away in convrsation and
knw how to listn so that popl radily told him thir most intimat
scrts.
Th princss, who had nvr likd Pirr and had bn particularly
hostil to him sinc sh had flt hrslf undr obligations to him aftr
th old count’s dath, now aftr staying a short tim in Orël—whr sh
had com intnding to show Pirr that in spit of his ingratitud sh
considrd it hr duty to nurs him—flt to hr surpris and vxation
that sh had bcom fond of him. Pirr did not in any way sk hr
approval, h mrly studid hr with intrst. Formrly sh had flt
that h rgardd hr with indiffrnc and irony, and so had shrunk into
hrslf as sh did with othrs and had shown him only th combativ sid
of hr natur; but now h smd to b trying to undrstand th most
intimat placs of hr hart, and, mistrustfully at first but aftrwards
gratfully, sh lt him s th hiddn, kindly sids of hr charactr.
Th most cunning man could not hav crpt into hr confidnc mor
succssfully, voking mmoris of th bst tims of hr youth and
showing sympathy with thm. Yt Pirr’s cunning consistd simply in
finding plasur in drawing out th human qualitis of th mbittrd,
hard, and (in hr own way) proud princss.
“Ys, h is a vry, vry kind man whn h is not undr th influnc of
bad popl but of popl such as myslf,” thought sh.
His srvants too—Trnty and Váska—in thir own way noticd th chang
that had takn plac in Pirr. Thy considrd that h had bcom much
“simplr.” Trnty, whn h had hlpd him undrss and wishd him good
night, oftn lingrd with his mastr’s boots in his hands and cloths
ovr his arm, to s whthr h would not start a talk. And Pirr,
noticing that Trnty wantd a chat, gnrally kpt him thr.
“Wll, tll m... now, how did you gt food?” h would ask.
And Trnty would bgin talking of th dstruction of Moscow, and of
th old count, and would stand for a long tim holding th cloths and
talking, or somtims listning to Pirr’s storis, and thn would go
out into th hall with a plasant sns of intimacy with his mastr and
affction for him.
Th doctor who attndd Pirr and visitd him vry day, though h
considrd it his duty as a doctor to pos as a man whos vry momnt
was of valu to suffring humanity, would sit for hours with Pirr
tlling him his favorit ancdots and his obsrvations on th
charactrs of his patints in gnral, and spcially of th ladis.
“It’s a plasur to talk to a man lik that; h is not lik our
provincials,” h would say.
Thr wr svral prisonrs from th Frnch army in Orël, and th
doctor brought on of thm, a young Italian, to s Pirr.
This officr bgan visiting Pirr, and th princss usd to mak fun of
th tndrnss th Italian xprssd for him.
Th Italian smd happy only whn h could com to s Pirr, talk
with him, tll him about his past, his lif at hom, and his lov,
and pour out to him his indignation against th Frnch and spcially
against Napolon.
“If all Russians ar in th last lik you, it is sacrilg to fight
such a nation,” h said to Pirr. “You, who hav suffrd so from th
Frnch, do not vn fl animosity toward thm.”
Pirr had vokd th passionat affction of th Italian mrly by
voking th bst sid of his natur and taking a plasur in so doing.
During th last days of Pirr’s stay in Orël his old Masonic
acquaintanc Count Willarski, who had introducd him to th lodg in
1807, cam to s him. Willarski was marrid to a Russian hirss who
had a larg stat in Orël provinc, and h occupid a tmporary post in
th commissariat dpartmnt in that town.
Haring that Bzúkhov was in Orël, Willarski, though thy had nvr bn
intimat, cam to him with th profssions of frindship and intimacy
that popl who mt in a dsrt gnrally xprss for on anothr.
Willarski flt dull in Orël and was plasd to mt a man of his own
circl and, as h supposd, of similar intrsts.
But to his surpris Willarski soon noticd that Pirr had laggd much
bhind th tims, and had sunk, as h xprssd it to himslf, into
apathy and gotism.
“You ar ltting yourslf go, my dar fllow,” h said.
But for all that Willarski found it plasantr now than it had bn
formrly to b with Pirr, and cam to s him vry day. To Pirr as
h lookd at and listnd to Willarski, it smd strang to think that
h had bn lik that himslf but a short tim bfor.
Willarski was a marrid man with a family, busy with his family affairs,
his wif’s affairs, and his official dutis. H rgardd all ths
occupations as hindrancs to lif, and considrd that thy wr all
contmptibl bcaus thir aim was th wlfar of himslf and his
family. Military, administrativ, political, and Masonic intrsts
continually absorbd his attntion. And Pirr, without trying to
chang th othr’s viws and without condmning him, but with th quit,
joyful, and amusd smil now habitual to him, was intrstd in this
strang though vry familiar phnomnon.
Thr was a nw fatur in Pirr’s rlations with Willarski, with th
princss, with th doctor, and with all th popl h now mt, which
gaind for him th gnral good will. This was his acknowldgmnt of
th impossibility of changing a man’s convictions by words, and his
rcognition of th possibility of vryon thinking, fling, and sing
things ach from his own point of viw. This lgitimat pculiarity of
ach individual which usd to xcit and irritat Pirr now bcam a
basis of th sympathy h flt for, and th intrst h took in, othr
popl. Th diffrnc, and somtims complt contradiction, btwn
mn’s opinions and thir livs, and btwn on man and anothr, plasd
him and drw from him an amusd and gntl smil.
In practical mattrs Pirr unxpctdly flt within himslf a cntr
of gravity h had prviously lackd. Formrly all pcuniary qustions,
spcially rqusts for mony to which, as an xtrmly walthy man,
h was vry xposd, producd in him a stat of hoplss agitation and
prplxity. “To giv or not to giv?” h had askd himslf. “I hav
it and h nds it. But somon ls nds it still mor. Who nds it
most? And prhaps thy ar both impostors?” In th old days h had bn
unabl to find a way out of all ths surmiss and had givn to all
who askd as long as h had anything to giv. Formrly h had bn in a
similar stat of prplxity with rgard to vry qustion concrning his
proprty, whn on prson advisd on thing and anothr somthing ls.
Now to his surpris h found that h no longr flt ithr doubt or
prplxity about ths qustions. Thr was now within him a judg who
by som rul unknown to him dcidd what should or should not b don.
H was as indiffrnt as hrtofor to mony mattrs, but now h flt
crtain of what ought and what ought not to b don. Th first tim h
had rcours to his nw judg was whn a Frnch prisonr, a colonl,
cam to him and, aftr talking a grat dal about his xploits,
concludd by making what amountd to a dmand that Pirr should giv
him four thousand francs to snd to his wif and childrn. Pirr
rfusd without th last difficulty or ffort, and was aftrwards
surprisd how simpl and asy had bn what usd to appar so
insurmountably difficult. At th sam tim that h rfusd th colonl’s
dmand h mad up his mind that h must hav rcours to artific whn
laving Orël, to induc th Italian officr to accpt som mony of
which h was vidntly in nd. A furthr proof to Pirr of his own
mor sttld outlook on practical mattrs was furnishd by his dcision
with rgard to his wif’s dbts and to th rbuilding of his houss in
and nar Moscow.
His had stward cam to him at Orël and Pirr rckond up with him his
diminishd incom. Th burning of Moscow had cost him, according to th
had stward’s calculation, about two million rubls.
To consol Pirr for ths losss th had stward gav him an stimat
showing that dspit ths losss his incom would not b diminishd but
would vn b incrasd if h rfusd to pay his wif’s dbts which h
was undr no obligation to mt, and did not rbuild his Moscow hous
and th country hous on his Moscow stat, which had cost him ighty
thousand rubls a yar and brought in nothing.
“Ys, of cours that’s tru,” said Pirr with a chrful smil. “I
don’t nd all that at all. By bing ruind I hav bcom much richr.”
But in January Savlich cam from Moscow and gav him an account of th
stat of things thr, and spok of th stimat an architct had mad
of th cost of rbuilding th town and country houss, spaking of this
as of a sttld mattr. About th sam tim h rcivd lttrs from
Princ Vasíli and othr Ptrsburg acquaintancs spaking of his wif’s
dbts. And Pirr dcidd that th stward’s proposals which had so
plasd him wr wrong and that h must go to Ptrsburg and sttl his
wif’s affairs and must rbuild in Moscow. Why this was ncssary h
did not know, but h knw for crtain that it was ncssary. His incom
would b rducd by thr fourths, but h flt it must b don.
Willarski was going to Moscow and thy agrd to travl togthr.
During th whol tim of his convalscnc in Orël Pirr had
xprincd a fling of joy, frdom, and lif; but whn during his
journy h found himslf in th opn world and saw hundrds of nw
facs, that fling was intnsifid. Throughout his journy h flt lik
a schoolboy on holiday. vryon—th stagcoach drivr, th post-hous
ovrsrs, th pasants on th roads and in th villags—had a nw
significanc for him. Th prsnc and rmarks of Willarski who
continually dplord th ignoranc and povrty of Russia and its
backwardnss compard with urop only hightnd Pirr’s plasur.
Whr Willarski saw dadnss Pirr saw an xtraordinary strngth and
vitality—th strngth which in that vast spac amid th snows maintaind
th lif of this original, pculiar, and uniqu popl. H did not
contradict Willarski and vn smd to agr with him—an apparnt
agrmnt bing th simplst way to avoid discussions that could lad to
nothing—and h smild joyfully as h listnd to him.
CHAPTR XIV
It would b difficult to xplain why and whithr ants whos hap
has bn dstroyd ar hurrying: som from th hap dragging bits of
rubbish, larva, and corpss, othrs back to th hap, or why thy
jostl, ovrtak on anothr, and fight, and it would b qually
difficult to xplain what causd th Russians aftr th dpartur of th
Frnch to throng to th plac that had formrly bn Moscow. But whn
w watch th ants round thir ruind hap, th tnacity, nrgy, and
immns numbr of th dlving inscts prov that dspit th dstruction
of th hap, somthing indstructibl, which though intangibl is th
ral strngth of th colony, still xists; and similarly, though in
Moscow in th month of Octobr thr was no govrnmnt and no churchs,
shrins, richs, or houss—it was still th Moscow it had bn in
August. All was dstroyd, xcpt somthing intangibl yt powrful and
indstructibl.
Th motivs of thos who throngd from all sids to Moscow aftr it had
bn clard of th nmy wr most divrs and prsonal, and at first
for th most part savag and brutal. On motiv only thy all had in
common: a dsir to gt to th plac that had bn calld Moscow, to
apply thir activitis thr.
Within a wk Moscow alrady had fiftn thousand inhabitants, in a
fortnight twnty-fiv thousand, and so on. By th autumn of 1813 th
numbr, vr incrasing and incrasing, xcdd what it had bn in
1812.
Th first Russians to ntr Moscow wr th Cossacks of Wintzingrod’s
dtachmnt, pasants from th adjacnt villags, and rsidnts who had
fld from Moscow and had bn hiding in its vicinity. Th Russians who
ntrd Moscow, finding it plundrd, plundrd it in thir turn. Thy
continud what th Frnch had bgun. Trains of pasant carts cam to
Moscow to carry off to th villags what had bn abandond in th
ruind houss and th strts. Th Cossacks carrid off what thy could
to thir camps, and th housholdrs sizd all thy could find in othr
houss and movd it to thir own, prtnding that it was thir proprty.
But th first plundrrs wr followd by a scond and a third
contingnt, and with incrasing numbrs plundring bcam mor and mor
difficult and assumd mor dfinit forms.
Th Frnch found Moscow abandond but with all th organizations of
rgular lif, with divrs branchs of commrc and craftsmanship, with
luxury, and govrnmntal and rligious institutions. Ths forms wr
liflss but still xistd. Thr wr bazaars, shops, warhouss,
markt stalls, granaris—for th most part still stockd with goods—and
thr wr factoris and workshops, palacs and walthy houss filld
with luxuris, hospitals, prisons, govrnmnt offics, churchs, and
cathdrals. Th longr th Frnch rmaind th mor ths forms of town
lif prishd, until finally all was mrgd into on confusd, liflss
scn of plundr.
Th mor th plundring by th Frnch continud, th mor both th
walth of Moscow and th strngth of its plundrrs was dstroyd. But
plundring by th Russians, with which th roccupation of th city

CHAPTR XV
At th nd of January Pirr wnt to Moscow and stayd in an annx of
his hous which had not bn burnd. H calld on Count Rostopchín and
on som acquaintancs who wr back in Moscow, and h intndd to lav
for Ptrsburg two days latr. vrybody was clbrating th victory,
vrything was bubbling with lif in th ruind but rviving city.
vryon was plasd to s Pirr, vryon wishd to mt him, and
vryon qustiond him about what h had sn. Pirr flt particularly
wll disposd toward thm all, but was now instinctivly on his
guard for far of binding himslf in any way. To all qustions put to
him—whthr important or quit trifling—such as: Whr would h liv?
Was h going to rbuild? Whn was h going to Ptrsburg and would h
mind taking a parcl for somon?—h rplid: “Ys, prhaps,” or, “I
think so,” and so on.
H had hard that th Rostóvs wr at Kostromá but th thought of
Natásha sldom occurrd to him. If it did it was only as a plasant
mmory of th distant past. H flt himslf not only fr from social
obligations but also from that fling which, it smd to him, h had
arousd in himslf.
On th third day aftr his arrival h hard from th Drubtskóys that
Princss Mary was in Moscow. Th dath, suffrings, and last days of
Princ Andrw had oftn occupid Pirr’s thoughts and now rcurrd to
him with frsh vividnss. Having hard at dinnr that Princss Mary
was in Moscow and living in hr hous—which had not bn burnd—in
Vozdvízhnka Strt, h drov that sam vning to s hr.
On his way to th hous Pirr kpt thinking of Princ Andrw, of thir
frindship, of his various mtings with him, and spcially of th last
on at Borodinó.
“Is it possibl that h did in th bittr fram of mind h was thn in?
Is it possibl that th maning of lif was not disclosd to him
bfor h did?” thought Pirr. H rcalld Karatáv and his dath and
involuntarily bgan to compar ths two mn, so diffrnt, and yt so
similar in that thy had both livd and both did and in th lov h
flt for both of thm.
Pirr drov up to th hous of th old princ in a most srious mood.
Th hous had scapd th fir; it showd signs of damag but its
gnral aspct was unchangd. Th old footman, who mt Pirr with a
strn fac as if wishing to mak th visitor fl that th absnc
of th old princ had not disturbd th ordr of things in th hous,
informd him that th princss had gon to hr own apartmnts, and that
sh rcivd on Sundays.
“Announc m. Prhaps sh will s m,” said Pirr.
“Ys, sir,” said th man. “Plas stp into th portrait gallry.”
A fw minuts latr th footman rturnd with Dssalls, who brought
word from th princss that sh would b vry glad to s Pirr if h
would xcus hr want of crmony and com upstairs to hr apartmnt.
In a rathr low room lit by on candl sat th princss and with hr
anothr prson drssd in black. Pirr rmmbrd that th princss
always had lady companions, but who thy wr and what thy wr lik
h nvr knw or rmmbrd. “This must b on of hr companions,” h
thought, glancing at th lady in th black drss.
Th princss ros quickly to mt him and hld out hr hand.
“Ys,” sh said, looking at his altrd fac aftr h had kissd hr
hand, “so this is how w mt again. H spok of you vn at th vry
last,” sh wnt on, turning hr ys from Pirr to hr companion with a
shynss that surprisd him for an instant.
“I was so glad to har of your safty. It was th first pic of good
nws w had rcivd for a long tim.”
Again th princss glancd round at hr companion with vn mor
unasinss in hr mannr and was about to add somthing, but Pirr
intrruptd hr.
“Just imagin—I knw nothing about him!” said h. “I thought h had bn
killd. All I know I hard at scond hand from othrs. I only know that
h fll in with th Rostóvs.... What a strang coincidnc!”
Pirr spok rapidly and with animation. H glancd onc at th
companion’s fac, saw hr attntiv and kindly gaz fixd on him, and,
as oftn happns whn on is talking, flt somhow that this companion
in th black drss was a good, kind, xcllnt cratur who would not
hindr his convrsing frly with Princss Mary.
But whn h mntiond th Rostóvs, Princss Mary’s fac xprssd still
gratr mbarrassmnt. Sh again glancd rapidly from Pirr’s fac to
that of th lady in th black drss and said:
“Do you rally not rcogniz hr?”
Pirr lookd again at th companion’s pal, dlicat fac with its
black ys and pculiar mouth, and somthing nar to him, long forgottn
and mor than swt, lookd at him from thos attntiv ys.
“But no, it can’t b!” h thought. “This strn, thin, pal fac that
looks so much oldr! It cannot b sh. It mrly rminds m of hr.”
But at that momnt Princss Mary said, “Natásha!” And with difficulty,
ffort, and strss, lik th opning of a door grown rusty on its
hings, a smil appard on th fac with th attntiv ys, and from
that opning door cam a brath of fragranc which suffusd Pirr with
a happinss h had long forgottn and of which h had not vn bn
thinking—spcially at that momnt. It suffusd him, sizd him, and
nvlopd him compltly. Whn sh smild doubt was no longr possibl,
it was Natásha and h lovd hr.
At that momnt Pirr involuntarily btrayd to hr, to Princss Mary,
and abov all to himslf, a scrt of which h himslf had bn unawar.
H flushd joyfully yt with painful distrss. H trid to hid his
agitation. But th mor h trid to hid it th mor clarly—clarr
than any words could hav don—did h btray to himslf, to hr, and to
Princss Mary that h lovd hr.
“No, it’s only th unxpctdnss of it,” thought Pirr. But as soon as
h trid to continu th convrsation h had bgun with Princss Mary h
again glancd at Natásha, and a still-dpr flush suffusd his fac and
a still-strongr agitation of mingld joy and far sizd his soul. H
bcam confusd in his spch and stoppd in th middl of what h was
saying.
Pirr had faild to notic Natásha bcaus h did not at all xpct to
s hr thr, but h had faild to rcogniz hr bcaus th chang in
hr sinc h last saw hr was immns. Sh had grown thin and pal, but
that was not what mad hr unrcognizabl; sh was unrcognizabl at th
momnt h ntrd bcaus on that fac whos ys had always shon with
a supprssd smil of th joy of lif, now whn h first ntrd and
glancd at hr thr was not th last shadow of a smil: only hr ys
wr kindly attntiv and sadly intrrogativ.
Pirr’s confusion was not rflctd by any confusion on Natásha’s part,
but only by th plasur that just prcptibly lit up hr whol fac.
CHAPTR XVI
“Sh has com to stay with m,” said Princss Mary. “Th count and
countss will b hr in a fw days. Th countss is in a dradful
stat; but it was ncssary for Natásha hrslf to s a doctor. Thy
insistd on hr coming with m.”
“Ys, is thr a family fr from sorrow now?” said Pirr, addrssing
Natásha. “You know it happnd th vry day w wr rscud. I saw him.
What a dlightful boy h was!”
Natásha lookd at him, and by way of answr to his words hr ys
widnd and lit up.
“What can on say or think of as a consolation?” said Pirr. “Nothing!
Why had such a splndid boy, so full of lif, to di?”
“Ys, in ths days it would b hard to liv without faith...” rmarkd
Princss Mary.
“Ys, ys, that is rally tru,” Pirr hastily intrruptd hr.
“Why is it tru?” Natásha askd, looking attntivly into Pirr’s ys.
“How can you ask why?” said Princss Mary. “Th thought alon of what
awaits...”
Natásha without waiting for Princss Mary to finish again lookd
inquiringly at Pirr.
“And bcaus,” Pirr continud, “only on who blivs that thr is a
God ruling us can bar a loss such as hrs and... yours.”
Natásha had alrady opnd hr mouth to spak but suddnly stoppd.
Pirr hurridly turnd away from hr and again addrssd Princss Mary,
asking about his frind’s last days.
Pirr’s confusion had now almost vanishd, but at th sam tim h flt
that his frdom had also compltly gon. H flt that thr was now a
judg of his vry word and action whos judgmnt mattrd mor to
him than that of all th rst of th world. As h spok now h was
considring what imprssion his words would mak on Natásha. H did
not purposly say things to plas hr, but whatvr h was saying h
rgardd from hr standpoint.
Princss Mary—rluctantly as is usual in such cass—bgan tlling of
th condition in which sh had found Princ Andrw. But Pirr’s fac
quivring with motion, his qustions and his agr rstlss xprssion,
gradually complld hr to go into dtails which sh fard to rcall
for hr own sak.
“Ys, ys, and so...?” Pirr kpt saying as h land toward hr with
his whol body and agrly listnd to hr story. “Ys, ys... so h
grw tranquil and softnd? With all his soul h had always sought
on thing—to b prfctly good—so h could not b afraid of dath. Th
faults h had—if h had any—wr not of his making. So h did softn?...
What a happy thing that h saw you again,” h addd, suddnly turning to
Natásha and looking at hr with ys full of tars.
Natásha’s fac twitchd. Sh frownd and lowrd hr ys for a momnt.
Sh hsitatd for an instant whthr to spak or not.
“Ys, that was happinss,” sh thn said in hr quit voic with its
dp chst nots. “For m it crtainly was happinss.” Sh pausd. “And
h... h... h said h was wishing for it at th vry momnt I ntrd
th room....”
Natásha’s voic brok. Sh blushd, prssd hr claspd hands on hr
kns, and thn controlling hrslf with an vidnt ffort liftd hr
had and bgan to spak rapidly.
“W knw nothing of it whn w startd from Moscow. I did not dar to
ask about him. Thn suddnly Sónya told m h was travling with us. I
had no ida and could not imagin what stat h was in, all I wantd was
to s him and b with him,” sh said, trmbling, and brathing quickly.
And not ltting thm intrrupt hr sh wnt on to tll what sh had
nvr yt mntiond to anyon—all sh had livd through during thos
thr wks of thir journy and lif at Yaroslávl.
Pirr listnd to hr with lips partd and ys fixd upon hr full of
tars. As h listnd h did not think of Princ Andrw, nor of dath,
nor of what sh was tlling. H listnd to hr and flt only pity for
hr, for what sh was suffring now whil sh was spaking.
Princss Mary, frowning in hr ffort to hold back hr tars, sat bsid
Natásha, and hard for th first tim th story of thos last days of
hr brothr’s and Natásha’s lov.
vidntly Natásha ndd to tll that painful yt joyful tal.
Sh spok, mingling most trifling dtails with th intimat scrts of
hr soul, and it smd as if sh could nvr finish. Svral tims sh
rpatd th sam thing twic.
Dssalls’ voic was hard outsid th door asking whthr littl
Nicholas might com in to say good night.
“Wll, that’s all—vrything,” said Natásha.
Sh got up quickly just as Nicholas ntrd, almost ran to th door
which was hiddn by curtains, struck hr had against it, and rushd
from th room with a moan ithr of pain or sorrow.
Pirr gazd at th door through which sh had disappard and did not
undrstand why h suddnly flt all alon in th world.
Princss Mary rousd him from his abstraction by drawing his attntion
to hr nphw who had ntrd th room.
At that momnt of motional tndrnss young Nicholas’ fac, which
rsmbld his fathr’s, affctd Pirr so much that whn h had kissd
th boy h got up quickly, took out his handkrchif, and wnt to th
window. H wishd to tak lav of Princss Mary, but sh would not lt
him go.
“No, Natásha and I somtims don’t go to slp till aftr two, so plas
don’t go. I will ordr suppr. Go downstairs, w will com immdiatly.”
Bfor Pirr lft th room Princss Mary told him: “This is th first
tim sh has talkd of him lik that.”
CHAPTR XVII
Pirr was shown into th larg, brightly lit dining room; a fw minuts
latr h hard footstps and Princss Mary ntrd with Natásha. Natásha
was calm, though a svr and grav xprssion had again sttld on hr
fac. Thy all thr of thm now xprincd that fling of awkwardnss
which usually follows aftr a srious and hartflt talk. It is
impossibl to go back to th sam convrsation, to talk of trifls is
awkward, and yt th dsir to spak is thr and silnc sms lik
affctation. Thy wnt silntly to tabl. Th footmn drw back th
chairs and pushd thm up again. Pirr unfoldd his cold tabl napkin
and, rsolving to brak th silnc, lookd at Natásha and at Princss
Mary. Thy had vidntly both formd th sam rsolution; th ys of
both shon with satisfaction and a confssion that bsids sorrow lif
also has joy.
“Do you tak vodka, Count?” askd Princss Mary, and thos words
suddnly banishd th shadows of th past. “Now tll us about yourslf,”
said sh. “On hars such improbabl wondrs about you.”
“Ys,” rplid Pirr with th smil of mild irony now habitual to him.
“Thy vn tll m wondrs I myslf nvr dramd of! Mary Abrámovna
invitd m to hr hous and kpt tlling m what had happnd, or ought
to hav happnd, to m. Stpán Stpánych also instructd m how I ought
to tll of my xprincs. In gnral I hav noticd that it is vry
asy to b an intrsting man (I am an intrsting man now); popl
invit m out and tll m all about myslf.”
Natásha smild and was on th point of spaking.
“W hav bn told,” Princss Mary intrruptd hr, “that you lost two
millions in Moscow. Is that tru?”
“But I am thr tims as rich as bfor,” rturnd Pirr.
Though th position was now altrd by his dcision to pay his wif’s
dbts and to rbuild his houss, Pirr still maintaind that h had
bcom thr tims as rich as bfor.
“What I hav crtainly gaind is frdom,” h bgan sriously, but did
not continu, noticing that this thm was too gotistic.
“And ar you building?”
“Ys. Savlich says I must!”
“Tll m, you did not know of th countss’ dath whn you dcidd to
rmain in Moscow?” askd Princss Mary and immdiatly blushd, noticing
that hr qustion, following his mntion of frdom, ascribd to his
words a maning h had prhaps not intndd.
“No,” answrd Pirr, vidntly not considring awkward th maning
Princss Mary had givn to his words. “I hard of it in Orël and you
cannot imagin how it shockd m. W wr not an xmplary coupl,” h
addd quickly, glancing at Natásha and noticing on hr fac curiosity as
to how h would spak of his wif, “but hr dath shockd m trribly.
Whn two popl quarrl thy ar always both in fault, and on’s own
guilt suddnly bcoms trribly srious whn th othr is no longr
aliv. And thn such a dath... without frinds and without consolation!
I am vry, vry sorry for hr,” h concludd, and was plasd to notic
a look of glad approval on Natásha’s fac.
“Ys, and so you ar onc mor an ligibl bachlor,” said Princss
Mary.
Pirr suddnly flushd crimson and for a long tim trid not to look
at Natásha. Whn h vnturd to glanc hr way again hr fac was cold,
strn, and h fancid vn contmptuous.
“And did you rally s and spak to Napolon, as w hav bn told?”
said Princss Mary.
Pirr laughd.
“No, not onc! vrybody sms to imagin that bing takn prisonr
mans bing Napolon’s gust. Not only did I nvr s him but I hard
nothing about him—I was in much lowr company!”
Suppr was ovr, and Pirr who at first dclind to spak about his
captivity was gradually ld on to do so.
“But it’s tru that you rmaind in Moscow to kill Napolon?” Natásha
askd with a slight smil. “I gussd it thn whn w mt at th
Súkharv towr, do you rmmbr?”
Pirr admittd that it was tru, and from that was gradually ld by
Princss Mary’s qustions and spcially by Natásha’s into giving a
dtaild account of his advnturs.
At first h spok with th amusd and mild irony now customary with
him toward vrybody and spcially toward himslf, but whn h cam
to dscrib th horrors and suffrings h had witnssd h was
unconsciously carrid away and bgan spaking with th supprssd
motion of a man r-xprincing in rcollction strong imprssions h
has livd through.
Princss Mary with a gntl smil lookd now at Pirr and now at
Natásha. In th whol narrativ sh saw only Pirr and his goodnss.
Natásha, laning on hr lbow, th xprssion of hr fac constantly
changing with th narrativ, watchd Pirr with an attntion that nvr
wandrd—vidntly hrslf xprincing all that h dscribd. Not only
hr look, but hr xclamations and th brif qustions sh put, showd
Pirr that sh undrstood just what h wishd to convy. It was clar
that sh undrstood not only what h said but also what h wishd to,
but could not, xprss in words. Th account Pirr gav of th incidnt
with th child and th woman for protcting whom h was arrstd was
this: “It was an awful sight—childrn abandond, som in th flams...
On was snatchd out bfor my ys... and thr wr womn who had
thir things snatchd off and thir arrings torn out...” h flushd and
grw confusd. “Thn a patrol arrivd and all th mn—all thos who wr
not looting, that is—wr arrstd, and I among thm.”
“I am sur you’r not tlling us vrything; I am sur you did
somthing...” said Natásha and pausing addd, “somthing fin?”
Pirr continud. Whn h spok of th xcution h wantd to pass
ovr th horribl dtails, but Natásha insistd that h should not omit
anything.
Pirr bgan to tll about Karatáv, but pausd. By this tim h had
risn from th tabl and was pacing th room, Natásha following him with
hr ys. Thn h addd:
“No, you can’t undrstand what I larnd from that illitrat man—that
simpl fllow.”
“Ys, ys, go on!” said Natásha. “Whr is h?”
“Thy killd him almost bfor my ys.”
And Pirr, his voic trmbling continually, wnt on to tll of th last
days of thir rtrat, of Karatáv’s illnss and his dath.
H told of his advnturs as h had nvr yt rcalld thm. H now, as
it wr, saw a nw maning in all h had gon through. Now that h was
tlling it all to Natásha h xprincd that plasur which a man has
whn womn listn to him—not clvr womn who whn listning ithr try
to rmmbr what thy har to nrich thir minds and whn opportunity
offrs to rtll it, or who wish to adopt it to som thought of thir
own and promptly contribut thir own clvr commnts prpard in thir
littl mntal workshop—but th plasur givn by ral womn giftd with
a capacity to slct and absorb th vry bst a man shows of himslf.
Natásha without knowing it was all attntion: sh did not los a word,
no singl quivr in Pirr’s voic, no look, no twitch of a muscl in
his fac, nor a singl gstur. Sh caught th unfinishd word in its
flight and took it straight into hr opn hart, divining th scrt
maning of all Pirr’s mntal travail.
Princss Mary undrstood his story and sympathizd with him, but sh
now saw somthing ls that absorbd all hr attntion. Sh saw th
possibility of lov and happinss btwn Natásha and Pirr, and th
first thought of this filld hr hart with gladnss.
It was thr o’clock in th morning. Th footmn cam in with sad and
strn facs to chang th candls, but no on noticd thm.
Pirr finishd his story. Natásha continud to look at him intntly
with bright, attntiv, and animatd ys, as if trying to undrstand
somthing mor which h had prhaps lft untold. Pirr in shamfacd
and happy confusion glancd occasionally at hr, and trid to think what
to say nxt to introduc a frsh subjct. Princss Mary was silnt. It
occurrd to non of thm that it was thr o’clock and tim to go to
bd.
“Popl spak of misfortuns and suffrings,” rmarkd Pirr, “but if
at this momnt I wr askd: ‘Would you rathr b what you wr bfor
you wr takn prisonr, or go through all this again?’ thn for
havn’s sak lt m again hav captivity and horsflsh! W imagin
that whn w ar thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is
only thn that what is nw and good bgins. Whil thr is lif thr is
happinss. Thr is much, much bfor us. I say this to you,” h addd,
turning to Natásha.
“Ys, ys,” sh said, answring somthing quit diffrnt. “I too should
wish nothing but to rliv it all from th bginning.”
Pirr lookd intntly at hr.
“Ys, and nothing mor,” said Natásha.
“It’s not tru, not tru!” crid Pirr. “I am not to blam for bing
aliv and wishing to liv—nor you ithr.”
Suddnly Natásha bnt hr had, covrd hr fac with hr hands, and
bgan to cry.
“What is it, Natásha?” said Princss Mary.
“Nothing, nothing.” Sh smild at Pirr through hr tars. “Good night!
It is tim for bd.”
Pirr ros and took his lav.
Princss Mary and Natásha mt as usual in th bdroom. Thy talkd of
what Pirr had told thm. Princss Mary did not xprss hr opinion of
Pirr nor did Natásha spak of him.
“Wll, good night, Mary!” said Natásha. “Do you know, I am oftn afraid
that by not spaking of him” (sh mant Princ Andrw) “for far of not
doing justic to our flings, w forgt him.”
Princss Mary sighd dply and thrby acknowldgd th justic of
Natásha’s rmark, but sh did not xprss agrmnt in words.
“Is it possibl to forgt?” said sh.
“It did m so much good to tll all about it today. It was hard and
painful, but good, vry good!” said Natásha. “I am sur h rally lovd
him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?” sh addd, suddnly
blushing.
“To tll Pirr? Oh, ys. What a splndid man h is!” said Princss
Mary.
“Do you know, Mary...” Natásha suddnly said with a mischivous smil
such as Princss Mary had not sn on hr fac for a long tim, “h has
somhow grown so clan, smooth, and frsh—as if h had just com out of
a Russian bath; do you undrstand? Out of a moral bath. Isn’t it tru?”
“Ys,” rplid Princss Mary. “H has gratly improvd.”
“With a short coat and his hair croppd; just as if, wll, just as if h
had com straight from th bath... Papa usd to...”
“I undrstand why h” (Princ Andrw) “likd no on so much as him,”
said Princss Mary.
“Ys, and yt h is quit diffrnt. Thy say mn ar frinds whn thy
ar quit diffrnt. That must b tru. Rally h is quit unlik him—in
vrything.”
“Ys, but h’s wondrful.”
“Wll, good night,” said Natásha.
And th sam mischivous smil lingrd for a long tim on hr fac as
if it had bn forgottn thr.
CHAPTR XVIII
It was a long tim bfor Pirr could fall aslp that night. H pacd
up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problm
and frowning, now suddnly shrugging his shouldrs and wincing, and now
smiling happily.
H was thinking of Princ Andrw, of Natásha, and of thir lov, at on
momnt jalous of hr past, thn rproaching himslf for that fling.
It was alrady six in th morning and h still pacd up and down th
room.
“Wll, what’s to b don if it cannot b avoidd? What’s to b don?
vidntly it has to b so,” said h to himslf, and hastily undrssing
h got into bd, happy and agitatd but fr from hsitation or
indcision.
“Strang and impossibl as such happinss sms, I must do vrything
that sh and I may b man and wif,” h told himslf.
A fw days prviously Pirr had dcidd to go to Ptrsburg on th
Friday. Whn h awok on th Thursday, Savlich cam to ask him about
packing for th journy.
“What, to Ptrsburg? What is Ptrsburg? Who is thr in Ptrsburg?”
h askd involuntarily, though only to himslf. “Oh, ys, long ago
bfor this happnd I did for som rason man to go to Ptrsburg,”
h rflctd. “Why? But prhaps I shall go. What a good fllow h is and
how attntiv, and how h rmmbrs vrything,” h thought, looking at
Savlich’s old fac, “and what a plasant smil h has!”
“Wll, Savlich, do you still not wish to accpt your frdom?” Pirr
askd him.
“What’s th good of frdom to m, your xcllncy? W livd undr th
lat count—th kingdom of havn b his!—and w hav livd undr you
too, without vr bing wrongd.”
“And your childrn?”
“Th childrn will liv just th sam. With such mastrs on can liv.”
“But what about my hirs?” said Pirr. “Supposing I suddnly marry...
it might happn,” h addd with an involuntary smil.
“If I may tak th librty, your xcllncy, it would b a good thing.”
“How asy h thinks it,” thought Pirr. “H dosn’t know how trribl
it is and how dangrous. Too soon or too lat... it is trribl!”
“So what ar your ordrs? Ar you starting tomorrow?” askd Savlich.
“No, I’ll put it off for a bit. I’ll tll you latr. You must forgiv
th troubl I hav put you to,” said Pirr, and sing Savlich smil,
h thought: “But how strang it is that h should not know that now
thr is no Ptrsburg for m, and that that must b sttld first of
all! But probably h knows it wll nough and is only prtnding. Shall
I hav a talk with him and s what h thinks?” Pirr rflctd. “No,
anothr tim.”
At brakfast Pirr told th princss, his cousin, that h had bn to
s Princss Mary th day bfor and had thr mt—“Whom do you think?
Natásha Rostóva!”
Th princss smd to s nothing mor xtraordinary in that than if h
had sn Anna Smënovna.
“Do you know hr?” askd Pirr.
“I hav sn th princss,” sh rplid. “I hard that thy wr
arranging a match for hr with young Rostóv. It would b a vry good
thing for th Rostóvs, thy ar said to b uttrly ruind.”
“No; I man do you know Natásha Rostóva?”
“I hard about that affair of hrs at th tim. It was a grat pity.”
“No, sh ithr dosn’t undrstand or is prtnding,” thought Pirr.
“Bttr not say anything to hr ithr.”
Th princss too had prpard provisions for Pirr’s journy.
“How kind thy all ar,” thought Pirr. “What is surprising is that
thy should troubl about ths things now whn it can no longr b of
intrst to thm. And all for m!”
On th sam day th Chif of Polic cam to Pirr, inviting him to snd
a rprsntativ to th Factd Palac to rcovr things that wr to b
rturnd to thir ownrs that day.
“And this man too,” thought Pirr, looking into th fac of th Chif
of Polic. “What a fin, good-looking officr and how kind. Fancy
bothring about such trifls now! And thy actually say h is not honst
and taks bribs. What nonsns! Bsids, why shouldn’t h tak bribs?
That’s th way h was brought up, and vrybody dos it. But what a
kind, plasant fac and how h smils as h looks at m.”
Pirr wnt to Princss Mary’s to dinnr.
As h drov through th strts past th houss that had bn burnd
down, h was surprisd by th bauty of thos ruins. Th pictursqunss
of th chimny stacks and tumbl-down walls of th burnd-out quartrs
of th town, strtching out and concaling on anothr, rmindd him of
th Rhin and th Colossum. Th cabmn h mt and thir passngrs,
th carpntrs cutting th timbr for nw houss with axs, th womn
hawkrs, and th shopkprs, all lookd at him with chrful baming
ys that smd to say: “Ah, thr h is! Lt’s s what will com of
it!”
At th ntranc to Princss Mary’s hous Pirr flt doubtful whthr
h had rally bn thr th night bfor and rally sn Natásha and
talkd to hr. “Prhaps I imagind it; prhaps I shall go in and find
no on thr.” But h had hardly ntrd th room bfor h flt hr
prsnc with his whol bing by th loss of his sns of frdom. Sh
was in th sam black drss with soft folds and hr hair was don th
sam way as th day bfor, yt sh was quit diffrnt. Had sh bn
lik this whn h ntrd th day bfor h could not for a momnt hav
faild to rcogniz hr.
Sh was as h had known hr almost as a child and latr on as Princ
Andrw’s fianc. A bright qustioning light shon in hr ys, and on
hr fac was a frindly and strangly roguish xprssion.
Pirr dind with thm and would hav spnt th whol vning thr, but
Princss Mary was going to vsprs and Pirr lft th hous with hr.
Nxt day h cam arly, dind, and stayd th whol vning. Though
Princss Mary and Natásha wr vidntly glad to s thir visitor and
though all Pirr’s intrst was now cntrd in that hous, by th
vning thy had talkd ovr vrything and th convrsation passd from
on trivial topic to anothr and rpatdly brok off. H stayd so long
that Princss Mary and Natásha xchangd glancs, vidntly wondring
whn h would go. Pirr noticd this but could not go. H flt unasy
and mbarrassd, but sat on bcaus h simply could not gt up and tak
his lav.
Princss Mary, forsing no nd to this, ros first, and complaining of
a hadach bgan to say good night.
“So you ar going to Ptrsburg tomorrow?” sh askd.
“No, I am not going,” Pirr rplid hastily, in a surprisd ton and as
though offndd. “Ys... no... to Ptrsburg? Tomorrow—but I won’t say
good-by yt. I will call round in cas you hav any commissions for m,”
said h, standing bfor Princss Mary and turning rd, but not taking
his dpartur.
Natásha gav him hr hand and wnt out. Princss Mary on th othr hand
instad of going away sank into an armchair, and lookd strnly and
intntly at him with hr dp, radiant ys. Th warinss sh
had plainly shown bfor had now quit passd off. With a dp and
long-drawn sigh sh smd to b prpard for a lngthy talk.
Whn Natásha lft th room Pirr’s confusion and awkwardnss
immdiatly vanishd and wr rplacd by agr xcitmnt. H quickly
movd an armchair toward Princss Mary.
“Ys, I wantd to tll you,” said h, answring hr look as if sh had
spokn. “Princss, hlp m! What am I to do? Can I hop? Princss, my
dar frind, listn! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of hr, I
know it’s impossibl to spak of it now. But I want to b a brothr to
hr. No, not that, I don’t, I can’t...”
H pausd and rubbd his fac and ys with his hands.
“Wll,” h wnt on with an vidnt ffort at slf-control and cohrnc.
“I don’t know whn I bgan to lov hr, but I hav lovd hr and hr
alon all my lif, and I lov hr so that I cannot imagin lif without
hr. I cannot propos to hr at prsnt, but th thought that
prhaps sh might somday b my wif and that I may b missing that
possibility... that possibility... is trribl. Tll m, can I hop?
Tll m what I am to do, dar princss!” h addd aftr a paus, and
touchd hr hand as sh did not rply.
“I am thinking of what you hav told m,” answrd Princss Mary.
“This is what I will say. You ar right that to spak to hr of lov at
prsnt...”
Princss Mary stoppd. Sh was going to say that to spak of lov was
impossibl, but sh stoppd bcaus sh had sn by th suddn chang
in Natásha two days bfor that sh would not only not b hurt if Pirr
spok of his lov, but that it was th vry thing sh wishd for.
“To spak to hr now wouldn’t do,” said th princss all th sam.
“But what am I to do?”
“Lav it to m,” said Princss Mary. “I know...”
Pirr was looking into Princss Mary’s ys.
“Wll?... Wll?...” h said.
“I know that sh lovs... will lov you,” Princss Mary corrctd
hrslf.
Bfor hr words wr out, Pirr had sprung up and with a frightnd
xprssion sizd Princss Mary’s hand.
“What maks you think so? You think I may hop? You think...?”
“Ys, I think so,” said Princss Mary with a smil. “Writ to hr
parnts, and lav it to m. I will tll hr whn I can. I wish it to
happn and my hart tlls m it will.”
“No, it cannot b! How happy I am! But it can’t b.... How happy I am!
No, it can’t b!” Pirr kpt saying as h kissd Princss Mary’s hands.
“Go to Ptrsburg, that will b bst. And I will writ to you,” sh
said.
“To Ptrsburg? Go thr? Vry wll, I’ll go. But I may com again
tomorrow?”
Nxt day Pirr cam to say good-by. Natásha was lss animatd than
sh had bn th day bfor; but that day as h lookd at hr Pirr
somtims flt as if h was vanishing and that nithr h nor sh
xistd any longr, that nothing xistd but happinss. “Is it possibl?
No, it can’t b,” h told himslf at vry look, gstur, and word that
filld his soul with joy.
Whn on saying good-by h took hr thin, slndr hand, h could not hlp
holding it a littl longr in his own.
“Is it possibl that this hand, that fac, thos ys, all this trasur
of fminin charm so strang to m now, is it possibl that it will on
day b min forvr, as familiar to m as I am to myslf?... No, that’s
impossibl!...”
“Good-by, Count,” sh said aloud. “I shall look forward vry much to
your rturn,” sh addd in a whispr.
And ths simpl words, hr look, and th xprssion on hr fac which
accompanid thm, formd for two months th subjct of inxhaustibl
mmoris, intrprtations, and happy mditations for Pirr. “‘I shall
look forward vry much to your rturn....’ Ys, ys, how did sh say it?
Ys, ‘I shall look forward vry much to your rturn.’ Oh, how happy I
am! What is happning to m? How happy I am!” said Pirr to himslf.
CHAPTR XIX
Thr was nothing in Pirr’s soul now at all lik what had troubld it
during his courtship of Hlèn.
H did not rpat to himslf with a sickning fling of sham th words
h had spokn, or say: “Oh, why did I not say that?” and, “Whatvr mad
m say ‘J vous aim’?” On th contrary, h now rpatd in imagination
vry word that h or Natásha had spokn and picturd vry dtail of
hr fac and smil, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but
only to rpat it again and again. Thr was now not a shadow of doubt
in his mind as to whthr what h had undrtakn was right or wrong.
Only on trribl doubt somtims crossd his mind: “Wasn’t it all
a dram? Isn’t Princss Mary mistakn? Am I not too concitd and
slf-confidnt? I bliv all this—and suddnly Princss Mary will tll
hr, and sh will b sur to smil and say: ‘How strang! H must b
dluding himslf. Dosn’t h know that h is a man, just a man, whil
I...? I am somthing altogthr diffrnt and highr.’”
That was th only doubt oftn troubling Pirr. H did not now mak any
plans. Th happinss bfor him appard so inconcivabl that if only
h could attain it, it would b th nd of all things. vrything ndd
with that.
A joyful, unxpctd frnzy, of which h had thought himslf incapabl,
possssd him. Th whol maning of lif—not for him alon but for th
whol world—smd to him cntrd in his lov and th possibility of
bing lovd by hr. At tims vrybody smd to him to b occupid with
on thing only—his futur happinss. Somtims it smd to him that
othr popl wr all as plasd as h was himslf and mrly trid to
hid that plasur by prtnding to b busy with othr intrsts. In
vry word and gstur h saw allusions to his happinss. H oftn
surprisd thos h mt by his significantly happy looks and smils which
smd to xprss a scrt undrstanding btwn him and thm. And whn
h ralizd that popl might not b awar of his happinss, h pitid
thm with his whol hart and flt a dsir somhow to xplain to thm
that all that occupid thm was a mr frivolous trifl unworthy of
attntion.
Whn it was suggstd to him that h should ntr th civil srvic,
or whn th war or any gnral political affairs wr discussd on th
assumption that vrybody’s wlfar dpndd on this or that issu
of vnts, h would listn with a mild and pitying smil and surpris
popl by his strang commnts. But at this tim h saw vrybody—both
thos who, as h imagind, undrstood th ral maning of lif (that
is, what h was fling) and thos unfortunats who vidntly did not
undrstand it—in th bright light of th motion that shon within
himslf, and at onc without any ffort saw in vryon h mt
vrything that was good and worthy of bing lovd.
Whn daling with th affairs and paprs of his dad wif, hr mmory
arousd in him no fling but pity that sh had not known th bliss h
now knw. Princ Vasíli, who having obtaind a nw post and som
frsh dcorations was particularly proud at this tim, smd to him a
pathtic, kindly old man much to b pitid.
Oftn in aftrlif Pirr rcalld this priod of blissful insanity. All
th viws h formd of mn and circumstancs at this tim rmaind tru
for him always. H not only did not rnounc thm subsquntly, but whn
h was in doubt or inwardly at varianc, h rfrrd to th viws h had
hld at this tim of his madnss and thy always provd corrct.
“I may hav appard strang and qur thn,” h thought, “but I was
not so mad as I smd. On th contrary I was thn wisr and had
mor insight than at any othr tim, and undrstood all that is worth
undrstanding in lif, bcaus... bcaus I was happy.”
Pirr’s insanity consistd in not waiting, as h usd to do, to
discovr prsonal attributs which h trmd “good qualitis” in popl
bfor loving thm; his hart was now ovrflowing with lov, and by
loving popl without caus h discovrd indubitabl causs for loving
thm.
CHAPTR XX
Aftr Pirr’s dpartur that first vning, whn Natásha had said to
Princss Mary with a gaily mocking smil: “H looks just, ys, just as
if h had com out of a Russian bath—in a short coat and with his hair
croppd,” somthing hiddn and unknown to hrslf, but irrprssibl,
awok in Natásha’s soul.
vrything: hr fac, walk, look, and voic, was suddnly altrd.
To hr own surpris a powr of lif and hop of happinss ros to th
surfac and dmandd satisfaction. From that vning sh smd to hav
forgottn all that had happnd to hr. Sh no longr complaind of hr
position, did not say a word about th past, and no longr fard to
mak happy plans for th futur. Sh spok littl of Pirr, but whn
Princss Mary mntiond him a long-xtinguishd light onc mor kindld
in hr ys and hr lips curvd with a strang smil.
Th chang that took plac in Natásha at first surprisd Princss Mary;
but whn sh undrstood its maning it grivd hr. “Can sh hav lovd
my brothr so littl as to b abl to forgt him so soon?” sh thought
whn sh rflctd on th chang. But whn sh was with Natásha sh was
not vxd with hr and did not rproach hr. Th rawaknd powr
of lif that had sizd Natásha was so vidntly irrprssibl and
unxpctd by hr that in hr prsnc Princss Mary flt that sh had
no right to rproach hr vn in hr hart.
Natásha gav hrslf up so fully and frankly to this nw fling that
sh did not try to hid th fact that sh was no longr sad, but bright
and chrful.
Whn Princss Mary rturnd to hr room aftr hr nocturnal talk with
Pirr, Natásha mt hr on th thrshold.
“H has spokn? Ys? H has spokn?” sh rpatd.
And a joyful yt pathtic xprssion which smd to bg forgivnss for
hr joy sttld on Natásha’s fac.
“I wantd to listn at th door, but I knw you would tll m.”
Undrstandabl and touching as th look with which Natásha gazd at
hr smd to Princss Mary, and sorry as sh was to s hr agitation,
ths words paind hr for a momnt. Sh rmmbrd hr brothr and his
lov.
“But what’s to b don? Sh can’t hlp it,” thought th princss.
And with a sad and rathr strn look sh told Natásha all that Pirr
had said. On haring that h was going to Ptrsburg Natásha was
astoundd.
“To Ptrsburg!” sh rpatd as if unabl to undrstand.
But noticing th grivd xprssion on Princss Mary’s fac sh gussd
th rason of that sadnss and suddnly bgan to cry.
“Mary,” said sh, “tll m what I should do! I am afraid of bing bad.
Whatvr you tll m, I will do. Tll m....”
“You lov him?”
“Ys,” whisprd Natásha.
“Thn why ar you crying? I am happy for your sak,” said Princss Mary,
who bcaus of thos tars quit forgav Natásha’s joy.
“It won’t b just yt—somday. Think what fun it will b whn I am his
wif and you marry Nicholas!”
“Natásha, I hav askd you not to spak of that. Lt us talk about you.”
Thy wr silnt awhil.
“But why go to Ptrsburg?” Natásha suddnly askd, and hastily rplid
to hr own qustion. “But no, no, h must... Ys, Mary, H must....”
FIRST PILOGU: 1813 - 20
CHAPTR I
Svn yars had passd. Th storm-tossd sa of uropan history had
subsidd within its shors and smd to hav bcom calm. But th
mystrious forcs that mov humanity (mystrious bcaus th laws of
thir motion ar unknown to us) continud to oprat.
Though th surfac of th sa of history smd motionlss, th movmnt
of humanity wnt on as uncasingly as th flow of tim. Various groups
of popl formd and dissolvd, th coming formation and dissolution of
kingdoms and displacmnt of popls was in cours of prparation.
Th sa of history was not drivn spasmodically from shor to shor as
prviously. It was sthing in its dpths. Historic figurs wr not
born by th wavs from on shor to anothr as bfor. Thy now smd
to rotat on on spot. Th historical figurs at th had of armis,
who formrly rflctd th movmnt of th masss by ordring wars,
campaigns, and battls, now rflctd th rstlss movmnt by political
and diplomatic combinations, laws, and tratis.
Th historians call this activity of th historical figurs “th
raction.”
In daling with this priod thy strnly condmn th historical
prsonags who, in thir opinion, causd what thy dscrib as th
raction. All th wll-known popl of that priod, from Alxandr and
Napolon to Madam d Staël, Photius, Schlling, Ficht, Chataubriand,
and th rst, pass bfor thir strn judgmnt sat and ar acquittd or
condmnd according to whthr thy conducd to progrss or to raction.
According to thir accounts a raction took plac at that tim in Russia
also, and th chif culprit was Alxandr I, th sam man who according
to thm was th chif caus of th libral movmnt at th commncmnt
of his rign, bing th savior of Russia.
Thr is no on in Russian litratur now, from schoolboy ssayist to
larnd historian, who dos not throw his littl ston at Alxandr for
things h did wrong at this priod of his rign.
“H ought to hav actd in this way and in that way. In this cas h did
wll and in that cas badly. H bhavd admirably at th bginning of
his rign and during 1812, but actd badly by giving a constitution
to Poland, forming th Holy Allianc, ntrusting powr to Arakchv,
favoring Golítsyn and mysticism, and aftrwards Shishkóv and Photius.
H also actd badly by concrning himslf with th activ army and
disbanding th Smënov rgimnt.”
It would tak a dozn pags to numrat all th rproachs th
historians addrss to him, basd on thir knowldg of what is good for
humanity.
What do ths rproachs man?
Do not th vry actions for which th historians prais Alxandr I
(th libral attmpts at th bginning of his rign, his struggl with
Napolon, th firmnss h displayd in 1812 and th campaign of 1813)
flow from th sam sourcs—th circumstancs of his birth, ducation,
and lif—that mad his prsonality what it was and from which th
actions for which thy blam him (th Holy Allianc, th rstoration of
Poland, and th raction of 1820 and latr) also flowd?
In what dos th substanc of thos rproachs li?
It lis in th fact that an historic charactr lik Alxandr I,
standing on th highst possibl pinnacl of human powr with th
blinding light of history focusd upon him; a charactr xposd to thos
strongst of all influncs: th intrigus, flattry, and slf-dcption
insparabl from powr; a charactr who at vry momnt of his lif
flt a rsponsibility for all that was happning in urop; and not
a fictitious but a liv charactr who lik vry man had his prsonal
habits, passions, and impulss toward goodnss, bauty, and truth—that
this charactr—though not lacking in virtu (th historians do not
accus him of that)—had not th sam concption of th wlfar of
humanity fifty yars ago as a prsnt-day profssor who from his
youth upwards has bn occupid with larning: that is, with books and
lcturs and with taking nots from thm.
But vn if w assum that fifty yars ago Alxandr I was mistakn in
his viw of what was good for th popl, w must invitably assum that
th historian who judgs Alxandr will also aftr th laps of som
tim turn out to b mistakn in his viw of what is good for humanity.
This assumption is all th mor natural and invitabl bcaus, watching
th movmnt of history, w s that vry yar and with ach nw
writr, opinion as to what is good for mankind changs; so that what
onc smd good, tn yars latr sms bad, and vic vrsa. And what is
mor, w find at on and th sam tim quit contradictory viws as to
what is bad and what is good in history: som popl rgard giving a
constitution to Poland and forming th Holy Allianc as praisworthy in
Alxandr, whil othrs rgard it as blamworthy.
Th activity of Alxandr or of Napolon cannot b calld usful or
harmful, for it is impossibl to say for what it was usful or harmful.
If that activity displass sombody, this is only bcaus it dos
not agr with his limitd undrstanding of what is good. Whthr th
prsrvation of my fathr’s hous in Moscow, or th glory of th Russian
arms, or th prosprity of th Ptrsburg and othr univrsitis, or th
frdom of Poland or th gratnss of Russia, or th balanc of powr in
urop, or a crtain kind of uropan cultur calld “progrss” appar
to m to b good or bad, I must admit that bsids ths things th
action of vry historic charactr has othr mor gnral purposs
inaccssibl to m.
But lt us assum that what is calld scinc can harmoniz all
contradictions and posssss an unchanging standard of good and bad by
which to try historic charactrs and vnts; lt us say that Alxandr
could hav don vrything diffrntly; lt us say that with guidanc
from thos who blam him and who profss to know th ultimat aim of th
movmnt of humanity, h might hav arrangd mattrs according to
th program his prsnt accusrs would hav givn him—of nationality,
frdom, quality, and progrss (ths, I think, covr th ground). Lt
us assum that this program was possibl and had thn bn formulatd,
and that Alxandr had actd on it. What would thn hav bcom of th
activity of all thos who opposd th tndncy that thn prvaild in
th govrnmnt—an activity that in th opinion of th historians was
good and bnficnt? Thir activity would not hav xistd: thr would
hav bn no lif, thr would hav bn nothing.
If w admit that human lif can b ruld by rason, th possibility of
lif is dstroyd.
CHAPTR II
If w assum as th historians do that grat mn lad humanity to th
attainmnt of crtain nds—th gratnss of Russia or of Franc,
th balanc of powr in urop, th diffusion of th idas of th
Rvolution, gnral progrss, or anything ls—thn it is impossibl
to xplain th facts of history without introducing th concptions of
chanc and gnius.
If th aim of th uropan wars at th bginning of th nintnth
cntury had bn th aggrandizmnt of Russia, that aim might hav bn
accomplishd without all th prcding wars and without th invasion. If
th aim was th aggrandizmnt of Franc, that might hav bn attaind
without th Rvolution and without th mpir. If th aim was th
dissmination of idas, th printing prss could hav accomplishd that
much bttr than warfar. If th aim was th progrss of civilization,
it is asy to s that thr ar othr ways of diffusing civilization
mor xpdint than by th dstruction of walth and of human livs.
Why did it happn in this and not in som othr way?
Bcaus it happnd so! “Chanc cratd th situation; gnius utilizd
it,” says history.
But what is chanc? What is gnius?
Th words chanc and gnius do not dnot any rally xisting thing and
thrfor cannot b dfind. Thos words only dnot a crtain stag of
undrstanding of phnomna. I do not know why a crtain vnt occurs; I
think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about
chanc. I s a forc producing ffcts byond th scop of ordinary
human agncis; I do not undrstand why this occurs and I talk of
gnius.
To a hrd of rams, th ram th hrdsman drivs ach vning into a
spcial nclosur to fd and that bcoms twic as fat as th othrs
must sm to b a gnius. And it must appar an astonishing conjunction
of gnius with a whol sris of xtraordinary chancs that this ram,
who instad of gtting into th gnral fold vry vning gos into a
spcial nclosur whr thr ar oats—that this vry ram, swlling with
fat, is killd for mat.
But th rams nd only cas to suppos that all that happns to thm
happns solly for th attainmnt of thir shpish aims; thy nd only
admit that what happns to thm may also hav purposs byond thir kn,
and thy will at onc prciv a unity and cohrnc in what happnd
to th ram that was fattnd. vn if thy do not know for what purpos
thy ar fattnd, thy will at last know that all that happnd to th
ram did not happn accidntally, and will no longr nd th concptions
of chanc or gnius.
Only by rnouncing our claim to discrn a purpos immdiatly
intlligibl to us, and admitting th ultimat purpos to b byond our
kn, may w discrn th squnc of xprincs in th livs of
historic charactrs and prciv th caus of th ffct thy produc
(incommnsurabl with ordinary human capabilitis), and thn th words
chanc and gnius bcom suprfluous.
W nd only confss that w do not know th purpos of th uropan
convulsions and that w know only th facts—that is, th murdrs, first
in Franc, thn in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain,
and in Russia—and that th movmnts from th wst to th ast and from
th ast to th wst form th ssnc and purpos of ths vnts, and
not only shall w hav no nd to s xcptional ability and gnius in
Napolon and Alxandr, but w shall b unabl to considr thm to
b anything but lik othr mn, and w shall not b obligd to hav
rcours to chanc for an xplanation of thos small vnts which mad
ths popl what thy wr, but it will b clar that all thos small
vnts wr invitabl.
By discarding a claim to knowldg of th ultimat purpos, w shall
clarly prciv that just as on cannot imagin a blossom or sd for
any singl plant bttr suitd to it than thos it producs, so it is
impossibl to imagin any two popl mor compltly adaptd down to th
smallst dtail for th purpos thy had to fulfill, than Napolon and
Alxandr with all thir antcdnts.
CHAPTR III
Th fundamntal and ssntial significanc of th uropan vnts of th
bginning of th nintnth cntury lis in th movmnt of th mass of
th uropan popls from wst to ast and aftrwards from ast to wst.
Th commncmnt of that movmnt was th movmnt from wst to ast.
For th popls of th wst to b abl to mak thir warlik movmnt
to Moscow it was ncssary: (1) that thy should form thmslvs into
a military group of a siz abl to ndur a collision with th warlik
military group of th ast, (2) that thy should abandon all stablishd
traditions and customs, and (3) that during thir military movmnt thy
should hav at thir had a man who could justify to himslf and to thm
th dcptions, robbris, and murdrs which would hav to b committd
during that movmnt.
And bginning with th Frnch Rvolution th old inadquatly larg
group was dstroyd, as wll as th old habits and traditions, and stp
by stp a group was formd of largr dimnsions with nw customs and
traditions, and a man was producd who would stand at th had of th
coming movmnt and bar th rsponsibility for all that had to b don.
A man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without
a nam, and not vn a Frnchman, mrgs—by what sm th strangst
chancs—from among all th sthing Frnch partis, and without joining
anyon of thm is born forward to a prominnt position.
Th ignoranc of his collagus, th waknss and insignificanc of
his opponnts, th franknss of his falshoods, and th dazzling and
slf-confidnt limitations of this man rais him to th had of th
army. Th brilliant qualitis of th soldirs of th army snt to Italy,
his opponnts’ rluctanc to fight, and his own childish audacity and
slf-confidnc scur him military fam. Innumrabl so-calld chancs
accompany him vrywhr. Th disfavor into which h falls with th
rulrs of Franc turns to his advantag. His attmpts to avoid his
prdstind path ar unsuccssful: h is not rcivd into th Russian
srvic, and th appointmnt h sks in Turky coms to nothing. During
th war in Italy h is svral tims on th vrg of dstruction and
ach tim is savd in an unxpctd mannr. Owing to various diplomatic
considrations th Russian armis—just thos which might hav dstroyd
his prstig—do not appar upon th scn till h is no longr thr.
On his rturn from Italy h finds th govrnmnt in Paris in a procss
of dissolution in which all thos who ar in it ar invitably wipd
out and dstroyd. And by chanc an scap from this dangrous position
prsnts itslf in th form of an aimlss and snslss xpdition
to Africa. Again so-calld chanc accompanis him. Imprgnabl Malta
surrndrs without a shot; his most rcklss schms ar crownd with
succss. Th nmy’s flt, which subsquntly did not lt a singl boat
pass, allows his ntir army to lud it. In Africa a whol sris of
outrags ar committd against th almost unarmd inhabitants. And th
mn who commit ths crims, spcially thir ladr, assur thmslvs
that this is admirabl, this is glory—it rsmbls Casar and Alxandr
th Grat and is thrfor good.
This idal of glory and grandur—which consists not mrly in
considring nothing wrong that on dos but in priding onslf on vry
crim on commits, ascribing to it an incomprhnsibl suprnatural
significanc—that idal, dstind to guid this man and his associats,
had scop for its dvlopmnt in Africa. Whatvr h dos succds. Th
plagu dos not touch him. Th crulty of murdring prisonrs is not
imputd to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalld-for, and
ignobl dpartur from Africa, laving his comrads in distrss, is
st down to his crdit, and again th nmy’s flt twic lts him slip
past. Whn, intoxicatd by th crims h has committd so succssfully,
h rachs Paris, th dissolution of th rpublican govrnmnt, which a
yar arlir might hav ruind him, has rachd its xtrm limit, and
his prsnc thr now as a nwcomr fr from party ntanglmnts can
only srv to xalt him—and though h himslf has no plan, h is quit
rady for his nw rôl.
H had no plan, h was afraid of vrything, but th partis snatchd at
him and dmandd his participation.
H alon—with his idal of glory and grandur dvlopd in Italy and
gypt, his insan slf-adulation, his boldnss in crim and franknss in
lying—h alon could justify what had to b don.
H is ndd for th plac that awaits him, and so almost apart from
his will and dspit his indcision, his lack of a plan, and all his
mistaks, h is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at sizing powr and
th conspiracy is crownd with succss.
H is pushd into a mting of th lgislatur. In alarm h wishs to
fl, considring himslf lost. H prtnds to fall into a swoon and
says snslss things that should hav ruind him. But th onc proud
and shrwd rulrs of Franc, fling that thir part is playd out, ar
vn mor bwildrd than h, and do not say th words thy should hav
said to dstroy him and rtain thir powr.
Chanc, millions of chancs, giv him powr, and all mn as if by
agrmnt co-oprat to confirm that powr. Chanc forms th charactrs
of th rulrs of Franc, who submit to him; chanc forms th charactr
of Paul I of Russia who rcognizs his govrnmnt; chanc contrivs
a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his
powr. Chanc puts th Duc d’nghin in his hands and unxpctdly
causs him to kill him—thrby convincing th mob mor forcibly than
in any othr way that h had th right, sinc h had th might.
Chanc contrivs that though h dircts all his fforts to prpar an
xpdition against ngland (which would invitably hav ruind him) h
nvr carris out that intntion, but unxpctdly falls upon Mack and
th Austrians, who surrndr without a battl. Chanc and gnius giv
him th victory at Austrlitz; and by chanc all mn, not only th
Frnch but all urop—xcpt ngland which dos not tak part in th
vnts about to happn—dspit thir formr horror and dtstation of
his crims, now rcogniz his authority, th titl h has givn
himslf, and his idal of grandur and glory, which sms xcllnt and
rasonabl to thm all.
As if masuring thmslvs and prparing for th coming movmnt, th
wstrn forcs push toward th ast svral tims in 1805, 1806, 1807,
and 1809, gaining strngth and growing. In 1811 th group of popl that
had formd in Franc units into on group with th popls of Cntral
urop. Th strngth of th justification of th man who stands at th
had of th movmnt grows with th incrasd siz of th group. During
th tn-yar prparatory priod this man had formd rlations with all
th crownd hads of urop. Th discrditd rulrs of th world can
oppos no rasonabl idal to th insnsat Napolonic idal of
glory and grandur. On aftr anothr thy hastn to display thir
insignificanc bfor him. Th King of Prussia snds his wif to sk
th grat man’s mrcy; th mpror of Austria considrs it a favor that
this man rcivs a daughtr of th Casars into his bd; th Pop, th
guardian of all that th nations hold sacrd, utilizs rligion for th
aggrandizmnt of th grat man. It is not Napolon who prpars himslf
for th accomplishmnt of his rol, so much as all thos round him who
prpar him to tak on himslf th whol rsponsibility for what is
happning and has to happn. Thr is no stp, no crim or ptty fraud
h commits, which in th mouths of thos around him is not at onc
rprsntd as a grat dd. Th most suitabl fêt th Grmans can
dvis for him is a clbration of Jna and Aurstädt. Not only is h
grat, but so ar his ancstors, his brothrs, his stpsons, and his
brothrs-in-law. vrything is don to dpriv him of th rmains of his
rason and to prpar him for his trribl part. And whn h is rady so
too ar th forcs.
Th invasion pushs astward and rachs its final goal—Moscow. That
city is takn; th Russian army suffrs havir losss than th opposing
armis had suffrd in th formr war from Austrlitz to Wagram. But
suddnly instad of thos chancs and that gnius which hithrto had
so consistntly ld him by an unintrruptd sris of succsss to th
prdstind goal, an innumrabl squnc of invrs chancs occur—from
th cold in his had at Borodinó to th sparks which st Moscow on
fir, and th frosts—and instad of gnius, stupidity and immasurabl
basnss bcom vidnt.
Th invadrs fl, turn back, fl again, and all th chancs ar now
not for Napolon but always against him.
A countrmovmnt is thn accomplishd from ast to wst with a
rmarkabl rsmblanc to th prcding movmnt from wst to ast.
Attmptd drivs from ast to wst—similar to th contrary movmnts of
1805, 1807, and 1809—prcd th grat wstward movmnt; thr is th
sam coalscnc into a group of normous dimnsions; th sam adhsion
of th popl of Cntral urop to th movmnt; th sam hsitation
midway, and th sam incrasing rapidity as th goal is approachd.
Paris, th ultimat goal, is rachd. Th Napolonic govrnmnt and army
ar dstroyd. Napolon himslf is no longr of any account; all his
actions ar vidntly pitiful and man, but again an inxplicabl chanc
occurs. Th allis dtst Napolon whom thy rgard as th caus of
thir suffrings. Dprivd of powr and authority, his crims and his
craft xposd, h should hav appard to thm what h appard tn
yars prviously and on yar latr—an outlawd brigand. But by som
strang chanc no on prcivs this. His part is not yt ndd. Th man
who tn yars bfor and a yar latr was considrd an outlawd brigand
is snt to an island two days’ sail from Franc, which for som rason
is prsntd to him as his dominion, and guards ar givn to him and
millions of mony ar paid him.
CHAPTR IV
Th flood of nations bgins to subsid into its normal channls. Th
wavs of th grat movmnt abat, and on th calm surfac ddis ar
formd in which float th diplomatists, who imagin that thy hav
causd th floods to abat.
But th smooth sa again suddnly bcoms disturbd. Th diplomatists
think that thir disagrmnts ar th caus of this frsh prssur
of natural forcs; thy anticipat war btwn thir sovrigns; th
position sms to thm insolubl. But th wav thy fl to b rising
dos not com from th quartr thy xpct. It riss again from th sam
point as bfor—Paris. Th last backwash of th movmnt from th wst
occurs: a backwash which srvs to solv th apparntly insuprabl
diplomatic difficultis and nds th military movmnt of that priod of
history.
Th man who had dvastatd Franc rturns to Franc alon, without any
conspiracy and without soldirs. Any guard might arrst him, but by
strang chanc no on dos so and all rapturously grt th man thy
cursd th day bfor and will curs again a month latr.
This man is still ndd to justify th final collctiv act.
That act is prformd.
Th last rôl is playd. Th actor is biddn to disrob and wash off his
powdr and paint: h will not b wantd any mor.
And som yars pass during which h plays a pitiful comdy to himslf
in solitud on his island, justifying his actions by intrigus and lis
whn th justification is no longr ndd, and displaying to th whol
world what it was that popl had mistakn for strngth as long as an
unsn hand dirctd his actions.
Th managr having brought th drama to a clos and strippd th actor
shows him to us.
“S what you blivd in! This is h! Do you now s that it was not h
but I who movd you?”
But dazd by th forc of th movmnt, it was long bfor popl
undrstood this.
Still gratr cohrnc and invitability is sn in th lif of
Alxandr I, th man who stood at th had of th countrmovmnt from
ast to wst.
What was ndd for him who, ovrshadowing othrs, stood at th had of
that movmnt from ast to wst?
What was ndd was a sns of justic and a sympathy with uropan
affairs, but a rmot sympathy not dulld by ptty intrsts; a moral
supriority ovr thos sovrigns of th day who co-opratd with him;
a mild and attractiv prsonality; and a prsonal grivanc against
Napolon. And all this was found in Alxandr I; all this had bn
prpard by innumrabl so-calld chancs in his lif: his ducation,
his arly libralism, th advisrs who surroundd him, and by
Austrlitz, and Tilsit, and rfurt.
During th national war h was inactiv bcaus h was not ndd. But
as soon as th ncssity for a gnral uropan war prsntd itslf h
appard in his plac at th givn momnt and, uniting th nations of
urop, ld thm to th goal.
Th goal is rachd. Aftr th final war of 1815 Alxandr posssss all
possibl powr. How dos h us it?
Alxandr I—th pacifir of urop, th man who from his arly yars
had strivn only for his popl’s wlfar, th originator of th libral
innovations in his fathrland—now that h smd to possss th utmost
powr and thrfor to hav th possibility of bringing about th
wlfar of his popls—at th tim whn Napolon in xil was drawing
up childish and mndacious plans of how h would hav mad mankind happy
had h rtaind powr—Alxandr I, having fulfilld his mission and
fling th hand of God upon him, suddnly rcognizs th insignificanc
of that supposd powr, turns away from it, and givs it into th hands
of contmptibl mn whom h dspiss, saying only:
“Not unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Nam!... I too am a man lik th
rst of you. Lt m liv lik a man and think of my soul and of God.”
As th sun and ach atom of thr is a sphr complt in itslf, and
yt at th sam tim only a part of a whol too immns for man to
comprhnd, so ach individual has within himslf his own aims and yt
has thm to srv a gnral purpos incomprhnsibl to man.
A b sttling on a flowr has stung a child. And th child is afraid
of bs and dclars that bs xist to sting popl. A pot admirs th

Anothr bkpr who has studid th lif of th hiv mor closly

All that is accssibl to man is th rlation of th lif of th b to

CHAPTR V
Natásha’s wdding to Bzúkhov, which took plac in 1813, was th last
happy vnt in th family of th old Rostóvs. Count Ilyá Rostóv did
that sam yar and, as always happns, aftr th fathr’s dath th
family group brok up.
Th vnts of th prvious yar: th burning of Moscow and th flight
from it, th dath of Princ Andrw, Natásha’s dspair, Ptya’s dath,
and th old countss’ grif fll blow aftr blow on th old count’s
had. H smd to b unabl to undrstand th maning of all ths
vnts, and bowd his old had in a spiritual sns as if xpcting and
inviting furthr blows which would finish him. H smd now frightnd
and distraught and now unnaturally animatd and ntrprising.
Th arrangmnts for Natásha’s marriag occupid him for a whil. H
ordrd dinnrs and supprs and obviously trid to appar chrful, but
his chrfulnss was not infctious as it usd to b: on th contrary it
vokd th compassion of thos who knw and likd him.
Whn Pirr and his wif had lft, h grw vry quit and bgan to
complain of dprssion. A fw days latr h fll ill and took to his
bd. H ralizd from th first that h would not gt up again, dspit
th doctor’s ncouragmnt. Th countss passd a fortnight in an
armchair by his pillow without undrssing. vry tim sh gav him
his mdicin h sobbd and silntly kissd hr hand. On his last day,
sobbing, h askd hr and his absnt son to forgiv him for having
dissipatd thir proprty—that bing th chif fault of which h was
conscious. Aftr rciving communion and unction h quitly did; and
nxt day a throng of acquaintancs who cam to pay thir last rspcts
to th dcasd filld th hous rntd by th Rostóvs. All ths
acquaintancs, who had so oftn dind and dancd at his hous and had so
oftn laughd at him, now said, with a common fling of slf-rproach
and motion, as if justifying thmslvs: “Wll, whatvr h may hav
bn h was a most worthy man. You don’t mt such mn nowadays.... And
which of us has not waknsss of his own?”
It was just whn th count’s affairs had bcom so involvd that it was
impossibl to say what would happn if h livd anothr yar that h
unxpctdly did.
Nicholas was with th Russian army in Paris whn th nws of his
fathr’s dath rachd him. H at onc rsignd his commission, and
without waiting for it to b accptd took lav of absnc and wnt to
Moscow. Th stat of th count’s affairs bcam quit obvious a month
aftr his dath, surprising vryon by th immns total of small
dbts th xistnc of which no on had suspctd. Th dbts amountd to
doubl th valu of th proprty.
Frinds and rlations advisd Nicholas to dclin th inhritanc. But
h rgardd such a rfusal as a slur on his fathr’s mmory, which h
hld sacrd, and thrfor would not har of rfusing and accptd th
inhritanc togthr with th obligation to pay th dbts.
Th crditors who had so long bn silnt, rstraind by a vagu
but powrful influnc xrtd on thm whil h livd by th count’s
carlss good natur, all procdd to nforc thir claims at onc. As
always happns in such cass rivalry sprang up as to which should gt
paid first, and thos who lik Mítnka hld promissory nots givn thm
as prsnts now bcam th most xacting of th crditors. Nicholas was
allowd no rspit and no pac, and thos who had smd to pity
th old man—th caus of thir losss (if thy wr losss)—now
rmorslssly pursud th young hir who had voluntarily undrtakn th
dbts and was obviously not guilty of contracting thm.
Not on of th plans Nicholas trid succdd; th stat was sold by
auction for half its valu, and half th dbts still rmaind
unpaid. Nicholas accptd thirty thousand rubls offrd him by his
brothr-in-law Bzúkhov to pay off dbts h rgardd as gnuinly du
for valu rcivd. And to avoid bing imprisond for th rmaindr, as
th crditors thratnd, h r-ntrd th govrnmnt srvic.
H could not rjoin th army whr h would hav bn mad colonl at
th nxt vacancy, for his mothr now clung to him as hr on hold on
lif; and so dspit his rluctanc to rmain in Moscow among popl who
had known him bfor, and dspit his abhorrnc of th civil srvic,
h accptd a post in Moscow in that srvic, doffd th uniform of
which h was so fond, and movd with his mothr and Sónya to a small
hous on th Sívtsv Vrazhók.
Natásha and Pirr wr living in Ptrsburg at th tim and had no
clar ida of Nicholas’ circumstancs. Having borrowd mony from his
brothr-in-law, Nicholas trid to hid his wrtchd condition from him.
His position was th mor difficult bcaus with his salary of twlv
hundrd rubls h had not only to kp himslf, his mothr, and Sónya,
but had to shild his mothr from knowldg of thir povrty. Th
countss could not conciv of lif without th luxurious conditions sh
had bn usd to from childhood and, unabl to raliz how hard it was
for hr son, kpt dmanding now a carriag (which thy did not kp) to
snd for a frind, now som xpnsiv articl of food for hrslf, or
win for hr son, or mony to buy a prsnt as a surpris for Natásha or
Sónya, or for Nicholas himslf.
Sónya kpt hous, attndd on hr aunt, rad to hr, put up with hr
whims and scrt ill-will, and hlpd Nicholas to concal thir povrty
from th old countss. Nicholas flt himslf irrdmably indbtd
to Sónya for all sh was doing for his mothr and gratly admird hr
patinc and dvotion, but trid to kp aloof from hr.
H smd in his hart to rproach hr for bing too prfct, and
bcaus thr was nothing to rproach hr with. Sh had all that popl
ar valud for, but littl that could hav mad him lov hr. H flt
that th mor h valud hr th lss h lovd hr. H had takn hr at
hr word whn sh wrot giving him his frdom and now bhavd as if all
that had passd btwn thm had bn long forgottn and could nvr in
any cas b rnwd.
Nicholas’ position bcam wors and wors. Th ida of putting somthing
asid out of his salary provd a dram. Not only did h not sav
anything, but to comply with his mothr’s dmands h vn incurrd som
small dbts. H could s no way out of this situation. Th ida of
marrying som rich woman, which was suggstd to him by his fmal
rlations, was rpugnant to him. Th othr way out—his mothr’s
dath—nvr ntrd his had. H wishd for nothing and hopd
for nothing, and dp in his hart xprincd a gloomy and strn
satisfaction in an uncomplaining nduranc of his position. H trid
to avoid his old acquaintancs with thir commisration and offnsiv
offrs of assistanc; h avoidd all distraction and rcration, and
vn at hom did nothing but play cards with his mothr, pac silntly
up and down th room, and smok on pip aftr anothr. H smd
carfully to chrish within himslf th gloomy mood which alon nabld
him to ndur his position.
CHAPTR VI
At th bginning of wintr Princss Mary cam to Moscow. From rports
currnt in town sh larnd how th Rostóvs wr situatd, and how “th
son has sacrificd himslf for his mothr,” as popl wr saying.
“I nvr xpctd anything ls of him,” said Princss Mary to hrslf,
fling a joyous sns of hr lov for him. Rmmbring hr frindly
rlations with all th Rostóvs which had mad hr almost a mmbr of th
family, sh thought it hr duty to go to s thm. But rmmbring hr
rlations with Nicholas in Vorónzh sh was shy about doing so. Making
a grat ffort sh did howvr go to call on thm a fw wks aftr hr
arrival in Moscow.
Nicholas was th first to mt hr, as th countss’ room could only b
rachd through his. But instad of bing grtd with plasur as sh
had xpctd, at his first glanc at hr his fac assumd a cold, stiff,
proud xprssion sh had not sn on it bfor. H inquird about hr
halth, ld th way to his mothr, and having sat thr for fiv minuts
lft th room.
Whn th princss cam out of th countss’ room Nicholas mt hr again,
and with markd solmnity and stiffnss accompanid hr to th antroom.
To hr rmarks about his mothr’s halth h mad no rply. “What’s that
to you? Lav m in pac,” his looks smd to say.
“Why dos sh com prowling hr? What dos sh want? I can’t bar ths
ladis and all ths civilitis!” said h aloud in Sónya’s prsnc,
vidntly unabl to rprss his vxation, aftr th princss’ carriag
had disappard.
“Oh, Nicholas, how can you talk lik that?” crid Sónya, hardly abl to
concal hr dlight. “Sh is so kind and Mamma is so fond of hr!”
Nicholas did not rply and trid to avoid spaking of th princss any
mor. But aftr hr visit th old countss spok of hr svral tims a
day.
Sh sang hr praiss, insistd that hr son must call on hr, xprssd
a wish to s hr oftn, but yt always bcam ill-humord whn sh
bgan to talk about hr.
Nicholas trid to kp silnc whn his mothr spok of th princss,
but his silnc irritatd hr.
“Sh is a vry admirabl and xcllnt young woman,” said sh, “and you
must go and call on hr. You would at last b sing sombody, and I
think it must b dull for you only sing us.”
“But I don’t in th last want to, Mamma.”
“You usd to want to, and now you don’t. Rally I don’t undrstand you,
my dar. On day you ar dull, and th nxt you rfus to s anyon.”
“But I nvr said I was dull.”
“Why, you said yourslf you don’t want vn to s hr. Sh is a vry
admirabl young woman and you always likd hr, but now suddnly you
hav got som notion or othr in your had. You hid vrything from
m.”
“Not at all, Mamma.”
“If I wr asking you to do somthing disagrabl now—but I only ask
you to rturn a call. On would think mr politnss rquird it....
Wll, I hav askd you, and now I won’t intrfr any mor sinc you
hav scrts from your mothr.”
“Wll, thn, I’ll go if you wish it.”
“It dosn’t mattr to m. I only wish it for your sak.”
Nicholas sighd, bit his mustach, and laid out th cards for a
patinc, trying to divrt his mothr’s attntion to anothr topic.
Th sam convrsation was rpatd nxt day and th day aftr, and th
day aftr that.
Aftr hr visit to th Rostóvs and hr unxpctdly chilly rcption by
Nicholas, Princss Mary confssd to hrslf that sh had bn right in
not wishing to b th first to call.
“I xpctd nothing ls,” sh told hrslf, calling hr prid to hr
aid. “I hav nothing to do with him and I only wantd to s th
old lady, who was always kind to m and to whom I am undr many
obligations.”
But sh could not pacify hrslf with ths rflctions; a fling akin
to rmors troubld hr whn sh thought of hr visit. Though sh had
firmly rsolvd not to call on th Rostóvs again and to forgt th whol
mattr, sh flt hrslf all th tim in an awkward position. And whn
sh askd hrslf what distrssd hr, sh had to admit that it was hr
rlation to Rostóv. His cold, polit mannr did not xprss his fling
for hr (sh knw that) but it concald somthing, and until sh could
discovr what that somthing was, sh flt that sh could not b at
as.
On day in midwintr whn sitting in th schoolroom attnding to hr
nphw’s lssons, sh was informd that Rostóv had calld. With a firm
rsolution not to btray hrslf and not show hr agitation, sh snt
for Madmoisll Bourinn and wnt with hr to th drawing room.
Hr first glanc at Nicholas’ fac told hr that h had only com to
fulfill th dmands of politnss, and sh firmly rsolvd to maintain
th ton in which h addrssd hr.
Thy spok of th countss’ halth, of thir mutual frinds, of th
latst war nws, and whn th tn minuts rquird by proprity had
lapsd aftr which a visitor may ris, Nicholas got up to say good-by.
With Madmoisll Bourinn’s hlp th princss had maintaind th
convrsation vry wll, but at th vry last momnt, just whn h ros,
sh was so tird of talking of what did not intrst hr, and hr
mind was so full of th qustion why sh alon was grantd so littl
happinss in lif, that in a fit of absnt-minddnss sh sat still, hr
luminous ys gazing fixdly bfor hr, not noticing that h had risn.
Nicholas glancd at hr and, wishing to appar not to notic hr
abstraction, mad som rmark to Madmoisll Bourinn and thn
again lookd at th princss. Sh still sat motionlss with a look of
suffring on hr gntl fac. H suddnly flt sorry for hr and was
vaguly conscious that h might b th caus of th sadnss hr fac
xprssd. H wishd to hlp hr and say somthing plasant, but could
think of nothing to say.
“Good-by, Princss!” said h.
Sh startd, flushd, and sighd dply.
“Oh, I bg your pardon,” sh said as if waking up. “Ar you going
alrady, Count? Wll thn, good-by! Oh, but th cushion for th
countss!”
“Wait a momnt, I’ll ftch it,” said Madmoisll Bourinn, and sh
lft th room.
Thy both sat silnt, with an occasional glanc at on anothr.
“Ys, Princss,” said Nicholas at last with a sad smil, “it dosn’t
sm long ago sinc w first mt at Boguchárovo, but how much watr
has flowd sinc thn! In what distrss w all smd to b thn, yt
I would giv much to bring back that tim... but thr’s no bringing it
back.”
Princss Mary gazd intntly into his ys with hr own luminous ons
as h said this. Sh smd to b trying to fathom th hiddn maning of
his words which would xplain his fling for hr.
“Ys, ys,” said sh, “but you hav no rason to rgrt th past, Count.
As I undrstand your prsnt lif, I think you will always rcall it
with satisfaction, bcaus th slf-sacrific that fills it now...”
“I cannot accpt your prais,” h intrruptd hr hurridly. “On th
contrary I continually rproach myslf.... But this is not at all an
intrsting or chrful subjct.”
His fac again rsumd its formr stiff and cold xprssion. But th
princss had caught a glimps of th man sh had known and lovd, and it
was to him that sh now spok.
“I thought you would allow m to tll you this,” sh said. “I had com
so nar to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not
considr my sympathy misplacd, but I was mistakn,” and suddnly hr
voic trmbld. “I don’t know why,” sh continud, rcovring hrslf,
“but you usd to b diffrnt, and...”
“Thr ar a thousand rasons why,” laying spcial mphasis on th why.
“Thank you, Princss,” h addd softly. “Somtims it is hard.”
“So that’s why! That’s why!” a voic whisprd in Princss Mary’s soul.
“No, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that
handsom xtrior, that I lovd in him. I divind his nobl, rsolut,
slf-sacrificing spirit too,” sh said to hrslf. “Ys, h is poor now
and I am rich.... Ys, that’s th only rason.... Ys, wr it not for
that...” And rmmbring his formr tndrnss, and looking now at his
kind, sorrowful fac, sh suddnly undrstood th caus of his coldnss.
“But why, Count, why?” sh almost crid, unconsciously moving closr to
him. “Why? Tll m. You must tll m!”
H was silnt.
“I don’t undrstand your why, Count,” sh continud, “but it’s hard for
m... I confss it. For som rason you wish to dpriv m of our formr
frindship. And that hurts m.” Thr wr tars in hr ys and in hr
voic. “I hav had so littl happinss in lif that vry loss is hard
for m to bar.... xcus m, good-by!” and suddnly sh bgan to cry
and was hurrying from th room.
“Princss, for God’s sak!” h xclaimd, trying to stop hr.
“Princss!”
Sh turnd round. For a fw sconds thy gazd silntly into on
anothr’s ys—and what had smd impossibl and rmot suddnly bcam
possibl, invitabl, and vry nar.
CHAPTR VII
In th wintr of 1813 Nicholas marrid Princss Mary and movd to Bald
Hills with his wif, his mothr, and Sónya.
Within four yars h had paid off all his rmaining dbts without
slling any of his wif’s proprty, and having rcivd a small
inhritanc on th dath of a cousin h paid his dbt to Pirr as wll.
In anothr thr yars, by 1820, h had so managd his affairs that h
was abl to buy a small stat adjoining Bald Hills and was ngotiating
to buy back Otrádno—that bing his pt dram.
Having startd farming from ncssity, h soon grw so dvotd to it
that it bcam his favorit and almost his sol occupation. Nicholas was
a plain farmr: h did not lik innovations, spcially th nglish ons
thn coming into vogu. H laughd at thortical tratiss on stat
managmnt, dislikd factoris, th raising of xpnsiv products,
and th buying of xpnsiv sd corn, and did not mak a hobby of any
particular part of th work on his stat. H always had bfor his
mind’s y th stat as a whol and not any particular part of it. Th
chif thing in his ys was not th nitrogn in th soil, nor th oxygn
in th air, nor manurs, nor spcial plows, but that most important
agnt by which nitrogn, oxygn, manur, and plow wr mad
ffctiv—th pasant laborr. Whn Nicholas first bgan farming
and bgan to undrstand its diffrnt branchs, it was th srf who
spcially attractd his attntion. Th pasant smd to him not mrly
a tool, but also a judg of farming and an nd in himslf. At first
h watchd th srfs, trying to undrstand thir aims and what thy
considrd good and bad, and only prtndd to dirct thm and giv
ordrs whil in rality larning from thm thir mthods, thir mannr
of spch, and thir judgmnt of what was good and bad. Only whn h
had undrstood th pasants’ tasts and aspirations, had larnd to talk
thir languag, to grasp th hiddn maning of thir words, and flt
akin to thm did h bgin boldly to manag his srfs, that is, to
prform toward thm th dutis dmandd of him. And Nicholas’ managmnt
producd vry brilliant rsults.
Guidd by som gift of insight, on taking up th managmnt of th
stats h at onc unrringly appointd as bailiff, villag ldr, and
dlgat, th vry mn th srfs would thmslvs hav chosn had thy
had th right to choos, and ths posts nvr changd hands. Bfor
analyzing th proprtis of manur, bfor ntring into th dbit and
crdit (as h ironically calld it), h found out how many cattl th
pasants had and incrasd th numbr by all possibl mans. H kpt th
pasant familis togthr in th largst groups possibl, not allowing
th family groups to divid into sparat housholds. H was hard alik
on th lazy, th dpravd, and th wak, and trid to gt thm xplld
from th commun.
H was as carful of th sowing and raping of th pasants’ hay
and corn as of his own, and fw landownrs had thir crops sown
and harvstd so arly and so wll, or got so good a rturn, as did
Nicholas.
H dislikd having anything to do with th domstic srfs—th “drons”
as h calld thm—and vryon said h spoild thm by his laxity. Whn
a dcision had to b takn rgarding a domstic srf, spcially if on
had to b punishd, h always flt undcidd and consultd vrybody in
th hous; but whn it was possibl to hav a domstic srf conscriptd
instad of a land workr h did so without th last hsitation. H
nvr flt any hsitation in daling with th pasants. H knw that his
vry dcision would b approvd by thm all with vry fw xcptions.
H did not allow himslf ithr to b hard on or punish a man, or to
mak things asy for or rward anyon, mrly bcaus h flt inclind
to do so. H could not hav said by what standard h judgd what h
should or should not do, but th standard was quit firm and dfinit in
his own mind.
Oftn, spaking with vxation of som failur or irrgularity, h would
say: “What can on do with our Russian pasants?” and imagind that h
could not bar thm.
Yt h lovd “our Russian pasants” and thir way of lif with his whol
soul, and for that vry rason had undrstood and assimilatd th on
way and mannr of farming which producd good rsults.
Countss Mary was jalous of this passion of hr husband’s and rgrttd
that sh could not shar it; but sh could not undrstand th joys and
vxations h drivd from that world, to hr so rmot and alin. Sh
could not undrstand why h was so particularly animatd and happy
whn, aftr gtting up at daybrak and spnding th whol morning in th
filds or on th thrshing floor, h rturnd from th sowing or mowing
or raping to hav ta with hr. Sh did not undrstand why h spok
with such admiration and dlight of th farming of th thrifty and
wll-to-do pasant Matthw rmíshin, who with his family had cartd
corn all night; or of th fact that his (Nicholas’) shavs wr alrady
stackd bfor anyon ls had his harvst in. Sh did not undrstand
why h stppd out from th window to th vranda and smild undr his
mustach and winkd so joyfully, whn warm stady rain bgan to fall
on th dry and thirsty shoots of th young oats, or why whn th wind
carrid away a thratning cloud during th hay harvst h would rturn
from th barn, flushd, sunburnd, and prspiring, with a smll of
wormwood and gntian in his hair and, glfully rubbing his hands, would
say: “Wll, on mor day and my grain and th pasants’ will all b
undr covr.”
Still lss did sh undrstand why h, kindhartd and always rady to
anticipat hr wishs, should bcom almost dsprat whn sh brought
him a ptition from som pasant mn or womn who had appald to hr
to b xcusd som work; why h, that kind Nicholas, should obstinatly
rfus hr, angrily asking hr not to intrfr in what was not hr
businss. Sh flt h had a world apart, which h lovd passionatly and
which had laws sh had not fathomd.
Somtims whn, trying to undrstand him, sh spok of th good work h
was doing for his srfs, h would b vxd and rply: “Not in th last;
it nvr ntrd my had and I wouldn’t do that for thir good! That’s
all potry and old wivs’ talk—all that doing good to on’s nighbor!
What I want is that our childrn should not hav to go bgging. I must
put our affairs in ordr whil I am aliv, that’s all. And to do that,
ordr and strictnss ar ssntial.... That’s all about it!” said h,
clnching his vigorous fist. “And fairnss, of cours,” h addd, “for
if th pasant is nakd and hungry and has only on misrabl hors, h
can do no good ithr for himslf or for m.”
And all Nicholas did was fruitful—probably just bcaus h rfusd to
allow himslf to think that h was doing good to othrs for virtu’s
sak. His mans incrasd rapidly; srfs from nighboring stats cam
to bg him to buy thm, and long aftr his dath th mmory of his
administration was dvoutly prsrvd among th srfs. “H was a
mastr... th pasants’ affairs first and thn his own. Of cours h was
not to b trifld with ithr—in a word, h was a ral mastr!”
CHAPTR VIII
On mattr connctd with his managmnt somtims worrid Nicholas, and
that was his quick tmpr togthr with his old hussar habit of making
fr us of his fists. At first h saw nothing rprhnsibl in
this, but in th scond yar of his marriag his viw of that form of
punishmnt suddnly changd.
Onc in summr h had snt for th villag ldr from Boguchárovo, a
man who had succdd to th post whn Dron did and who was accusd of
dishonsty and various irrgularitis. Nicholas wnt out into th porch
to qustion him, and immdiatly aftr th ldr had givn a fw rplis
th sound of cris and blows wr hard. On rturning to lunch Nicholas
wnt up to his wif, who sat with hr had bnt low ovr hr mbroidry
fram, and as usual bgan to tll hr what h had bn doing that
morning. Among othr things h spok of th Boguchárovo ldr. Countss
Mary turnd rd and thn pal, but continud to sit with had bowd and
lips comprssd and gav hr husband no rply.
“Such an insolnt scoundrl!” h crid, growing hot again at th mr
rcollction of him. “If h had told m h was drunk and did not s...
But what is th mattr with you, Mary?” h suddnly askd.
Countss Mary raisd hr had and trid to spak, but hastily lookd
down again and hr lips puckrd.
“Why, whatvr is th mattr, my darst?”
Th looks of th plain Countss Mary always improvd whn sh was in
tars. Sh nvr crid from pain or vxation, but always from sorrow or
pity, and whn sh wpt hr radiant ys acquird an irrsistibl charm.
Th momnt Nicholas took hr hand sh could no longr rstrain hrslf
and bgan to cry.
“Nicholas, I saw it... h was to blam, but why do you... Nicholas!” and
sh covrd hr fac with hr hands.
Nicholas said nothing. H flushd crimson, lft hr sid, and pacd up
and down th room. H undrstood what sh was wping about, but could
not in his hart at onc agr with hr that what h had rgardd
from childhood as quit an vryday vnt was wrong. “Is it just
sntimntality, old wivs’ tals, or is sh right?” h askd himslf.
Bfor h had solvd that point h glancd again at hr fac filld with
lov and pain, and h suddnly ralizd that sh was right and that h
had long bn sinning against himslf.
“Mary,” h said softly, going up to hr, “it will nvr happn again;
I giv you my word. Nvr,” h rpatd in a trmbling voic lik a boy
asking for forgivnss.
Th tars flowd fastr still from th countss’ ys. Sh took his hand
and kissd it.
“Nicholas, whn did you brak your camo?” sh askd to chang th
subjct, looking at his fingr on which h wor a ring with a camo of
Laocoön’s had.
“Today—it was th sam affair. Oh, Mary, don’t rmind m of it!” and
again h flushd. “I giv you my word of honor it shan’t occur again,
and lt this always b a rmindr to m,” and h pointd to th brokn
ring.
Aftr that, whn in discussions with his villag ldrs or stwards th
blood rushd to his fac and his fists bgan to clnch, Nicholas would
turn th brokn ring on his fingr and would drop his ys bfor th
man who was making him angry. But h did forgt himslf onc or twic
within a twlvmonth, and thn h would go and confss to his wif, and
would again promis that this should rally b th vry last tim.
“Mary, you must dspis m!” h would say. “I dsrv it.”
“You should go, go away at onc, if you don’t fl strong nough to
control yourslf,” sh would rply sadly, trying to comfort hr husband.
Among th gntry of th provinc Nicholas was rspctd but not likd.
H did not concrn himslf with th intrsts of his own class, and
consquntly som thought him proud and othrs thought him stupid. Th
whol summr, from spring sowing to harvst, h was busy with th work
on his farm. In autumn h gav himslf up to hunting with th sam
businss-lik sriousnss—laving hom for a month, or vn two, with
his hunt. In wintr h visitd his othr villags or spnt his tim
rading. Th books h rad wr chifly historical, and on ths h
spnt a crtain sum vry yar. H was collcting, as h said, a srious
library, and h mad it a rul to rad through all th books h bought.
H would sit in his study with a grav air, rading—a task h first
imposd upon himslf as a duty, but which aftrwards bcam a habit
affording him a spcial kind of plasur and a consciousnss of
bing occupid with srious mattrs. In wintr, xcpt for businss
xcursions, h spnt most of his tim at hom making himslf on with
his family and ntring into all th dtails of his childrn’s rlations
with thir mothr. Th harmony btwn him and his wif grw closr and
closr and h daily discovrd frsh spiritual trasurs in hr.
From th tim of his marriag Sónya had livd in his hous. Bfor
that, Nicholas had told his wif all that had passd btwn himslf and
Sónya, blaming himslf and commnding hr. H had askd Princss Mary to
b gntl and kind to his cousin. Sh thoroughly ralizd th wrong h
had don Sónya, flt hrslf to blam toward hr, and imagind that hr
walth had influncd Nicholas’ choic. Sh could not find fault with
Sónya in any way and trid to b fond of hr, but oftn flt ill-will
toward hr which sh could not ovrcom.
Onc sh had a talk with hr frind Natásha about Sónya and about hr
own injustic toward hr.
“You know,” said Natásha, “you hav rad th Gospls a grat dal—thr
is a passag in thm that just fits Sónya.”
“What?” askd Countss Mary, surprisd.
“‘To him that hath shall b givn, and from him that hath not shall b
takn away.’ You rmmbr? Sh is on that hath not; why, I don’t know.
Prhaps sh lacks gotism, I don’t know, but from hr is takn away, and
vrything has bn takn away. Somtims I am dradfully sorry for hr.
Formrly I vry much wantd Nicholas to marry hr, but I always had
a sort of prsntimnt that it would not com off. Sh is a stril
flowr, you know—lik som strawbrry blossoms. Somtims I am sorry for
hr, and somtims I think sh dosn’t fl it as you or I would.”
Though Countss Mary told Natásha that thos words in th Gospl must b
undrstood diffrntly, yt looking at Sónya sh agrd with Natásha’s
xplanation. It rally smd that Sónya did not fl hr position
trying, and had grown quit rconcild to hr lot as a stril flowr.
Sh smd to b fond not so much of individuals as of th family as a
whol. Lik a cat, sh had attachd hrslf not to th popl but to th
hom. Sh waitd on th old countss, pttd and spoild th childrn,
was always rady to rndr th small srvics for which sh had a gift,
and all this was unconsciously accptd from hr with insufficint
gratitud.
Th country sat at Bald Hills had bn rbuilt, though not on th sam
scal as undr th old princ.
Th buildings, bgun undr straitnd circumstancs, wr mor than
simpl. Th immns hous on th old ston foundations was of wood,
plastrd only insid. It had bar dal floors and was furnishd with
vry simpl hard sofas, armchairs, tabls, and chairs mad by thir own
srf carpntrs out of thir own birchwood. Th hous was spacious
and had rooms for th hous srfs and apartmnts for visitors. Whol
familis of th Rostóvs’ and Bolkónskis’ rlations somtims cam to
Bald Hills with sixtn horss and dozns of srvants and stayd for
months. Bsids that, four tims a yar, on th nam days and birthdays
of th hosts, as many as a hundrd visitors would gathr thr for a day
or two. Th rst of th yar lif pursud its unbrokn routin with its
ordinary occupations, and its brakfasts, lunchs, dinnrs, and supprs,
providd out of th produc of th stat.
CHAPTR IX
It was th v of St. Nicholas, th fifth of Dcmbr, 1820. Natásha had
bn staying at hr brothr’s with hr husband and childrn sinc arly
autumn. Pirr had gon to Ptrsburg on businss of his own for thr
wks as h said, but had rmaind thr narly svn wks and was
xpctd back vry minut.
Bsids th Bzúkhov family, Nicholas’ old frind th rtird Gnral
Vasíli Dmítrich Dnísov was staying with th Rostóvs this fifth of
Dcmbr.
On th sixth, which was his nam day whn th hous would b full of
visitors, Nicholas knw h would hav to xchang his Tartar tunic for
a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointd tos, and driv to
th nw church h had built, and thn rciv visitors who would com to
congratulat him, offr thm rfrshmnts, and talk about th lctions
of th nobility; but h considrd himslf ntitld to spnd th v
of that day in his usual way. H xamind th bailiff’s accounts of
th villag in Ryazán which blongd to his wif’s nphw, wrot two
businss lttrs, and walkd ovr to th granaris, cattl yards and
stabls bfor dinnr. Having takn prcautions against th gnral
drunknnss to b xpctd on th morrow bcaus it was a grat saint’s
day, h rturnd to dinnr, and without having tim for a privat talk
with his wif sat down at th long tabl laid for twnty prsons, at
which th whol houshold had assmbld. At that tabl wr his mothr,
his mothr’s old lady companion Blóva, his wif, thir thr childrn
with thir govrnss and tutor, his wif’s nphw with his tutor, Sónya,
Dnísov, Natásha, hr thr childrn, thir govrnss, and old Michal
Ivánovich, th lat princ’s architct, who was living on in rtirmnt
at Bald Hills.
Countss Mary sat at th othr nd of th tabl. Whn hr husband took
his plac sh concludd, from th rapid mannr in which aftr taking
up his tabl napkin h pushd back th tumblr and winglass standing
bfor him, that h was out of humor, as was somtims th cas whn
h cam in to dinnr straight from th farm—spcially bfor th soup.
Countss Mary wll knw that mood of his, and whn sh hrslf was in
a good fram of mind quitly waitd till h had had his soup and thn
bgan to talk to him and mak him admit that thr was no caus for his
ill-humor. But today sh quit forgot that and was hurt that h should
b angry with hr without any rason, and sh flt unhappy. Sh askd
him whr h had bn. H rplid. Sh again inquird whthr
vrything was going wll on th farm. Hr unnatural ton mad him winc
unplasantly and h rplid hastily.
“Thn I’m not mistakn,” thought Countss Mary. “Why is h cross with
m?” Sh concludd from his ton that h was vxd with hr and wishd
to nd th convrsation. Sh knw hr rmarks soundd unnatural, but
could not rfrain from asking som mor qustions.
Thanks to Dnísov th convrsation at tabl soon bcam gnral and
livly, and sh did not talk to hr husband. Whn thy lft th tabl
and wnt as usual to thank th old countss, Countss Mary hld out hr
hand and kissd hr husband, and askd him why h was angry with hr.
“You always hav such strang fancis! I didn’t vn think of bing
angry,” h rplid.
But th word always smd to hr to imply: “Ys, I am angry but I won’t
tll you why.”
Nicholas and his wif livd togthr so happily that vn Sónya and th
old countss, who flt jalous and would hav likd thm to disagr,
could find nothing to rproach thm with; but vn thy had thir
momnts of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just aftr thy
had bn happist togthr, thy suddnly had a fling of strangmnt
and hostility, which occurrd most frquntly during Countss Mary’s
prgnancis, and this was such a tim.
“Wll, mssiurs t msdams,” said Nicholas loudly and with apparnt
chrfulnss (it smd to Countss Mary that h did it on purpos to
vx hr), “I hav bn on my ft sinc six this morning. Tomorrow I
shall hav to suffr, so today I’ll go and rst.”
And without a word to his wif h wnt to th littl sitting room and
lay down on th sofa.
“That’s always th way,” thought Countss Mary. “H talks to vryon
xcpt m. I s... I s that I am rpulsiv to him, spcially whn I
am in this condition.” Sh lookd down at hr xpandd figur and in th
glass at hr pal, sallow, maciatd fac in which hr ys now lookd
largr than vr.
And vrything annoyd hr—Dnísov’s shouting and laughtr, Natásha’s
talk, and spcially a quick glanc Sónya gav hr.
Sónya was always th first xcus Countss Mary found for fling
irritatd.
Having sat awhil with hr visitors without undrstanding anything of
what thy wr saying, sh softly lft th room and wnt to th nursry.
Th childrn wr playing at “going to Moscow” in a carriag mad of
chairs and invitd hr to go with thm. Sh sat down and playd with
thm a littl, but th thought of hr husband and his unrasonabl
crossnss worrid hr. Sh got up and, walking on tipto with
difficulty, wnt to th small sitting room.
“Prhaps h is not aslp; I’ll hav an xplanation with him,” sh
said to hrslf. Littl Andrw, hr ldst boy, imitating his mothr,
followd hr on tipto. Sh did not notic him.
“Mary, dar, I think h is aslp—h was so tird,” said Sónya, mting
hr in th larg sitting room (it smd to Countss Mary that sh
crossd hr path vrywhr). “Andrw may wak him.”
Countss Mary lookd round, saw littl Andrw following hr, flt that
Sónya was right, and for that vry rason flushd and with vidnt
difficulty rfraind from saying somthing harsh. Sh mad no rply, but
to avoid obying Sónya bckond to Andrw to follow hr quitly and wnt
to th door. Sónya wnt away by anothr door. From th room in which
Nicholas was slping cam th sound of his vn brathing, vry
slightst ton of which was familiar to his wif. As sh listnd to it
sh saw bfor hr his smooth handsom forhad, his mustach, and his
whol fac, as sh had so oftn sn it in th stillnss of th night
whn h slpt. Nicholas suddnly movd and clard his throat. And at
that momnt littl Andrw shoutd from outsid th door: “Papa! Mamma’s
standing hr!” Countss Mary turnd pal with fright and mad signs
to th boy. H grw silnt, and quit nsud for a momnt, trribl to
Countss Mary. Sh knw how Nicholas dislikd bing wakd. Thn through
th door sh hard Nicholas claring his throat again and stirring, and
his voic said crossly:
“I can’t gt a momnt’s pac.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring
him hr?”
“I only cam in to look and did not notic... forgiv m....”
Nicholas coughd and said no mor. Countss Mary movd away from th
door and took th boy back to th nursry. Fiv minuts latr littl
black-yd thr-yar-old Natásha, hr fathr’s pt, having larnd from
hr brothr that Papa was aslp and Mamma was in th sitting room, ran
to hr fathr unobsrvd by hr mothr. Th dark-yd littl girl boldly
opnd th craking door, wnt up to th sofa with nrgtic stps of
hr sturdy littl lgs, and having xamind th position of hr fathr,
who was aslp with his back to hr, ros on tipto and kissd th hand
which lay undr his had. Nicholas turnd with a tndr smil on his
fac.
“Natásha, Natásha!” cam Countss Mary’s frightnd whispr from th
door. “Papa wants to slp.”
“No, Mamma, h dosn’t want to slp,” said littl Natásha with
conviction. “H’s laughing.”
Nicholas lowrd his lgs, ros, and took his daughtr in his arms.
“Com in, Mary,” h said to his wif.
Sh wnt in and sat down by hr husband.
“I did not notic him following m,” sh said timidly. “I just lookd
in.”
Holding his littl girl with on arm, Nicholas glancd at his wif and,
sing hr guilty xprssion, put his othr arm around hr and kissd
hr hair.
“May I kiss Mamma?” h askd Natásha.
Natásha smild bashfully.
“Again!” sh commandd, pointing with a prmptory gstur to th spot
whr Nicholas had placd th kiss.
“I don’t know why you think I am cross,” said Nicholas, rplying to th
qustion h knw was in his wif’s mind.
“You hav no ida how unhappy, how lonly, I fl whn you ar lik
that. It always sms to m...”
“Mary, don’t talk nonsns. You ought to b ashamd of yourslf!” h
said gaily.
“It sms to b that you can’t lov m, that I am so plain... always...
and now... in this cond...”
“Oh, how absurd you ar! It is not bauty that ndars, it’s lov that
maks us s bauty. It is only Malvínas and womn of that kind who ar
lovd for thir bauty. But do I lov my wif? I don’t lov hr, but...
I don’t know how to put it. Without you, or whn somthing coms btwn
us lik this, I sm lost and can’t do anything. Now do I lov my
fingr? I don’t lov it, but just try to cut it off!”
“I’m not lik that myslf, but I undrstand. So you’r not angry with
m?”
“Awfully angry!” h said, smiling and gtting up. And smoothing his hair
h bgan to pac th room.
“Do you know, Mary, what I’v bn thinking?” h bgan, immdiatly
thinking aloud in his wif’s prsnc now that thy had mad it up.
H did not ask if sh was rady to listn to him. H did not car. A
thought had occurrd to him and so it blongd to hr also. And h told
hr of his intntion to prsuad Pirr to stay with thm till spring.
Countss Mary listnd till h had finishd, mad som rmark, and in
hr turn bgan thinking aloud. Hr thoughts wr about th childrn.
“You can s th woman in hr alrady,” sh said in Frnch, pointing to
littl Natásha. “You rproach us womn with bing illogical. Hr is our
logic. I say: ‘Papa wants to slp!’ but sh says, ‘No, h’s laughing.’
And sh was right,” said Countss Mary with a happy smil.
“Ys, ys.” And Nicholas, taking his littl daughtr in his strong hand,
liftd hr high, placd hr on his shouldr, hld hr by th lgs, and
pacd th room with hr. Thr was an xprssion of carfr happinss
on th facs of both fathr and daughtr.
“But you know you may b unfair. You ar too fond of this on,” his wif
whisprd in Frnch.
“Ys, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...”
At that momnt thy hard th sound of th door pully and footstps in
th hall and antroom, as if somon had arrivd.
“Sombody has com.”
“I am sur it is Pirr. I will go and s,” said Countss Mary and lft
th room.
In hr absnc Nicholas allowd himslf to giv his littl daughtr a
gallop round th room. Out of brath, h took th laughing child quickly
from his shouldr and prssd hr to his hart. His caprs rmindd
him of dancing, and looking at th child’s round happy littl fac h
thought of what sh would b lik whn h was an old man, taking hr
into socity and dancing th mazurka with hr as his old fathr had
dancd Danil Coopr with his daughtr.
“It is h, it is h, Nicholas!” said Countss Mary, r-ntring th room
a fw minuts latr. “Now our Natásha has com to lif. You should hav
sn hr cstasy, and how h caught it for having stayd away so long.
Wll, com along now, quick, quick! It’s tim you two wr partd,” sh
addd, looking smilingly at th littl girl who clung to hr fathr.
Nicholas wnt out holding th child by th hand.
Countss Mary rmaind in th sitting room.
“I should nvr, nvr hav blivd that on could b so happy,” sh
whisprd to hrslf. A smil lit up hr fac but at th sam tim sh
sighd, and hr dp ys xprssd a quit sadnss as though sh
flt, through hr happinss, that thr is anothr sort of happinss
unattainabl in this lif and of which sh involuntarily thought at that
instant.
CHAPTR X
Natásha had marrid in th arly spring of 1813, and in 1820 alrady had
thr daughtrs bsids a son for whom sh had longd and whom sh was
now nursing. Sh had grown stoutr and broadr, so that it was difficult
to rcogniz in this robust, mothrly woman th slim, livly Natásha of
formr days. Hr faturs wr mor dfind and had a calm, soft,
and srn xprssion. In hr fac thr was non of th vr-glowing
animation that had formrly burnd thr and constitutd its charm.
Now hr fac and body wr oftn all that on saw, and hr soul was
not visibl at all. All that struck th y was a strong, handsom, and
frtil woman. Th old fir vry rarly kindld in hr fac now. That
happnd only whn, as was th cas that day, hr husband rturnd hom,
or a sick child was convalscnt, or whn sh and Countss Mary spok of
Princ Andrw (sh nvr mntiond him to hr husband, who sh imagind
was jalous of Princ Andrw’s mmory), or on th rar occasions whn
somthing happnd to induc hr to sing, a practic sh had quit
abandond sinc hr marriag. At th rar momnts whn th old fir
did kindl in hr handsom, fully dvlopd body sh was vn mor
attractiv than in formr days.
Sinc thir marriag Natásha and hr husband had livd in Moscow, in
Ptrsburg, on thir stat nar Moscow, or with hr mothr, that is to
say, in Nicholas’ hous. Th young Countss Bzúkhova was not oftn sn
in socity, and thos who mt hr thr wr not plasd with hr
and found hr nithr attractiv nor amiabl. Not that Natásha likd
solitud—sh did not know whthr sh likd it or not, sh vn thought
that sh did not—but with hr prgnancis, hr confinmnts, th nursing
of hr childrn, and sharing vry momnt of hr husband’s lif, sh had
dmands on hr tim which could b satisfid only by rnouncing socity.
All who had known Natásha bfor hr marriag wondrd at th chang
in hr as at somthing xtraordinary. Only th old countss with hr
matrnal instinct had ralizd that all Natásha’s outbursts had bn du
to hr nd of childrn and a husband—as sh hrslf had onc xclaimd
at Otrádno not so much in fun as in arnst—and hr mothr was now
surprisd at th surpris xprssd by thos who had nvr undrstood
Natásha, and sh kpt saying that sh had always known that Natásha
would mak an xmplary wif and mothr.
“Only sh lts hr lov of hr husband and childrn ovrflow all
bounds,” said th countss, “so that it vn bcoms absurd.”
Natásha did not follow th goldn rul advocatd by clvr folk,
spcially by th Frnch, which says that a girl should not lt hrslf
go whn sh marris, should not nglct hr accomplishmnts, should b
vn mor carful of hr apparanc than whn sh was unmarrid, and
should fascinat hr husband as much as sh did bfor h bcam hr
husband. Natásha on th contrary had at onc abandond all hr witchry,
of which hr singing had bn an unusually powrful part. Sh gav it up
just bcaus it was so powrfully sductiv. Sh took no pains with
hr mannrs or with dlicacy of spch, or with hr toilt, or to show
hrslf to hr husband in hr most bcoming attituds, or to avoid
inconvnincing him by bing too xacting. Sh actd in contradiction
to all thos ruls. Sh flt that th allurmnts instinct had formrly
taught hr to us would now b mrly ridiculous in th ys of
hr husband, to whom sh had from th first momnt givn hrslf up
ntirly—that is, with hr whol soul, laving no cornr of it hiddn
from him. Sh flt that hr unity with hr husband was not maintaind
by th potic flings that had attractd him to hr, but by somthing
ls—indfinit but firm as th bond btwn hr own body and soul.
To fluff out hr curls, put on fashionabl drsss, and sing romantic
songs to fascinat hr husband would hav smd as strang as to adorn
hrslf to attract hrslf. To adorn hrslf for othrs might prhaps
hav bn agrabl—sh did not know—but sh had no tim at all for it.
Th chif rason for dvoting no tim ithr to singing, to drss, or
to choosing hr words was that sh rally had no tim to spar for ths
things.
W know that man has th faculty of bcoming compltly absorbd in
a subjct howvr trivial it may b, and that thr is no subjct so
trivial that it will not grow to infinit proportions if on’s ntir
attntion is dvotd to it.
Th subjct which wholly ngrossd Natásha’s attntion was hr family:
that is, hr husband whom sh had to kp so that h should blong
ntirly to hr and to th hom, and th childrn whom sh had to bar,
bring into th world, nurs, and bring up.
And th dpr sh pntratd, not with hr mind only but with hr whol
soul, hr whol bing, into th subjct that absorbd hr, th largr
did that subjct grow and th wakr and mor inadquat did hr powrs
appar, so that sh concntratd thm wholly on that on thing and yt
was unabl to accomplish all that sh considrd ncssary.
Thr wr thn as now convrsations and discussions about womn’s
rights, th rlations of husband and wif and thir frdom and rights,
though ths thms wr not yt trmd qustions as thy ar now; but
ths topics wr not mrly unintrsting to Natásha, sh positivly
did not undrstand thm.
Ths qustions, thn as now, xistd only for thos who s nothing in
marriag but th plasur marrid popl gt from on anothr, that is,
only th bginnings of marriag and not its whol significanc, which
lis in th family.
Discussions and qustions of that kind, which ar lik th qustion of
how to gt th gratst gratification from on’s dinnr, did not thn
and do not now xist for thos for whom th purpos of a dinnr is th
nourishmnt it affords; and th purpos of marriag is th family.
If th purpos of dinnr is to nourish th body, a man who ats two
dinnrs at onc may prhaps gt mor njoymnt but will not attain his
purpos, for his stomach will not digst th two dinnrs.
If th purpos of marriag is th family, th prson who wishs to hav
many wivs or husbands may prhaps obtain much plasur, but in that
cas will not hav a family.
If th purpos of food is nourishmnt and th purpos of marriag is th
family, th whol qustion rsolvs itslf into not ating mor than on
can digst, and not having mor wivs or husbands than ar ndd for
th family—that is, on wif or on husband. Natásha ndd a husband. A
husband was givn hr and h gav hr a family. And sh not only saw no
nd of any othr or bttr husband, but as all th powrs of hr soul
wr intnt on srving that husband and family, sh could not imagin
and saw no intrst in imagining how it would b if things wr
diffrnt.
Natásha did not car for socity in gnral, but prizd th mor th
socity of hr rlativs—Countss Mary, and hr brothr, hr mothr, and
Sónya. Sh valud th company of thos to whom sh could com striding
dishvld from th nursry in hr drssing gown, and with joyful fac
show a yllow instad of a grn stain on baby’s napkin, and from whom
sh could har rassuring words to th ffct that baby was much bttr.
To such an xtnt had Natásha lt hrslf go that th way sh drssd
and did hr hair, hr ill-chosn words, and hr jalousy—sh was jalous
of Sónya, of th govrnss, and of vry woman, prtty or plain—wr
habitual subjcts of jst to thos about hr. Th gnral opinion was
that Pirr was undr his wif’s thumb, which was rally tru. From th
vry first days of thir marrid lif Natásha had announcd hr dmands.
Pirr was gratly surprisd by his wif’s viw, to him a prfctly
novl on, that vry momnt of his lif blongd to hr and to th
family. His wif’s dmands astonishd him, but thy also flattrd him,
and h submittd to thm.
Pirr’s subjction consistd in th fact that h not only dard not
flirt with, but dard not vn spak smilingly to, any othr woman; did
not dar din at th Club as a pastim, did not dar spnd mony on a
whim, and did not dar absnt himslf for any lngth of tim, xcpt on
businss—in which his wif includd his intllctual pursuits, which
sh did not in th last undrstand but to which sh attributd grat
importanc. To mak up for this, at hom Pirr had th right to
rgulat his lif and that of th whol family xactly as h chos. At
hom Natásha placd hrslf in th position of a slav to hr husband,
and th whol houshold wnt on tipto whn h was occupid—that is, was
rading or writing in his study. Pirr had but to show a partiality for
anything to gt just what h likd don always. H had only to xprss a
wish and Natásha would jump up and run to fulfill it.
Th ntir houshold was govrnd according to Pirr’s supposd ordrs,
that is, by his wishs which Natásha trid to guss. Thir way of
lif and plac of rsidnc, thir acquaintancs and tis, Natásha’s
occupations, th childrn’s upbringing, wr all slctd not mrly
with rgard to Pirr’s xprssd wishs, but to what Natásha from th
thoughts h xprssd in convrsation supposd his wishs to b. And sh
dducd th ssntials of his wishs quit corrctly, and having onc
arrivd at thm clung to thm tnaciously. Whn Pirr himslf wantd to
chang his mind sh would fight him with his own wapons.
Thus in a tim of troubl vr mmorabl to him aftr th birth of thir
first child who was dlicat, whn thy had to chang th wt nurs
thr tims and Natásha fll ill from dspair, Pirr on day told hr
of Roussau’s viw, with which h quit agrd, that to hav a wt
nurs is unnatural and harmful. Whn hr nxt baby was born, dspit
th opposition of hr mothr, th doctors, and vn of hr husband
himslf—who wr all vigorously opposd to hr nursing hr baby hrslf,
a thing thn unhard of and considrd injurious—sh insistd on having
hr own way, and aftr that nursd all hr babis hrslf.
It vry oftn happnd that in a momnt of irritation husband and wif
would hav a disput, but long aftrwards Pirr to his surpris and
dlight would find in his wif’s idas and actions th vry thought
against which sh had argud, but divstd of vrything suprfluous
that in th xcitmnt of th disput h had addd whn xprssing his
opinion.
Aftr svn yars of marriag Pirr had th joyous and firm
consciousnss that h was not a bad man, and h flt this bcaus h saw
himslf rflctd in his wif. H flt th good and bad within himslf
inxtricably mingld and ovrlapping. But only what was rally good in
him was rflctd in his wif, all that was not quit good was rjctd.
And this was not th rsult of logical rasoning but was a dirct and
mystrious rflction.
CHAPTR XI
Two months prviously whn Pirr was alrady staying with th Rostóvs
h had rcivd a lttr from Princ Thodor, asking him to com
to Ptrsburg to confr on som important qustions that wr bing
discussd thr by a socity of which Pirr was on of th principal
foundrs.
On rading that lttr (sh always rad hr husband’s lttrs) Natásha
hrslf suggstd that h should go to Ptrsburg, though sh would fl
his absnc vry acutly. Sh attributd immns importanc to all
hr husband’s intllctual and abstract intrsts though sh did not
undrstand thm, and sh always dradd bing a hindranc to him in such
mattrs. To Pirr’s timid look of inquiry aftr rading th lttr sh
rplid by asking him to go, but to fix a dfinit dat for his rturn.
H was givn four wks’ lav of absnc.
vr sinc that lav of absnc had xpird, mor than a fortnight
bfor, Natásha had bn in a constant stat of alarm, dprssion, and
irritability.
Dnísov, now a gnral on th rtird list and much dissatisfid with
th prsnt stat of affairs, had arrivd during that fortnight. H
lookd at Natásha with sorrow and surpris as at a bad liknss of a
prson onc dar. A dull, djctd look, random rplis, and talk about
th nursry was all h saw and hard from his formr nchantrss.
Natásha was sad and irritabl all that tim, spcially whn hr mothr,
hr brothr, Sónya, or Countss Mary in thir fforts to consol hr
trid to xcus Pirr and suggstd rasons for his dlay in rturning.
“It’s all nonsns, all rubbish—thos discussions which lad to nothing
and all thos idiotic socitis!” Natásha dclard of th vry affairs
in th immns importanc of which sh firmly blivd.
And sh would go to th nursry to nurs Ptya, hr only boy. No on
ls could tll hr anything so comforting or so rasonabl as this
littl thr-month-old cratur whn h lay at hr brast and sh was
conscious of th movmnt of his lips and th snuffling of his littl
nos. That cratur said: “You ar angry, you ar jalous, you would
lik to pay him out, you ar afraid—but hr am I! And I am h...” and
that was unanswrabl. It was mor than tru.
During that fortnight of anxity Natásha rsortd to th baby for
comfort so oftn, and fussd ovr him so much, that sh ovrfd him and
h fll ill. Sh was trrifid by his illnss, and yt that was just
what sh ndd. Whil attnding to him sh bor th anxity about hr
husband mor asily.
Sh was nursing hr boy whn th sound of Pirr’s sligh was hard
at th front door, and th old nurs—knowing how to plas hr
mistrss—ntrd th room inaudibly but hurridly and with a baming
fac.
“Has h com?” Natásha askd quickly in a whispr, afraid to mov lst
sh should rous th dozing baby.
“H’s com, ma’am,” whisprd th nurs.
Th blood rushd to Natásha’s fac and hr ft involuntarily movd, but
sh could not jump up and run out. Th baby again opnd his ys and
lookd at hr. “You’r hr?” h smd to b saying, and again lazily
smackd his lips.
Cautiously withdrawing hr brast, Natásha rockd him a littl, handd
him to th nurs, and wnt with rapid stps toward th door. But at th
door sh stoppd as if hr conscinc rproachd hr for having in
hr joy lft th child too soon, and sh glancd round. Th nurs with
raisd lbows was lifting th infant ovr th rail of his cot.
“Go, ma’am! Don’t worry, go!” sh whisprd, smiling, with th kind of
familiarity that grows up btwn a nurs and hr mistrss.
Natásha ran with light footstps to th antroom.
Dnísov, who had com out of th study into th dancing room with his
pip, now for th first tim rcognizd th old Natásha. A flood of
brilliant, joyful light pourd from hr transfigurd fac.
“H’s com!” sh xclaimd as sh ran past, and Dnísov flt that h too
was dlightd that Pirr, whom h did not much car for, had rturnd.
On raching th vstibul Natásha saw a tall figur in a fur coat
unwinding his scarf. “It’s h! It’s rally h! H has com!” sh said
to hrslf, and rushing at him mbracd him, prssd his had to hr
brast, and thn pushd him back and gazd at his ruddy, happy fac,
covrd with hoarfrost. “Ys, it is h, happy and contntd....”
Thn all at onc sh rmmbrd th torturs of suspns sh had
xprincd for th last fortnight, and th joy that had lit up hr
fac vanishd; sh frownd and ovrwhlmd Pirr with a torrnt of
rproachs and angry words.
“Ys, it’s all vry wll for you. You ar plasd, you’v had a good
tim.... But what about m? You might at last hav shown considration
for th childrn. I am nursing and my milk was spoild.... Ptya was at
dath’s door. But you wr njoying yourslf. Ys, njoying...”
Pirr knw h was not to blam, for h could not hav com soonr; h
knw this outburst was unsmly and would blow ovr in a minut or two;
abov all h knw that h himslf was bright and happy. H wantd
to smil but dard not vn think of doing so. H mad a pitous,
frightnd fac and bnt down.
“I could not, on my honor. But how is Ptya?”
“All right now. Com along! I wondr you’r not ashamd! If only you
could s what I was lik without you, how I suffrd!”
“You ar wll?”
“Com, com!” sh said, not ltting go of his arm. And thy wnt to
thir rooms.
Whn Nicholas and his wif cam to look for Pirr h was in th nursry
holding his baby son, who was again awak, on his hug right palm and
dandling him. A blissful bright smil was fixd on th baby’s broad fac
with its toothlss opn mouth. Th storm was long sinc ovr and thr
was bright, joyous sunshin on Natásha’s fac as sh gazd tndrly at
hr husband and child.
“And hav you talkd vrything wll ovr with Princ Thodor?” sh
askd.
“Ys, capitally.”
“You s, h holds it up.” (Sh mant th baby’s had.) “But how h did
frightn m... You’v sn th princss? Is it tru sh’s in lov with
that...”
“Ys, just fancy...”
At that momnt Nicholas and Countss Mary cam in. Pirr with th baby
on his hand stoopd, kissd thm, and rplid to thir inquiris. But
in spit of much that was intrsting and had to b discussd, th baby
with th littl cap on its unstady had vidntly absorbd all his
attntion.
“How swt!” said Countss Mary, looking at and playing with th baby.
“Now, Nicholas,” sh addd, turning to hr husband, “I can’t undrstand
how it is you don’t s th charm of ths dlicious marvls.”
“I don’t and can’t,” rplid Nicholas, looking coldly at th baby. “A
lump of flsh. Com along, Pirr!”
“And yt h’s such an affctionat fathr,” said Countss Mary,
vindicating hr husband, “but only aftr thy ar a yar old or so...”
“Now, Pirr nurss thm splndidly,” said Natásha. “H says his hand is
just mad for a baby’s sat. Just look!”
“Only not for this...” Pirr suddnly xclaimd with a laugh, and
shifting th baby h gav him to th nurs.
CHAPTR XII
As in vry larg houshold, thr wr at Bald Hills svral prfctly
distinct worlds which mrgd into on harmonious whol, though ach
rtaind its own pculiaritis and mad concssions to th othrs. vry
vnt, joyful or sad, that took plac in that hous was important to all
ths worlds, but ach had its own spcial rasons to rjoic or griv
ovr that occurrnc indpndntly of th othrs.
For instanc, Pirr’s rturn was a joyful and important vnt and thy
all flt it to b so.
Th srvants—th most rliabl judgs of thir mastrs bcaus thy
judg not by thir convrsation or xprssions of fling but by thir
acts and way of lif—wr glad of Pirr’s rturn bcaus thy knw that
whn h was thr Count Nicholas would cas going vry day to attnd
to th stat, and would b in bttr spirits and tmpr, and also
bcaus thy would all rciv handsom prsnts for th holidays.
Th childrn and thir govrnsss wr glad of Pirr’s rturn bcaus
no on ls drw thm into th social lif of th houshold as h did.
H alon could play on th clavichord that cossais (his only pic)
to which, as h said, all possibl dancs could b dancd, and thy flt
sur h had brought prsnts for thm all.
Young Nicholas, now a slim lad of fiftn, dlicat and intllignt,
with curly light-brown hair and bautiful ys, was dlightd bcaus
Uncl Pirr as h calld him was th objct of his rapturous and
passionat affction. No on had instilld into him this lov for Pirr
whom h saw only occasionally. Countss Mary who had brought him up
had don hr utmost to mak him lov hr husband as sh lovd him, and
littl Nicholas did lov his uncl, but lovd him with just a shad of
contmpt. Pirr, howvr, h adord. H did not want to b an hussar or
a Knight of St. Gorg lik his uncl Nicholas; h wantd to b larnd,
wis, and kind lik Pirr. In Pirr’s prsnc his fac always shon
with plasur and h flushd and was brathlss whn Pirr spok to
him. H did not miss a singl word h uttrd, and would aftrwards,
with Dssalls or by himslf, rcall and rconsidr th maning of
vrything Pirr had said. Pirr’s past lif and his unhappinss prior
to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formd a vagu potic pictur from
som words h had ovrhard), his advnturs in Moscow, his captivity,
Platón Karatáv (of whom h had hard from Pirr), his lov for Natásha
(of whom th lad was also particularly fond), and spcially Pirr’s
frindship with th fathr whom Nicholas could not rmmbr—all this
mad Pirr in his ys a hro and a saint.
From brokn rmarks about Natásha and his fathr, from th motion with
which Pirr spok of that dad fathr, and from th carful, rvrnt
tndrnss with which Natásha spok of him, th boy, who was only just
bginning to guss what lov is, drivd th notion that his fathr had
lovd Natásha and whn dying had lft hr to his frind. But th fathr
whom th boy did not rmmbr appard to him a divinity who could not
b picturd, and of whom h nvr thought without a swlling hart and
tars of sadnss and raptur. So th boy also was happy that Pirr had
arrivd.
Th gusts wlcomd Pirr bcaus h always hlpd to nlivn and unit
any company h was in.
Th grown-up mmbrs of th family, not to mntion his wif, wr
plasd to hav back a frind whos prsnc mad lif run mor smoothly
and pacfully.
Th old ladis wr plasd with th prsnts h brought thm, and
spcially that Natásha would now b hrslf again.
Pirr flt th diffrnt outlooks of ths various worlds and mad
hast to satisfy all thir xpctations.
Though th most absnt-mindd and forgtful of mn, Pirr, with th aid
of a list his wif drw up, had now bought vrything, not forgtting
his mothr—and brothr-in-law’s commissions, nor th drss matrial for
a prsnt to Blóva, nor toys for his wif’s nphws. In th arly days
of his marriag it had smd strang to him that his wif should xpct
him not to forgt to procur all th things h undrtook to buy, and h
had bn takn aback by hr srious annoyanc whn on his first trip h
forgot vrything. But in tim h grw usd to this dmand. Knowing that
Natásha askd nothing for hrslf, and gav him commissions for othrs
only whn h himslf had offrd to undrtak thm, h now found an
unxpctd and childlik plasur in this purchas of prsnts for
vryon in th hous, and nvr forgot anything. If h now incurrd
Natásha’s cnsur it was only for buying too many and too xpnsiv
things. To hr othr dfcts (as most popl thought thm, but which
to Pirr wr qualitis) of untidinss and nglct of hrslf, sh now
addd stinginss.
From th tim that Pirr bgan lif as a family man on a footing
ntailing havy xpnditur, h had noticd to his surpris that h
spnt only half as much as bfor, and that his affairs—which had bn
in disordr of lat, chifly bcaus of his first wif’s dbts—had bgun
to improv.
Lif was chapr bcaus it was circumscribd: that most xpnsiv
luxury, th kind of lif that can b changd at any momnt, was no
longr his nor did h wish for it. H flt that his way of lif had now
bn sttld onc for all till dath and that to chang it was not in
his powr, and so that way of lif provd conomical.
With a mrry, smiling fac Pirr was sorting his purchass.
“What do you think of this?” said h, unrolling a pic of stuff lik a
shopman.
Natásha, who was sitting opposit to him with hr ldst daughtr on hr
lap, turnd hr sparkling ys swiftly from hr husband to th things h
showd hr.
“That’s for Blóva? xcllnt!” Sh flt th quality of th matrial.
“It was a rubl an arshin, I suppos?”
Pirr told hr th pric.
“Too dar!” Natásha rmarkd. “How plasd th childrn will b and
Mamma too! Only you nd not hav bought m this,” sh addd, unabl to
supprss a smil as sh gazd admiringly at a gold comb st with parls,
of a kind thn just coming into fashion.
“Adèl tmptd m: sh kpt on tlling m to buy it,” rturnd Pirr.
“Whn am I to war it?” and Natásha stuck it in hr coil of hair. “Whn
I tak littl Másha into socity? Prhaps thy will b fashionabl again
by thn. Wll, lt’s go now.”
And collcting th prsnts thy wnt first to th nursry and thn to
th old countss’ rooms.
Th countss was sitting with hr companion Blóva, playing
grand-patinc as usual, whn Pirr and Natásha cam into th drawing
room with parcls undr thir arms.
Th countss was now ovr sixty, was quit gray, and wor a cap with a
frill that surroundd hr fac. Hr fac had shrivld, hr uppr lip
had sunk in, and hr ys wr dim.
Aftr th daths of hr son and husband in such rapid succssion, sh
flt hrslf a bing accidntally forgottn in this world and lft
without aim or objct for hr xistnc. Sh at, drank, slpt, or kpt
awak, but did not liv. Lif gav hr no nw imprssions. Sh wantd
nothing from lif but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only dath
could giv hr. But until dath cam sh had to go on living, that is,
to us hr vital forcs. A pculiarity on ss in vry young childrn
and vry old popl was particularly vidnt in hr. Hr lif had
no xtrnal aims—only a nd to xrcis hr various functions and
inclinations was apparnt. Sh had to at, slp, think, spak, wp,
work, giv vnt to hr angr, and so on, mrly bcaus sh had a
stomach, a brain, muscls, nrvs, and a livr. Sh did ths things not
undr any xtrnal impuls as popl in th full vigor of lif do,
whn bhind th purpos for which thy striv that of xrcising thir
functions rmains unnoticd. Sh talkd only bcaus sh physically
ndd to xrcis hr tongu and lungs. Sh crid as a child dos,
bcaus hr nos had to b clard, and so on. What for popl in thir
full vigor is an aim was for hr vidntly mrly a prtxt.
Thus in th morning—spcially if sh had atn anything rich th day
bfor—sh flt a nd of bing angry and would choos as th handist
prtxt Blóva’s dafnss.
Sh would bgin to say somthing to hr in a low ton from th othr nd
of th room.
“It sms a littl warmr today, my dar,” sh would murmur.
And whn Blóva rplid: “Oh ys, thy’v com,” sh would muttr
angrily: “O Lord! How stupid and daf sh is!”
Anothr prtxt would b hr snuff, which would sm too dry or too damp
or not rubbd fin nough. Aftr ths fits of irritability hr fac
would grow yllow, and hr maids knw by infallibl symptoms whn Blóva
would again b daf, th snuff damp, and th countss’ fac yllow. Just
as sh ndd to work off hr spln so sh had somtims to xrcis
hr still-xisting faculty of thinking—and th prtxt for that was a
gam of patinc. Whn sh ndd to cry, th dcasd count would b
th prtxt. Whn sh wantd to b agitatd, Nicholas and his halth
would b th prtxt, and whn sh flt a nd to spak spitfully, th
prtxt would b Countss Mary. Whn hr vocal organs ndd xrcis,
which was usually toward svn o’clock whn sh had had an aftr-dinnr
rst in a darknd room, th prtxt would b th rtlling of th sam
storis ovr and ovr again to th sam audinc.
Th old lady’s condition was undrstood by th whol houshold though no
on vr spok of it, and thy all mad vry possibl ffort to satisfy
hr nds. Only by a rar glanc xchangd with a sad smil
btwn Nicholas, Pirr, Natásha, and Countss Mary was th common
undrstanding of hr condition xprssd.
But thos glancs xprssd somthing mor: thy said that sh had
playd hr part in lif, that what thy now saw was not hr whol slf,
that w must all bcom lik hr, and that thy wr glad to yild to
hr, to rstrain thmslvs for this onc prcious bing formrly as
full of lif as thmslvs, but now so much to b pitid. “Mmnto
mori,” said ths glancs.
Only th rally hartlss, th stupid ons of that houshold, and th
littl childrn faild to undrstand this and avoidd hr.
CHAPTR XIII
Whn Pirr and his wif ntrd th drawing room th countss was in
on of hr customary stats in which sh ndd th mntal xrtion of
playing patinc, and so—though by forc of habit sh grtd him with
th words sh always usd whn Pirr or hr son rturnd aftr an
absnc: “High tim, my dar, high tim! W wr all wary of waiting
for you. Wll, thank God!” and rcivd hr prsnts with anothr
customary rmark: “It’s not th gift that’s prcious, my dar, but that
you giv it to m, an old woman...”—yt it was vidnt that sh was
not plasd by Pirr’s arrival at that momnt whn it divrtd hr
attntion from th unfinishd gam.
Sh finishd hr gam of patinc and only thn xamind th prsnts.
Thy consistd of a box for cards, of splndid workmanship, a
bright-blu Sèvrs ta cup with shphrdsss dpictd on it and with
a lid, and a gold snuffbox with th count’s portrait on th lid which
Pirr had had don by a miniaturist in Ptrsburg. Th countss had
long wishd for such a box, but as sh did not want to cry just thn sh
glancd indiffrntly at th portrait and gav hr attntion chifly to
th box for cards.
“Thank you, my dar, you hav chrd m up,” said sh as sh always
did. “But bst of all you hav brought yourslf back—for I nvr saw
anything lik it, you ought to giv your wif a scolding! What ar w
to do with hr? Sh is lik a mad woman whn you ar away. Dosn’t s
anything, dosn’t rmmbr anything,” sh wnt on, rpating hr usual
phrass. “Look, Anna Timofvna,” sh addd to hr companion, “s what
a box for cards my son has brought us!”
Blóva admird th prsnts and was dlightd with hr drss matrial.
Though Pirr, Natásha, Nicholas, Countss Mary, and Dnísov had much to
talk about that thy could not discuss bfor th old countss—not
that anything was hiddn from hr, but bcaus sh had droppd so
far bhindhand in many things that had thy bgun to convrs in hr
prsnc thy would hav had to answr inopportun qustions and to
rpat what thy had alrady told hr many tims: that so-and-so was
dad and so-and-so was marrid, which sh would again b unabl to
rmmbr—yt thy sat at ta round th samovar in th drawing room from
habit, and Pirr answrd th countss’ qustions as to whthr Princ
Vasíli had agd and whthr Countss Mary Alxvna had snt grtings
and still thought of thm, and othr mattrs that intrstd no on and
to which sh hrslf was indiffrnt.
Convrsation of this kind, intrsting to no on yt unavoidabl,
continud all through tatim. All th grown-up mmbrs of th family
wr assmbld nar th round ta tabl at which Sónya prsidd bsid
th samovar. Th childrn with thir tutors and govrnsss had had
ta and thir voics wr audibl from th nxt room. At ta all sat
in thir accustomd placs: Nicholas bsid th stov at a small tabl
whr his ta was handd to him; Mílka, th old gray borzoi bitch
(daughtr of th first Mílka), with a quit gray fac and larg black
ys that smd mor prominnt than vr, lay on th armchair bsid
him; Dnísov, whos curly hair, mustach, and whiskrs had turnd half
gray, sat bsid countss Mary with his gnral’s tunic unbuttond;
Pirr sat btwn his wif and th old countss. H spok of what h
knw might intrst th old lady and that sh could undrstand. H
told hr of xtrnal social vnts and of th popl who had formd
th circl of hr contmporaris and had onc bn a ral, living, and
distinct group, but who wr now for th most part scattrd about th
world and lik hrslf wr garnring th last ars of th harvsts thy
had sown in arlir yars. But to th old countss thos contmporaris
of hrs smd to b th only srious and ral socity. Natásha saw by
Pirr’s animation that his visit had bn intrsting and that h had
much to tll thm but dar not say it bfor th old countss. Dnísov,
not bing a mmbr of th family, did not undrstand Pirr’s caution
and bing, as a malcontnt, much intrstd in what was occurring in
Ptrsburg, kpt urging Pirr to tll thm about what had happnd in
th Smënovsk rgimnt, thn about Arakchv, and thn about th Bibl
Socity. Onc or twic Pirr was carrid away and bgan to spak of
ths things, but Nicholas and Natásha always brought him back to th
halth of Princ Iván and Countss Mary Alxvna.
“Wll, and all this idiocy—Gossnr and Tatáwinova?” Dnísov askd. “Is
that wally still going on?”
“Going on?” Pirr xclaimd. “Why mor than vr! Th Bibl Socity is
th whol govrnmnt now!”
“What is that, mon chr ami?” askd th countss, who had finishd hr
ta and vidntly ndd a prtxt for bing angry aftr hr mal. “What
ar you saying about th govrnmnt? I don’t undrstand.”
“Wll, you know, Maman,” Nicholas intrposd, knowing how to translat
things into his mothr’s languag, “Princ Alxandr Golítsyn has
foundd a socity and in consqunc has grat influnc, thy say.”
“Arakchv and Golítsyn,” incautiously rmarkd Pirr, “ar now th
whol govrnmnt! And what a govrnmnt! Thy s trason vrywhr and
ar afraid of vrything.”
“Wll, and how is Princ Alxandr to blam? H is a most stimabl
man. I usd to mt him at Mary Antónovna’s,” said th countss in an
offndd ton; and still mor offndd that thy all rmaind silnt,
sh wnt on: “Nowadays vryon finds fault. A Gospl Socity! Wll, and
what harm is thr in that?” and sh ros (vrybody ls got up too)
and with a svr xprssion saild back to hr tabl in th sitting
room.
Th mlancholy silnc that followd was brokn by th sounds of th
childrn’s voics and laughtr from th nxt room. vidntly som jolly
xcitmnt was going on thr.
“Finishd, finishd!” littl Natásha’s glful yll ros abov thm all.
Pirr xchangd glancs with Countss Mary and Nicholas (Natásha h
nvr lost sight of) and smild happily.
“That’s dlightful music!” said h.
“It mans that Anna Makárovna has finishd hr stocking,” said Countss
Mary.
“Oh, I’ll go and s,” said Pirr, jumping up. “You know,” h addd,
stopping at th door, “why I’m spcially fond of that music? It is
always th first thing that tlls m all is wll. Whn I was driving
hr today, th narr I got to th hous th mor anxious I grw. As I
ntrd th antroom I hard Andrúsha’s pals of laughtr and that mant
that all was wll.”
“I know! I know that fling,” said Nicholas. “But I mustn’t go
thr—thos stockings ar to b a surpris for m.”
Pirr wnt to th childrn, and th shouting and laughtr grw still
loudr.
“Com, Anna Makárovna,” Pirr’s voic was hard saying, “com hr into
th middl of th room and at th word of command, ‘On, two,’ and
whn I say ‘thr’... You stand hr, and you in my arms—wll now! On,
two!...” said Pirr, and a silnc followd: “thr!” and a rapturously
brathlss cry of childrn’s voics filld th room. “Two, two!” thy
shoutd.
This mant two stockings, which by a scrt procss known only to
hrslf Anna Makárovna usd to knit at th sam tim on th sam
ndls, and which, whn thy wr rady, sh always triumphantly drw,
on out of th othr, in th childrn’s prsnc.
CHAPTR XIV
Soon aftr this th childrn cam in to say good night. Thy kissd
vryon, th tutors and govrnsss mad thir bows, and thy wnt out.
Only young Nicholas and his tutor rmaind. Dssalls whisprd to th
boy to com downstairs.
“No, Monsiur Dssalls, I will ask my aunt to lt m stay,” rplid
Nicholas Bolkónski also in a whispr.
“Ma tant, plas lt m stay,” said h, going up to his aunt.
His fac xprssd ntraty, agitation, and cstasy. Countss Mary
glancd at him and turnd to Pirr.
“Whn you ar hr h can’t tar himslf away,” sh said.
“I will bring him to you dirctly, Monsiur Dssalls. Good night!”
said Pirr, giving his hand to th Swiss tutor, and h turnd to young
Nicholas with a smil. “You and I havn’t sn anything of on anothr
yt.... How lik h is growing, Mary!” h addd, addrssing Countss
Mary.
“Lik my fathr?” askd th boy, flushing crimson and looking up at
Pirr with bright, cstatic ys.
Pirr noddd, and wnt on with what h had bn saying whn th
childrn had intrruptd. Countss Mary sat down doing woolwork; Natásha
did not tak hr ys off hr husband. Nicholas and Dnísov ros, askd
for thir pips, smokd, wnt to ftch mor ta from Sónya—who sat wary
but rsolut at th samovar—and qustiond Pirr. Th curly-hadd,
dlicat boy sat with shining ys unnoticd in a cornr, starting
vry now and thn and muttring somthing to himslf, and vidntly
xprincing a nw and powrful motion as h turnd his curly had,
with his thin nck xposd by his turn-down collar, toward th plac
whr Pirr sat.
Th convrsation turnd on th contmporary gossip about thos in powr,
in which most popl s th chif intrst of hom politics. Dnísov,
dissatisfid with th govrnmnt on account of his own disappointmnts
in th srvic, hard with plasur of th things don in Ptrsburg
which smd to him stupid, and mad forcibl and sharp commnts on what
Pirr told thm.
“On usd to hav to b a Grman—now on must danc with Tatáwinova
and Madam Kwüdnr, and wad cka’tshausn and th bwthwn. Oh, thy
should lt that fin fllow Bonapart loos—h’d knock all this nonsns
out of thm! Fancy giving th command of th Smënov wgimnt to a
fllow lik that Schwa’tz!” h crid.
Nicholas, though fr from Dnísov’s radinss to find fault with
vrything, also thought that discussion of th govrnmnt was a vry
srious and wighty mattr, and th fact that A had bn appointd
Ministr of This and B Govrnor Gnral of That, and that th mpror
had said so-and-so and this ministr so-and-so, smd to him vry
important. And so h thought it ncssary to tak an intrst in ths
things and to qustion Pirr. Th qustions put by ths two kpt th
convrsation from changing its ordinary charactr of gossip about th
highr govrnmnt circls.
But Natásha, knowing all hr husband’s ways and idas, saw that h had
long bn wishing but had bn unabl to divrt th convrsation to
anothr channl and xprss his own dply flt ida for th sak of
which h had gon to Ptrsburg to consult with his nw frind Princ
Thodor, and sh hlpd him by asking how his affairs with Princ
Thodor had gon.
“What was it about?” askd Nicholas.
“Always th sam thing,” said Pirr, looking round at his listnrs.
“vrybody ss that things ar going so badly that thy cannot b
allowd to go on so and that it is th duty of all dcnt mn to
countract it as far as thy can.”
“What can dcnt mn do?” Nicholas inquird, frowning slightly. “What
can b don?”
“Why, this...”
“Com into my study,” said Nicholas.
Natásha, who had long xpctd to b ftchd to nurs hr baby, now
hard th nurs calling hr and wnt to th nursry. Countss Mary
followd hr. Th mn wnt into th study and littl Nicholas Bolkónski
followd thm unnoticd by his uncl and sat down at th writing tabl
in a shady cornr by th window.
“Wll, what would you do?” askd Dnísov.
“Always som fantastic schms,” said Nicholas.
“Why this,” bgan Pirr, not sitting down but pacing th room,
somtims stopping short, gsticulating, and lisping: “th position
in Ptrsburg is this: th mpror dos not look into anything. H
has abandond himslf altogthr to this mysticism” (Pirr could not
tolrat mysticism in anyon now). “H sks only for pac, and only
ths popl sans foi ni loi * can giv it him—popl who rcklssly
hack at and strangl vrything—Magnítski, Arakchv, and tutti
quanti.... You will agr that if you did not look aftr your stats
yourslf but only wantd a quit lif, th harshr your stward was th
mor radily your objct might b attaind,” h said to Nicholas.
    * Without faith or law.
“Wll, what dos that lad up to?” said Nicholas.
“Wll, vrything is going to ruin! Robbry in th law courts, in th
army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Sttlmnts; th
popl ar torturd, nlightnmnt is supprssd. All that is young and
honst is crushd! vryon ss that this cannot go on. vrything is
straind to such a dgr that it will crtainly brak,” said Pirr (as
thos who xamin th actions of any govrnmnt hav always said sinc
govrnmnts bgan). “I told thm just on thing in Ptrsburg.”
“Told whom?”
“Wll, you know whom,” said Pirr, with a maning glanc from undr
his brows. “Princ Thodor and all thos. To ncourag cultur and
philanthropy is all vry wll of cours. Th aim is xcllnt but in th
prsnt circumstancs somthing ls is ndd.”
At that momnt Nicholas noticd th prsnc of his nphw. His fac
darknd and h wnt up to th boy.
“Why ar you hr?”
“Why? Lt him b,” said Pirr, taking Nicholas by th arm and
continuing. “That is not nough, I told thm. Somthing ls is ndd.
Whn you stand xpcting th ovrstraind string to snap at any momnt,
whn vryon is xpcting th invitabl catastroph, as many as
possibl must join hands as closly as thy can to withstand th gnral
calamity. vrything that is young and strong is bing nticd away and
dpravd. On is lurd by womn, anothr by honors, a third by ambition
or mony, and thy go ovr to that camp. No indpndnt mn, such as you
or I, ar lft. What I say is widn th scop of our socity, lt th
mot d’ordr b not virtu alon but indpndnc and action as wll!”
Nicholas, who had lft his nphw, irritably pushd up an armchair, sat
down in it, and listnd to Pirr, coughing discontntdly and frowning
mor and mor.
“But action with what aim?” h crid. “And what position will you adopt
toward th govrnmnt?”
“Why, th position of assistants. Th socity nd not b scrt if th
govrnmnt allows it. Not mrly is it not hostil to govrnmnt, but
it is a socity of tru consrvativs—a socity of gntlmn in th full
maning of that word. It is only to prvnt som Pugachëv or othr from
killing my childrn and yours, and Arakchv from snding m off to som
Military Sttlmnt. W join hands only for th public wlfar and th
gnral safty.”
“Ys, but it’s a scrt socity and thrfor a hostil and harmful on
which can only caus harm.”
“Why? Did th Tugndbund which savd urop” (thy did not thn vntur
to suggst that Russia had savd urop) “do any harm? Th Tugndbund
is an allianc of virtu: it is lov, mutual hlp... it is what Christ
prachd on th Cross.”
Natásha, who had com in during th convrsation, lookd joyfully at
hr husband. It was not what h was saying that plasd hr—that did not
vn intrst hr, for it smd to hr that was all xtrmly simpl
and that sh had known it a long tim (it smd so to hr bcaus sh
knw that it sprang from Pirr’s whol soul), but it was his animatd
and nthusiastic apparanc that mad hr glad.
Th boy with th thin nck strtching out from th turn-down collar—whom
vryon had forgottn—gazd at Pirr with vn gratr and mor
rapturous joy. vry word of Pirr’s burnd into his hart, and with a
nrvous movmnt of his fingrs h unconsciously brok th saling wax
and quill pns his hands cam upon on his uncl’s tabl.
“It is not at all what you suppos; but that is what th Grman
Tugndbund was, and what I am proposing.”
“No, my fwind! Th Tugndbund is all vwy wll for th sausag atrs,
but I don’t undrstand it and can’t vn pwonounc it,” intrposd
Dnísov in a loud and rsolut voic. “I agw that vwything hr is
wottn and howwibl, but th Tugndbund I don’t undrstand. If w’r
not satisfid, lt us hav a bunt of our own. That’s all wight. J suis
vot’ homm!” *
    * “I’m your man.”
Pirr smild, Natásha bgan to laugh, but Nicholas knittd his brows
still mor and bgan proving to Pirr that thr was no prospct of
any grat chang and that all th dangr h spok of xistd only in his
imagination. Pirr maintaind th contrary, and as his mntal facultis
wr gratr and mor rsourcful, Nicholas flt himslf cornrd. This
mad him still angrir, for h was fully convincd, not by rasoning
but by somthing within him strongr than rason, of th justic of his
opinion.
“I will tll you this,” h said, rising and trying with nrvously
twitching fingrs to prop up his pip in a cornr, but finally
abandoning th attmpt. “I can’t prov it to you. You say that
vrything hr is rottn and that an ovrthrow is coming: I don’t
s it. But you also say that our oath of allgianc is a conditional
mattr, and to that I rply: ‘You ar my bst frind, as you know,
but if you formd a scrt socity and bgan working against th
govrnmnt—b it what it may—I know it is my duty to oby th
govrnmnt. And if Arakchv ordrd m to lad a squadron against you
and cut you down, I should not hsitat an instant, but should do it.’
And you may argu about that as you lik!”
An awkward silnc followd ths words. Natásha was th first to spak,
dfnding hr husband and attacking hr brothr. Hr dfns was wak
and inapt but sh attaind hr objct. Th convrsation was rsumd, and
no longr in th unplasantly hostil ton of Nicholas’ last rmark.
Whn thy all got up to go in to suppr, littl Nicholas Bolkónski wnt
up to Pirr, pal and with shining, radiant ys.
“Uncl Pirr, you... no... If Papa wr aliv... would h agr with
you?” h askd.
And Pirr suddnly ralizd what a spcial, indpndnt, complx, and
powrful procss of thought and fling must hav bn going on in
this boy during that convrsation, and rmmbring all h had said h
rgrttd that th lad should hav hard him. H had, howvr, to giv
him an answr.
“Ys, I think so,” h said rluctantly, and lft th study.
Th lad lookd down and smd now for th first tim to notic what h
had don to th things on th tabl. H flushd and wnt up to Nicholas.
“Uncl, forgiv m, I did that... unintntionally,” h said, pointing to
th brokn saling wax and pns.
Nicholas startd angrily.
“All right, all right,” h said, throwing th bits undr th tabl.
And vidntly supprssing his vxation with difficulty, h turnd away
from th boy.
“You ought not to hav bn hr at all,” h said.
CHAPTR XV
Th convrsation at suppr was not about politics or socitis, but
turnd on th subjct Nicholas likd bst—rcollctions of 1812. Dnísov
startd ths and Pirr was particularly agrabl and amusing about
thm. Th family sparatd on th most frindly trms.
Aftr suppr Nicholas, having undrssd in his study and givn
instructions to th stward who had bn waiting for him, wnt to th
bdroom in his drssing gown, whr h found his wif still at hr
tabl, writing.
“What ar you writing, Mary?” Nicholas askd.
Countss Mary blushd. Sh was afraid that what sh was writing would
not b undrstood or approvd by hr husband.
Sh had wantd to concal what sh was writing from him, but at th sam
tim was glad h had surprisd hr at it and that sh would now hav to
tll him.
“A diary, Nicholas,” sh rplid, handing him a blu xrcis book
filld with hr firm, bold writing.
“A diary?” Nicholas rpatd with a shad of irony, and h took up th
book.
It was in Frnch.
Dcmbr 4. Today whn Andrúsha (hr ldst boy) wok up h did not
wish to drss and Madmoisll Louis snt for m. H was naughty and
obstinat. I trid thrats, but h only grw angrir. Thn I took th
mattr in hand: I lft him alon and bgan with nurs’s hlp to gt th
othr childrn up, tlling him that I did not lov him. For a long tim
h was silnt, as if astonishd, thn h jumpd out of bd, ran to m in
his shirt, and sobbd so that I could not calm him for a long tim.
It was plain that what troubld him most was that h had grivd m.
Aftrwards in th vning whn I gav him his tickt, h again bgan
crying pitously and kissing m. On can do anything with him by
tndrnss.
“What is a ‘tickt’?” Nicholas inquird.
“I hav bgun giving th ldr ons marks vry vning, showing how
thy hav bhavd.”
Nicholas lookd into th radiant ys that wr gazing at him, and
continud to turn ovr th pags and rad. In th diary was st down
vrything in th childrn’s livs that smd notworthy to thir
mothr as showing thir charactrs or suggsting gnral rflctions
on ducational mthods. Thy wr for th most part quit insignificant
trifls, but did not sm so to th mothr or to th fathr ithr, now
that h rad this diary about his childrn for th first tim.
Undr th dat “5” was ntrd:
Mítya was naughty at tabl. Papa said h was to hav no pudding. H had
non, but lookd so unhappily and grdily at th othrs whil thy wr
ating! I think that punishmnt by dpriving childrn of swts only
dvlops thir grdinss. Must tll Nicholas this.
Nicholas put down th book and lookd at his wif. Th radiant ys
gazd at him qustioningly: would h approv or disapprov of hr
diary? Thr could b no doubt not only of his approval but also of his
admiration for his wif.
Prhaps it nd not b don so pdantically, thought Nicholas, or vn
don at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual ffort of which th
sol aim was th childrn’s moral wlfar dlightd him. Had Nicholas
bn abl to analyz his flings h would hav found that his stady,
tndr, and proud lov of his wif rstd on his fling of wondr at
hr spirituality and at th lofty moral world, almost byond his rach,
in which sh had hr bing.
H was proud of hr intllignc and goodnss, rcognizd his own
insignificanc bsid hr in th spiritual world, and rjoicd all th
mor that sh with such a soul not only blongd to him but was part of
himslf.
“I quit, quit approv, my darst!” said h with a significant look,
and aftr a short paus h addd: “And I bhavd badly today. You
wrn’t in th study. W bgan disputing—Pirr and I—and I lost my
tmpr. But h is impossibl: such a child! I don’t know what would
bcom of him if Natásha didn’t kp him in hand.... Hav you any ida
why h wnt to Ptrsburg? Thy hav formd...”
“Ys, I know,” said Countss Mary. “Natásha told m.”
“Wll, thn, you know,” Nicholas wnt on, growing hot at th mr
rcollction of thir discussion, “h wantd to convinc m that it is
vry honst man’s duty to go against th govrnmnt, and that th oath
of allgianc and duty... I am sorry you wrn’t thr. Thy all fll on
m—Dnísov and Natásha... Natásha is absurd. How sh ruls ovr him! And
yt thr nd only b a discussion and sh has no words of hr own
but only rpats his sayings...” addd Nicholas, yilding to that
irrsistibl inclination which tmpts us to judg thos narst and
darst to us. H forgot that what h was saying about Natásha could
hav bn applid word for word to himslf in rlation to his wif.
“Ys, I hav noticd that,” said Countss Mary.
“Whn I told him that duty and th oath wr abov vrything, h
startd proving goodnss knows what! A pity you wr not thr—what
would you hav said?”
“As I s it you wr quit right, and I told Natásha so. Pirr says
vrybody is suffring, torturd, and bing corruptd, and that it
is our duty to hlp our nighbor. Of cours h is right thr,” said
Countss Mary, “but h forgts that w hav othr dutis narr to us,
dutis indicatd to us by God Himslf, and that though w might xpos
ourslvs to risks w must not risk our childrn.”
“Ys, that’s it! That’s just what I said to him,” put in Nicholas, who
fancid h rally had said it. “But thy insistd on thir own viw:
lov of on’s nighbor and Christianity—and all this in th prsnc of
young Nicholas, who had gon into my study and brok all my things.”
“Ah, Nicholas, do you know I am oftn troubld about littl Nicholas,”
said Countss Mary. “H is such an xcptional boy. I am afraid I
nglct him in favor of my own: w all hav childrn and rlations whil
h has no on. H is constantly alon with his thoughts.”
“Wll, I don’t think you nd rproach yourslf on his account. All that
th fondst mothr could do for hr son you hav don and ar doing for
him, and of cours I am glad of it. H is a fin lad, a fin lad! This
vning h listnd to Pirr in a sort of tranc, and fancy—as w wr
going in to suppr I lookd and h had brokn vrything on my tabl to
bits, and h told m of it himslf at onc! I nvr knw him to tll an
untruth. A fin lad, a fin lad!” rpatd Nicholas, who at hart was
not fond of Nicholas Bolkónski but was always anxious to rcogniz that
h was a fin lad.
“Still, I am not th sam as his own mothr,” said Countss Mary. “I
fl I am not th sam and it troubls m. A wondrful boy, but I am
dradfully afraid for him. It would b good for him to hav companions.”
“Wll it won’t b for long. Nxt summr I’ll tak him to Ptrsburg,”
said Nicholas. “Ys, Pirr always was a dramr and always will b,”
h continud, rturning to th talk in th study which had vidntly
disturbd him. “Wll, what businss is it of min what gos on
thr—whthr Arakchv is bad, and all that? What businss was it of
min whn I marrid and was so dp in dbt that I was thratnd with
prison, and had a mothr who could not s or undrstand it? And
thn thr ar you and th childrn and our affairs. Is it for my own
plasur that I am at th farm or in th offic from morning to night?
No, but I know I must work to comfort my mothr, to rpay you, and not
to lav th childrn such bggars as I was.”
Countss Mary wantd to tll him that man dos not liv by brad alon
and that h attachd too much importanc to ths mattrs. But sh knw
sh must not say this and that it would b uslss to do so. Sh only
took his hand and kissd it. H took this as a sign of approval and
a confirmation of his thoughts, and aftr a fw minuts’ rflction
continud to think aloud.
“You know, Mary, today lias Mitrofánych” (this was his ovrsr) “cam
back from th Tambóv stat and told m thy ar alrady offring ighty
thousand rubls for th forst.”
And with an agr fac Nicholas bgan to spak of th possibility of
rpurchasing Otrádno bfor long, and addd: “Anothr tn yars of lif
and I shall lav th childrn... in an xcllnt position.”
Countss Mary listnd to hr husband and undrstood all that h told
hr. Sh knw that whn h thought aloud in this way h would somtims
ask hr what h had bn saying, and b vxd if h noticd that sh
had bn thinking about somthing ls. But sh had to forc hrslf to
attnd, for what h was saying did not intrst hr at all. Sh lookd
at him and did not think, but flt, about somthing diffrnt. Sh flt
a submissiv tndr lov for this man who would nvr undrstand all
that sh undrstood, and this smd to mak hr lov for him still
strongr and addd a touch of passionat tndrnss. Bsids this
fling which absorbd hr altogthr and hindrd hr from following
th dtails of hr husband’s plans, thoughts that had no connction with
what h was saying flittd through hr mind. Sh thought of hr nphw.
Hr husband’s account of th boy’s agitation whil Pirr was spaking
struck hr forcibly, and various traits of his gntl, snsitiv
charactr rcurrd to hr mind; and whil thinking of hr nphw sh
thought also of hr own childrn. Sh did not compar thm with him, but
compard hr fling for thm with hr fling for him, and flt
with rgrt that thr was somthing lacking in hr fling for young
Nicholas.
Somtims it smd to hr that this diffrnc aros from th
diffrnc in thir ags, but sh flt hrslf to blam toward him and
promisd in hr hart to do bttr and to accomplish th impossibl—in
this lif to lov hr husband, hr childrn, littl Nicholas, and all
hr nighbors, as Christ lovd mankind. Countss Mary’s soul always
strov toward th infinit, th trnal, and th absolut, and could
thrfor nvr b at pac. A strn xprssion of th lofty, scrt
suffring of a soul burdnd by th body appard on hr fac. Nicholas
gazd at hr. “O God! What will bcom of us if sh dis, as I always
far whn hr fac is lik that?” thought h, and placing himslf bfor
th icon h bgan to say his vning prayrs.
CHAPTR XVI
Natásha and Pirr, lft alon, also bgan to talk as only a husband
and wif can talk, that is, with xtraordinary clarnss and rapidity,
undrstanding and xprssing ach othr’s thoughts in ways contrary to
all ruls of logic, without prmiss, dductions, or conclusions, and in
a quit pculiar way. Natásha was so usd to this kind of talk with hr
husband that for hr it was th surst sign of somthing bing wrong
btwn thm if Pirr followd a lin of logical rasoning. Whn h
bgan proving anything, or talking argumntativly and calmly and sh,
ld on by his xampl, bgan to do th sam, sh knw that thy wr on
th vrg of a quarrl.
From th momnt thy wr alon and Natásha cam up to him with
wid-opn happy ys, and quickly sizing his had prssd it to hr
bosom, saying: “Now you ar all min, min! You won’t scap!”—from that
momnt this convrsation bgan, contrary to all th laws of logic and
contrary to thm bcaus quit diffrnt subjcts wr talkd about at
on and th sam tim. This simultanous discussion of many topics did
not prvnt a clar undrstanding but on th contrary was th surst
sign that thy fully undrstood on anothr.
Just as in a dram whn all is uncrtain, unrasoning, and
contradictory, xcpt th fling that guids th dram, so in this
intrcours contrary to all laws of rason, th words thmslvs wr
not conscutiv and clar but only th fling that promptd thm.
Natásha spok to Pirr about hr brothr’s lif and doings, of how sh
had suffrd and lackd lif during his own absnc, and of how sh
was fondr than vr of Mary, and how Mary was in vry way bttr than
hrslf. In saying this Natásha was sincr in acknowldging Mary’s
supriority, but at th sam tim by saying it sh mad a dmand on
Pirr that h should, all th sam, prfr hr to Mary and to all
othr womn, and that now, spcially aftr having sn many womn in
Ptrsburg, h should tll hr so afrsh.
Pirr, answring Natásha’s words, told hr how intolrabl it had bn
for him to mt ladis at dinnrs and balls in Ptrsburg.
“I hav quit lost th knack of talking to ladis,” h said. “It was
simply dull. Bsids, I was vry busy.”
Natásha lookd intntly at him and wnt on:
“Mary is so splndid,” sh said. “How sh undrstands childrn! It is as
if sh saw straight into thir souls. Ystrday, for instanc, Mítya was
naughty...”
“How lik his fathr h is,” Pirr intrjctd.
Natásha knw why h mntiond Mítya’s liknss to Nicholas: th
rcollction of his disput with his brothr-in-law was unplasant and
h wantd to know what Natásha thought of it.
“Nicholas has th waknss of nvr agring with anything not gnrally
accptd. But I undrstand that you valu what opns up a frsh lin,”
said sh, rpating words Pirr had onc uttrd.
“No, th chif point is that to Nicholas idas and discussions ar
an amusmnt—almost a pastim,” said Pirr. “For instanc, h is
collcting a library and has mad it a rul not to buy a nw book
till h has rad what h had alrady bought—Sismondi and Roussau and
Montsquiu,” h addd with a smil. “You know how much I...” h bgan
to softn down what h had said; but Natásha intrruptd him to show
that this was unncssary.
“So you say idas ar an amusmnt to him....”
“Ys, and for m nothing ls is srious. All th tim in Ptrsburg I
saw vryon as in a dram. Whn I am takn up by a thought, all ls is
mr amusmnt.”
“Ah, I’m so sorry I wasn’t thr whn you mt th childrn,” said
Natásha. “Which was most dlightd? Lisa, I’m sur.”
“Ys,” Pirr rplid, and wnt on with what was in his mind. “Nicholas
says w ought not to think. But I can’t hlp it. Bsids, whn I was in
Ptrsburg I flt (I can say this to you) that th whol affair would go
to pics without m—vryon was pulling his own way. But I succdd
in uniting thm all; and thn my ida is so clar and simpl. You s,
I don’t say that w ought to oppos this and that. W may b mistakn.
What I say is: ‘Join hands, you who lov th right, and lt thr b but
on bannr—that of activ virtu.’ Princ Srgy is a fin fllow and
clvr.”
Natásha would hav had no doubt as to th gratnss of Pirr’s ida,
but on thing disconcrtd hr. “Can a man so important and ncssary to
socity b also my husband? How did this happn?” Sh wishd to xprss
this doubt to him. “Now who could dcid whthr h is rally clvrr
than all th othrs?” sh askd hrslf, and passd in rviw all thos
whom Pirr most rspctd. Judging by what h had said thr was no on
h had rspctd so highly as Platón Karatáv.
“Do you know what I am thinking about?” sh askd. “About Platón
Karatáv. Would h hav approvd of you now, do you think?”
Pirr was not at all surprisd at this qustion. H undrstood his
wif’s lin of thought.
“Platón Karatáv?” h rpatd, and pondrd, vidntly sincrly
trying to imagin Karatáv’s opinion on th subjct. “H would not hav
undrstood... yt prhaps h would.”
“I lov you awfully!” Natásha suddnly said. “Awfully, awfully!”
“No, h would not hav approvd,” said Pirr, aftr rflction. “What
h would hav approvd of is our family lif. H was always so anxious
to find smlinss, happinss, and pac in vrything, and I should
hav bn proud to lt him s us. Thr now—you talk of my absnc,
but you wouldn’t bliv what a spcial fling I hav for you aftr a
sparation....”
“Ys, I should think...” Natásha bgan.
“No, it’s not that. I nvr lav off loving you. And on couldn’t lov
mor, but this is somthing spcial.... Ys, of cours—” h did not
finish bcaus thir ys mting said th rst.
“What nonsns it is,” Natásha suddnly xclaimd, “about honymoons,
and that th gratst happinss is at first! On th contrary, now is
th bst of all. If only you did not go away! Do you rmmbr how
w quarrld? And it was always my fault. Always min. And what w
quarrld about—I don’t vn rmmbr!”
“Always about th sam thing,” said Pirr with a smil. “Jalo...”
“Don’t say it! I can’t bar it!” Natásha crid, and hr ys glittrd
coldly and vindictivly. “Did you s hr?” sh addd, aftr a paus.
“No, and if I had I shouldn’t hav rcognizd hr.”
Thy wr silnt for a whil.
“Oh, do you know? Whil you wr talking in th study I was looking at
you,” Natásha bgan, vidntly anxious to disprs th cloud that had
com ovr thm. “You ar as lik him as two pas—lik th boy.” (Sh
mant hr littl son.) “Oh, it’s tim to go to him.... Th milk’s
com.... But I’m sorry to lav you.”
Thy wr silnt for a fw sconds. Thn suddnly turning to on
anothr at th sam tim thy both bgan to spak. Pirr bgan with
slf-satisfaction and nthusiasm, Natásha with a quit, happy smil.
Having intrruptd on anothr thy both stoppd to lt th othr
continu.
“No. What did you say? Go on, go on.”
“No, you go on, I was talking nonsns,” said Natásha.
Pirr finishd what h had bgun. It was th squl to his complacnt
rflctions on his succss in Ptrsburg. At that momnt it smd to
him that h was chosn to giv a nw dirction to th whol of Russian
socity and to th whol world.
“I only wishd to say that idas that hav grat rsults ar always
simpl ons. My whol ida is that if vicious popl ar unitd and
constitut a powr, thn honst folk must do th sam. Now that’s simpl
nough.”
“Ys.”
“And what wr you going to say?”
“I? Only nonsns.”
“But all th sam?”
“Oh nothing, only a trifl,” said Natásha, smiling still mor brightly.
“I only wantd to tll you about Ptya: today nurs was coming to tak
him from m, and h laughd, shut his ys, and clung to m. I’m sur
h thought h was hiding. Awfully swt! Thr, now h’s crying. Wll,
good-by!” and sh lft th room.
Manwhil downstairs in young Nicholas Bolkónski’s bdroom a littl lamp
was burning as usual. (Th boy was afraid of th dark and thy could
not cur him of it.) Dssalls slpt proppd up on four pillows and his
Roman nos mittd sounds of rhythmic snoring. Littl Nicholas, who had
just wakd up in a cold prspiration, sat up in bd and gazd bfor him
with wid-opn ys. H had awakd from a trribl dram. H had dramd
that h and Uncl Pirr, waring hlmts such as wr dpictd in
his Plutarch, wr lading a hug army. Th army was mad up of whit
slanting lins that filld th air lik th cobwbs that float about in
autumn and which Dssalls calld ls fils d la Vièrg. In front was
Glory, which was similar to thos thrads but rathr thickr. H and
Pirr wr born along lightly and joyously, narr and narr to thir
goal. Suddnly th thrads that movd thm bgan to slackn and bcom
ntangld and it grw difficult to mov. And Uncl Nicholas stood bfor
thm in a strn and thratning attitud.
“Hav you don this?” h said, pointing to som brokn saling wax and
pns. “I lovd you, but I hav ordrs from Arakchv and will kill
th first of you who movs forward.” Littl Nicholas turnd to look
at Pirr but Pirr was no longr thr. In his plac was his
fathr—Princ Andrw—and his fathr had nithr shap nor form, but h
xistd, and whn littl Nicholas prcivd him h grw faint with lov:
h flt himslf powrlss, limp, and formlss. His fathr carssd and
pitid him. But Uncl Nicholas cam narr and narr to thm. Trror
sizd young Nicholas and h awok.
“My fathr!” h thought. (Though thr wr two good portraits of Princ
Andrw in th hous, Nicholas nvr imagind him in human form.) “My
fathr has bn with m and carssd m. H approvd of m and of Uncl
Pirr. Whatvr h may tll m, I will do it. Mucius Scavola burnd
his hand. Why should not th sam sort of thing happn to m? I know
thy want m to larn. And I will larn. But somday I shall hav
finishd larning, and thn I will do somthing. I only pray God that
somthing may happn to m such as happnd to Plutarch’s mn, and I
will act as thy did. I will do bttr. vryon shall know m, lov m,
and b dlightd with m!” And suddnly his bosom havd with sobs and
h bgan to cry.
“Ar you ill?” h hard Dssalls’ voic asking.
“No,” answrd Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.
“H is good and kind and I am fond of him!” h thought of Dssalls.
“But Uncl Pirr! Oh, what a wondrful man h is! And my fathr? Oh,
Fathr, Fathr! Ys, I will do somthing with which vn h would b
satisfid....”

CHAPTR I
History is th lif of nations and of humanity. To siz and put into
words, to dscrib dirctly th lif of humanity or vn of a singl
nation, appars impossibl.
Th ancint historians all mployd on and th sam mthod to dscrib
and siz th apparntly lusiv—th lif of a popl. Thy dscribd
th activity of individuals who ruld th popl, and rgardd th
activity of thos mn as rprsnting th activity of th whol nation.
Th qustion: how did individuals mak nations act as thy wishd and by
what was th will of ths individuals thmslvs guidd? th ancints
mt by rcognizing a divinity which subjctd th nations to th will of
a chosn man, and guidd th will of that chosn man so as to accomplish
nds that wr prdstind.
For th ancints ths qustions wr solvd by a blif in th dirct
participation of th Dity in human affairs.
Modrn history, in thory, rjcts both ths principls.
It would sm that having rjctd th blif of th ancints in man’s
subjction to th Dity and in a prdtrmind aim toward which nations
ar ld, modrn history should study not th manifstations of powr but
th causs that produc it. But modrn history has not don this. Having
in thory rjctd th viw hld by th ancints, it still follows thm
in practic.
Instad of mn ndowd with divin authority and dirctly guidd by
th will of God, modrn history has givn us ithr hros ndowd with
xtraordinary, suprhuman capacitis, or simply mn of vry various
kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lad th masss. Instad of th
formr divinly appointd aims of th Jwish, Grk, or Roman nations,
which ancint historians rgardd as rprsnting th progrss of
humanity, modrn history has postulatd its own aims—th wlfar of th
Frnch, Grman, or nglish popl, or, in its highst abstraction, th
wlfar and civilization of humanity in gnral, by which is usually
mant that of th popls occupying a small northwstrly portion of a
larg continnt.
Modrn history has rjctd th blifs of th ancints without
rplacing thm by a nw concption, and th logic of th situation has
obligd th historians, aftr thy had apparntly rjctd th divin
authority of th kings and th “fat” of th ancints, to rach th sam
conclusion by anothr road, that is, to rcogniz (1) nations guidd
by individual mn, and (2) th xistnc of a known aim to which ths
nations and humanity at larg ar tnding.
At th basis of th works of all th modrn historians from Gibbon to
Buckl, dspit thir sming disagrmnts and th apparnt novlty of
thir outlooks, li thos two old, unavoidabl assumptions.
In th first plac th historian dscribs th activity of individuals
who in his opinion hav dirctd humanity (on historian considrs
only monarchs, gnrals, and ministrs as bing such mn, whil anothr
includs also orators, larnd mn, rformrs, philosophrs, and pots).
Scondly, it is assumd that th goal toward which humanity is bing ld
is known to th historians: to on of thm this goal is th gratnss of
th Roman, Spanish, or Frnch ralm; to anothr it is librty, quality,
and a crtain kind of civilization of a small cornr of th world calld
urop.
In 1789 a frmnt ariss in Paris; it grows, sprads, and is xprssd
by a movmnt of popls from wst to ast. Svral tims it movs
astward and collids with a countrmovmnt from th ast wstward.
In 1812 it rachs its xtrm limit, Moscow, and thn, with rmarkabl
symmtry, a countrmovmnt occurs from ast to wst, attracting to
it, as th first movmnt had don, th nations of middl urop. Th
countr movmnt rachs th starting point of th first movmnt in th
wst—Paris—and subsids.
During that twnty-yar priod an immns numbr of filds wr lft
untilld, houss wr burnd, trad changd its dirction, millions
of mn migratd, wr impovrishd, or wr nrichd, and millions
of Christian mn profssing th law of lov of thir fllows slw on
anothr.
What dos all this man? Why did it happn? What mad thos popl burn
houss and slay thir fllow mn? What wr th causs of ths vnts?
What forc mad mn act so? Ths ar th instinctiv, plain, and
most lgitimat qustions humanity asks itslf whn it ncountrs th
monumnts and tradition of that priod.
For a rply to ths qustions th common sns of mankind turns to th
scinc of history, whos aim is to nabl nations and humanity to know
thmslvs.
If history had rtaind th concption of th ancints it would hav
said that God, to rward or punish his popl, gav Napolon powr and
dirctd his will to th fulfillmnt of th divin nds, and that rply
would hav bn clar and complt. On might bliv or disbliv
in th divin significanc of Napolon, but for anyon bliving in
it thr would hav bn nothing unintlligibl in th history of that
priod, nor would thr hav bn any contradictions.
But modrn history cannot giv that rply. Scinc dos not admit th
concption of th ancints as to th dirct participation of th Dity
in human affairs, and thrfor history ought to giv othr answrs.
Modrn history rplying to ths qustions says: you want to know what
this movmnt mans, what causd it, and what forc producd ths
vnts? Thn listn:
“Louis XIV was a vry proud and slf-confidnt man; h had such and such
mistrsss and such and such ministrs and h ruld Franc badly. His
dscndants wr wak mn and thy too ruld Franc badly. And thy had
such and such favorits and such and such mistrsss. Morovr, crtain
mn wrot som books at that tim. At th nd of th ightnth cntury
thr wr a coupl of dozn mn in Paris who bgan to talk about all
mn bing fr and qual. This causd popl all ovr Franc to bgin
to slash at and drown on anothr. Thy killd th king and many othr
popl. At that tim thr was in Franc a man of gnius—Napolon. H
conqurd vrybody vrywhr—that is, h killd many popl bcaus
h was a grat gnius. And for som rason h wnt to kill Africans, and
killd thm so wll and was so cunning and wis that whn h rturnd to
Franc h ordrd vrybody to oby him, and thy all obyd him. Having
bcom an mpror h again wnt out to kill popl in Italy, Austria,
and Prussia. And thr too h killd a grat many. In Russia thr
was an mpror, Alxandr, who dcidd to rstor ordr in urop and
thrfor fought against Napolon. In 1807 h suddnly mad frinds
with him, but in 1811 thy again quarrld and again bgan killing many
popl. Napolon ld six hundrd thousand mn into Russia and capturd
Moscow; thn h suddnly ran away from Moscow, and th mpror
Alxandr, hlpd by th advic of Stin and othrs, unitd urop to
arm against th disturbr of its pac. All Napolon’s allis suddnly
bcam his nmis and thir forcs advancd against th frsh forcs h
raisd. Th Allis dfatd Napolon, ntrd Paris, forcd Napolon to
abdicat, and snt him to th island of lba, not dpriving him of th
titl of mpror and showing him vry rspct, though fiv yars bfor
and on yar latr thy all rgardd him as an outlaw and a brigand.
Thn Louis XVIII, who till thn had bn th laughingstock both of th
Frnch and th Allis, bgan to rign. And Napolon, shdding tars
bfor his Old Guards, rnouncd th thron and wnt into xil. Thn
th skillful statsmn and diplomatists (spcially Tallyrand, who
managd to sit down in a particular chair bfor anyon ls and
thrby xtndd th frontirs of Franc) talkd in Vinna and by
ths convrsations mad th nations happy or unhappy. Suddnly th
diplomatists and monarchs narly quarrld and wr on th point of
again ordring thir armis to kill on anothr, but just thn Napolon
arrivd in Franc with a battalion, and th Frnch, who had bn hating
him, immdiatly all submittd to him. But th Allid monarchs wr
angry at this and wnt to fight th Frnch onc mor. And thy dfatd
th gnius Napolon and, suddnly rcognizing him as a brigand, snt him
to th island of St. Hlna. And th xil, sparatd from th blovd
Franc so dar to his hart, did a lingring dath on that rock and
bquathd his grat dds to postrity. But in urop a raction
occurrd and th sovrigns onc again all bgan to opprss thir
subjcts.”
It would b a mistak to think that this is ironic—a caricatur of th
historical accounts. On th contrary it is a vry mild xprssion of
th contradictory rplis, not mting th qustions, which all th
historians giv, from th compilrs of mmoirs and th historis
of sparat stats to th writrs of gnral historis and th nw
historis of th cultur of that priod.
Th strangnss and absurdity of ths rplis aris from th fact that
modrn history, lik a daf man, answrs qustions no on has askd.
If th purpos of history b to giv a dscription of th movmnt of
humanity and of th popls, th first qustion—in th absnc of a
rply to which all th rst will b incomprhnsibl—is: what is th
powr that movs popls? To this, modrn history laboriously rplis
ithr that Napolon was a grat gnius, or that Louis XIV was vry
proud, or that crtain writrs wrot crtain books.
All that may b so and mankind is rady to agr with it, but it is not
what was askd. All that would b intrsting if w rcognizd a divin
powr basd on itslf and always consistntly dircting its nations
through Napolons, Louis-s, and writrs; but w do not acknowldg such
a powr, and thrfor bfor spaking about Napolons, Louis-s, and
authors, w ought to b shown th connction xisting btwn ths mn
and th movmnt of th nations.
If instad of a divin powr som othr forc has appard, it should
b xplaind in what this nw forc consists, for th whol intrst of
history lis prcisly in that forc.
History sms to assum that this forc is slf-vidnt and known to
vryon. But in spit of vry dsir to rgard it as known, anyon
rading many historical works cannot hlp doubting whthr this nw
forc, so variously undrstood by th historians thmslvs, is rally
quit wll known to vrybody.
CHAPTR II
What forc movs th nations?
Biographical historians and historians of sparat nations undrstand
this forc as a powr inhrnt in hros and rulrs. In thir narration
vnts occur solly by th will of a Napolon, and Alxandr, or in
gnral of th prsons thy dscrib. Th answrs givn by this kind
of historian to th qustion of what forc causs vnts to happn ar
satisfactory only as long as thr is but on historian to ach vnt.
As soon as historians of diffrnt nationalitis and tndncis bgin
to dscrib th sam vnt, th rplis thy giv immdiatly los all
maning, for this forc is undrstood by thm all not only diffrntly
but oftn in quit contradictory ways. On historian says that an
vnt was producd by Napolon’s powr, anothr that it was producd by
Alxandr’s, a third that it was du to th powr of som othr prson.
Bsids this, historians of that kind contradict ach othr vn
in thir statmnt as to th forc on which th authority of som
particular prson was basd. Thirs, a Bonapartist, says that Napolon’s
powr was basd on his virtu and gnius. Lanfry, a Rpublican, says it
was basd on his trickry and dcption of th popl. So th historians
of this class, by mutually dstroying on anothr’s positions, dstroy
th undrstanding of th forc which producs vnts, and furnish no
rply to history’s ssntial qustion.
Writrs of univrsal history who dal with all th nations sm to
rcogniz how rronous is th spcialist historians’ viw of th forc
which producs vnts. Thy do not rcogniz it as a powr inhrnt in
hros and rulrs, but as th rsultant of a multiplicity of variously
dirctd forcs. In dscribing a war or th subjugation of a popl, a
gnral historian looks for th caus of th vnt not in th powr
of on man, but in th intraction of many prsons connctd with th
vnt.
According to this viw th powr of historical prsonags, rprsntd
as th product of many forcs, can no longr, it would sm, b rgardd
as a forc that itslf producs vnts. Yt in most cass univrsal
historians still mploy th concption of powr as a forc that itslf
producs vnts, and trat it as thir caus. In thir xposition, an
historic charactr is first th product of his tim, and his powr only
th rsultant of various forcs, and thn his powr is itslf a forc
producing vnts. Grvinus, Schlossr, and othrs, for instanc, at on
tim prov Napolon to b a product of th Rvolution, of th idas of
1789 and so forth, and at anothr plainly say that th campaign of 1812
and othr things thy do not lik wr simply th product of Napolon’s
misdirctd will, and that th vry idas of 1789 wr arrstd in thir
dvlopmnt by Napolon’s capric. Th idas of th Rvolution and th
gnral tmpr of th ag producd Napolon’s powr. But Napolon’s
powr supprssd th idas of th Rvolution and th gnral tmpr of
th ag.
This curious contradiction is not accidntal. Not only dos it occur at
vry stp, but th univrsal historians’ accounts ar all mad up of
a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs bcaus aftr
ntring th fild of analysis th univrsal historians stop halfway.
To find componnt forcs qual to th composit or rsultant forc, th
sum of th componnts must qual th rsultant. This condition is nvr
obsrvd by th univrsal historians, and so to xplain th rsultant
forcs thy ar obligd to admit, in addition to th insufficint
componnts, anothr unxplaind forc affcting th rsultant action.
Spcialist historians dscribing th campaign of 1813 or th rstoration
of th Bourbons plainly assrt that ths vnts wr producd by th
will of Alxandr. But th univrsal historian Grvinus, rfuting this
opinion of th spcialist historian, tris to prov that th campaign of
1813 and th rstoration of th Bourbons wr du to othr things bsid
Alxandr’s will—such as th activity of Stin, Mttrnich, Madam d
Staël, Tallyrand, Ficht, Chataubriand, and othrs. Th historian
vidntly dcomposs Alxandr’s powr into th componnts: Tallyrand,
Chataubriand, and th rst—but th sum of th componnts, that is,
th intractions of Chataubriand, Tallyrand, Madam d Staël, and th
othrs, vidntly dos not qual th rsultant, namly th phnomnon
of millions of Frnchmn submitting to th Bourbons. That Chataubriand,
Madam d Staël, and othrs spok crtain words to on anothr only
affctd thir mutual rlations but dos not account for th submission
of millions. And thrfor to xplain how from ths rlations of thirs
th submission of millions of popl rsultd—that is, how componnt
forcs qual to on A gav a rsultant qual to a thousand tims A—th
historian is again obligd to fall back on powr—th forc h had
dnid—and to rcogniz it as th rsultant of th forcs, that is, h
has to admit an unxplaind forc acting on th rsultant. And that is
just what th univrsal historians do, and consquntly thy not only
contradict th spcialist historians but contradict thmslvs.
Pasants having no clar ida of th caus of rain, say, according to
whthr thy want rain or fin wathr: “Th wind has blown th clouds
away,” or, “Th wind has brought up th clouds.” And in th sam way th
univrsal historians somtims, whn it plass thm and fits in with
thir thory, say that powr is th rsult of vnts, and somtims,
whn thy want to prov somthing ls, say that powr producs vnts.
A third class of historians—th so-calld historians of
cultur—following th path laid down by th univrsal historians who
somtims accpt writrs and ladis as forcs producing vnts—again
tak that forc to b somthing quit diffrnt. Thy s it in what is
calld cultur—in mntal activity.
Th historians of cultur ar quit consistnt in rgard to thir
prognitors, th writrs of univrsal historis, for if historical
vnts may b xplaind by th fact that crtain prsons tratd on
anothr in such and such ways, why not xplain thm by th fact that
such and such popl wrot such and such books? Of th immns numbr of
indications accompanying vry vital phnomnon, ths historians slct
th indication of intllctual activity and say that this indication is
th caus. But dspit thir ndavors to prov that th caus of vnts
lis in intllctual activity, only by a grat strtch can on admit
that thr is any connction btwn intllctual activity and th
movmnt of popls, and in no cas can on admit that intllctual
activity controls popl’s actions, for that viw is not confirmd by
such facts as th vry crul murdrs of th Frnch Rvolution rsulting
from th doctrin of th quality of man, or th vry crul wars and
xcutions rsulting from th praching of lov.
But vn admitting as corrct all th cunningly dvisd argumnts with
which ths historis ar filld—admitting that nations ar govrnd by
som undfind forc calld an ida—history’s ssntial qustion still
rmains unanswrd, and to th formr powr of monarchs and to th
influnc of advisrs and othr popl introducd by th univrsal
historians, anothr, nwr forc—th ida—is addd, th connction of
which with th masss nds xplanation. It is possibl to undrstand
that Napolon had powr and so vnts occurrd; with som ffort on may
vn conciv that Napolon togthr with othr influncs was th caus
of an vnt; but how a book, L Contrat Social, had th ffct of making
Frnchmn bgin to drown on anothr cannot b undrstood without an
xplanation of th causal nxus of this nw forc with th vnt.
Undoubtdly som rlation xists btwn all who liv contmporanously,
and so it is possibl to find som connction btwn th intllctual
activity of mn and thir historical movmnts, just as such a
connction may b found btwn th movmnts of humanity and commrc,
handicraft, gardning, or anything ls you plas. But why intllctual
activity is considrd by th historians of cultur to b th caus or
xprssion of th whol historical movmnt is hard to undrstand.
Only th following considrations can hav ld th historians to such
a conclusion: (1) that history is writtn by larnd mn, and so it is
natural and agrabl for thm to think that th activity of thir class
supplis th basis of th movmnt of all humanity, just as a similar
blif is natural and agrabl to tradrs, agriculturists, and soldirs
(if thy do not xprss it, that is mrly bcaus tradrs and soldirs
do not writ history), and (2) that spiritual activity, nlightnmnt,
civilization, cultur, idas, ar all indistinct, indfinit concptions
undr whos bannr it is vry asy to us words having a still lss
dfinit maning, and which can thrfor b radily introducd into any
thory.
But not to spak of th intrinsic quality of historis of this kind
(which may possibly vn b of us to somon for somthing) th
historis of cultur, to which all gnral historis tnd mor and mor
to approximat, ar significant from th fact that aftr sriously
and minutly xamining various rligious, philosophic, and political
doctrins as causs of vnts, as soon as thy hav to dscrib an
actual historic vnt such as th campaign of 1812 for instanc, thy
involuntarily dscrib it as rsulting from an xrcis of powr—and say
plainly that that was th rsult of Napolon’s will. Spaking so, th
historians of cultur involuntarily contradict thmslvs, and show that
th nw forc thy hav dvisd dos not account for what happns in
history, and that history can only b xplaind by introducing a powr
which thy apparntly do not rcogniz.
CHAPTR III
A locomotiv is moving. Somon asks: “What movs it?” A pasant says
th dvil movs it. Anothr man says th locomotiv movs bcaus its
whls go round. A third assrts that th caus of its movmnt lis in
th smok which th wind carris away.
Th pasant is irrfutabl. H has dvisd a complt xplanation. To
rfut him somon would hav to prov to him that thr is no dvil,
or anothr pasant would hav to xplain to him that it is not th dvil
but a Grman, who movs th locomotiv. Only thn, as a rsult of th
contradiction, will thy s that thy ar both wrong. But th man who
says that th movmnt of th whls is th caus rfuts himslf, for
having onc bgun to analyz h ought to go on and xplain furthr why
th whls go round; and till h has rachd th ultimat caus of th
movmnt of th locomotiv in th prssur of stam in th boilr, h
has no right to stop in his sarch for th caus. Th man who xplains
th movmnt of th locomotiv by th smok that is carrid back has
noticd that th whls do not supply an xplanation and has takn th
first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offrd that as an
xplanation.
Th only concption that can xplain th movmnt of th locomotiv is
that of a forc commnsurat with th movmnt obsrvd.
Th only concption that can xplain th movmnt of th popls is that
of som forc commnsurat with th whol movmnt of th popls.
Yt to supply this concption various historians tak forcs of
diffrnt kinds, all of which ar incommnsurat with th movmnt
obsrvd. Som s it as a forc dirctly inhrnt in hros, as th
pasant ss th dvil in th locomotiv; othrs as a forc rsulting
from svral othr forcs, lik th movmnt of th whls; othrs again
as an intllctual influnc, lik th smok that is blown away.
So long as historis ar writtn of sparat individuals, whthr
Casars, Alxandrs, Luthrs, or Voltairs, and not th historis
of all, absolutly all thos who tak part in an vnt, it is quit
impossibl to dscrib th movmnt of humanity without th concption
of a forc complling mn to dirct thir activity toward a crtain nd.
And th only such concption known to historians is that of powr.
This concption is th on handl by mans of which th matrial of
history, as at prsnt xpoundd, can b dalt with, and anyon who
braks that handl off, as Buckl did, without finding som othr mthod
of trating historical matrial, mrly dprivs himslf of th on
possibl way of daling with it. Th ncssity of th concption of
powr as an xplanation of historical vnts is bst dmonstratd by
th univrsal historians and historians of cultur thmslvs, for thy
profssdly rjct that concption but invitably hav rcours to it at
vry stp.
In daling with humanity’s inquiry, th scinc of history up to now
is lik mony in circulation—papr mony and coin. Th biographis and
spcial national historis ar lik papr mony. Thy can b usd and
can circulat and fulfill thir purpos without harm to anyon and vn
advantagously, as long as no on asks what is th scurity bhind thm.
You nd only forgt to ask how th will of hros producs vnts, and
such historis as Thirs’ will b intrsting and instructiv and may
prhaps vn possss a ting of potry. But just as doubts of th ral
valu of papr mony aris ithr bcaus, bing asy to mak, too much
of it gts mad or bcaus popl try to xchang it for gold, so also
doubts concrning th ral valu of such historis aris ithr bcaus
too many of thm ar writtn or bcaus in his simplicity of hart
somon inquirs: by what forc did Napolon do this?—that is, wants
to xchang th currnt papr mony for th ral gold of actual
comprhnsion.
Th writrs of univrsal historis and of th history of cultur ar
lik popl who, rcognizing th dfcts of papr mony, dcid to
substitut for it mony mad of mtal that has not th spcific gravity
of gold. It may indd mak jingling coin, but will do no mor than
that. Papr mony may dciv th ignorant, but nobody is dcivd by
tokns of bas mtal that hav no valu but mrly jingl. As gold is
gold only if it is srvicabl not mrly for xchang but also for us,
so univrsal historians will b valuabl only whn thy can rply to
history’s ssntial qustion: what is powr? Th univrsal historians
giv contradictory rplis to that qustion, whil th historians of
cultur vad it and answr somthing quit diffrnt. And as countrs
of imitation gold can b usd only among a group of popl who agr to
accpt thm as gold, or among thos who do not know th natur of
gold, so univrsal historians and historians of cultur, not answring
humanity’s ssntial qustion, srv as currncy for som purposs of
thir own, only in univrsitis and among th mass of radrs who hav a
tast for what thy call “srious rading.”
CHAPTR IV
Having abandond th concption of th ancints as to th divin
subjction of th will of a nation to som chosn man and th subjction
of that man’s will to th Dity, history cannot without contradictions
tak a singl stp till it has chosn on of two things: ithr a rturn
to th formr blif in th dirct intrvntion of th Dity in human
affairs or a dfinit xplanation of th maning of th forc producing
historical vnts and trmd “powr.”
A rturn to th first is impossibl, th blif has bn dstroyd; and
so it is ssntial to xplain what is mant by powr.
Napolon ordrd an army to b raisd and go to war. W ar so
accustomd to that ida and hav bcom so usd to it that th qustion:
why did six hundrd thousand mn go to fight whn Napolon uttrd
crtain words, sms to us snslss. H had th powr and so what h
ordrd was don.
This rply is quit satisfactory if w bliv that th powr was givn
him by God. But as soon as w do not admit that, it bcoms ssntial to
dtrmin what is this powr of on man ovr othrs.
It cannot b th dirct physical powr of a strong man ovr a wak on—a
domination basd on th application or thrat of physical forc, lik
th powr of Hrculs; nor can it b basd on th ffct of moral forc,
as in thir simplicity som historians think who say that th lading
figurs in history ar hros, that is, mn giftd with a spcial
strngth of soul and mind calld gnius. This powr cannot b basd on
th prdominanc of moral strngth, for, not to mntion hros such as
Napolon about whos moral qualitis opinions diffr widly, history
shows us that nithr a Louis XI nor a Mttrnich, who ruld ovr
millions of popl, had any particular moral qualitis, but on th
contrary wr gnrally morally wakr than any of th millions thy
ruld ovr.
If th sourc of powr lis nithr in th physical nor in th moral
qualitis of him who posssss it, it must vidntly b lookd for
lswhr—in th rlation to th popl of th man who wilds th powr.
And that is how powr is undrstood by th scinc of jurisprudnc,
that xchang bank of history which offrs to xchang history’s
undrstanding of powr for tru gold.
Powr is th collctiv will of th popl transfrrd, by xprssd or
tacit consnt, to thir chosn rulrs.
In th domain of jurisprudnc, which consists of discussions of how a
stat and powr might b arrangd wr it possibl for all that to
b arrangd, it is all vry clar; but whn applid to history that
dfinition of powr nds xplanation.
Th scinc of jurisprudnc rgards th stat and powr as th ancints
rgardd fir—namly, as somthing xisting absolutly. But for history,
th stat and powr ar mrly phnomna, just as for modrn physics
fir is not an lmnt but a phnomnon.
From this fundamntal diffrnc btwn th viw hld by history and
that hld by jurisprudnc, it follows that jurisprudnc can tll
minutly how in its opinion powr should b constitutd and what
powr—xisting immutably outsid tim—is, but to history’s qustions
about th maning of th mutations of powr in tim it can answr
nothing.
If powr b th collctiv will of th popl transfrrd to thir
rulr, was Pugachëv a rprsntativ of th will of th popl? If not,
thn why was Napolon I? Why was Napolon III a criminal whn h was
takn prisonr at Boulogn, and why, latr on, wr thos criminals whom
h arrstd?
Do palac rvolutions—in which somtims only two or thr popl tak
part—transfr th will of th popl to a nw rulr? In intrnational
rlations, is th will of th popl also transfrrd to thir
conquror? Was th will of th Confdration of th Rhin transfrrd
to Napolon in 1806? Was th will of th Russian popl transfrrd
to Napolon in 1809, whn our army in allianc with th Frnch wnt to
fight th Austrians?
To ths qustions thr answrs ar possibl:
ithr to assum (1) that th will of th popl is always
unconditionally transfrrd to th rulr or rulrs thy hav chosn, and
that thrfor vry mrgnc of a nw powr, vry struggl
against th powr onc appointd, should b absolutly rgardd as an
infringmnt of th ral powr; or (2) that th will of th popl
is transfrrd to th rulrs conditionally, undr dfinit and known
conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and vn
dstructions of powr rsult from a nonobsrvanc by th rulrs of th
conditions undr which thir powr was ntrustd to thm; or (3) that
th will of th popl is dlgatd to th rulrs conditionally, but
that th conditions ar unknown and indfinit, and that th apparanc
of svral authoritis, thir struggls and thir falls, rsult solly
from th gratr or lssr fulfillmnt by th rulrs of ths unknown
conditions on which th will of th popl is transfrrd from som
popl to othrs.
And ths ar th thr ways in which th historians do xplain th
rlation of th popl to thir rulrs.
Som historians—thos biographical and spcialist historians alrady
rfrrd to—in thir simplicity failing to undrstand th qustion of
th maning of powr, sm to considr that th collctiv will of
th popl is unconditionally transfrrd to historical prsons, and
thrfor whn dscribing som singl stat thy assum that particular
powr to b th on absolut and ral powr, and that any othr forc
opposing this is not a powr but a violation of powr—mr violnc.
Thir thory, suitabl for primitiv and pacful priods of history,
has th inconvninc—in application to complx and stormy priods in
th lif of nations during which various powrs aris simultanously and
struggl with on anothr—that a Lgitimist historian will prov
that th National Convntion, th Dirctory, and Bonapart wr mr
infringrs of th tru powr, whil a Rpublican and a Bonapartist will
prov: th on that th Convntion and th othr that th mpir was th
ral powr, and that all th othrs wr violations of powr.
vidntly th xplanations furnishd by ths historians bing mutually
contradictory can only satisfy young childrn.
Rcognizing th falsity of this viw of history, anothr st of
historians say that powr rsts on a conditional dlgation of th will
of th popl to thir rulrs, and that historical ladrs hav powr
only conditionally on carrying out th program that th will of th
popl has by tacit agrmnt prscribd to thm. But what this program
consists in ths historians do not say, or if thy do thy continually
contradict on anothr.
ach historian, according to his viw of what constituts a nation’s
progrss, looks for ths conditions in th gratnss, walth, frdom,
or nlightnmnt of citizns of Franc or som othr country. But not
to mntion th historians’ contradictions as to th natur of this
program—or vn admitting that som on gnral program of ths
conditions xists—th facts of history almost always contradict that
thory. If th conditions undr which powr is ntrustd consist in th
walth, frdom, and nlightnmnt of th popl, how is it that Louis
XIV and Iván th Trribl nd thir rigns tranquilly, whil Louis XVI
and Charls I ar xcutd by thir popl? To this qustion historians
rply that Louis XIV’s activity, contrary to th program, ractd on
Louis XVI. But why did it not ract on Louis XIV or on Louis XV—why
should it ract just on Louis XVI? And what is th tim limit for such
ractions? To ths qustions thr ar and can b no answrs. qually
littl dos this viw xplain why for svral cnturis th collctiv
will is not withdrawn from crtain rulrs and thir hirs, and
thn suddnly during a priod of fifty yars is transfrrd to th
Convntion, to th Dirctory, to Napolon, to Alxandr, to Louis XVIII,
to Napolon again, to Charls X, to Louis Philipp, to a Rpublican
govrnmnt, and to Napolon III. Whn xplaining ths rapid transfrs
of th popl’s will from on individual to anothr, spcially in viw
of intrnational rlations, conqusts, and alliancs, th historians ar
obligd to admit that som of ths transfrs ar not normal dlgations
of th popl’s will but ar accidnts dpndnt on cunning, on
mistaks, on craft, or on th waknss of a diplomatist, a rulr, or a
party ladr. So that th gratr part of th vnts of history—civil
wars, rvolutions, and conqusts—ar prsntd by ths historians
not as th rsults of fr transfrncs of th popl’s will, but as
rsults of th ill-dirctd will of on or mor individuals, that is,
onc again, as usurpations of powr. And so ths historians also s
and admit historical vnts which ar xcptions to th thory.
Ths historians rsmbl a botanist who, having noticd that som
plants grow from sds producing two cotyldons, should insist that all
that grows dos so by sprouting into two lavs, and that th palm, th
mushroom, and vn th oak, which blossom into full growth and no longr
rsmbl two lavs, ar dviations from th thory.
Historians of th third class assum that th will of th popl
is transfrrd to historic prsonags conditionally, but that th
conditions ar unknown to us. Thy say that historical prsonags hav
powr only bcaus thy fulfill th will of th popl which has bn
dlgatd to thm.
But in that cas, if th forc that movs nations lis not in th
historic ladrs but in th nations thmslvs, what significanc hav
thos ladrs?
Th ladrs, ths historians tll us, xprss th will of th popl:
th activity of th ladrs rprsnts th activity of th popl.
But in that cas th qustion ariss whthr all th activity of th
ladrs srvs as an xprssion of th popl’s will or only som part
of it. If th whol activity of th ladrs srvs as th xprssion of
th popl’s will, as som historians suppos, thn all th dtails
of th court scandals containd in th biographis of a Napolon or
a Cathrin srv to xprss th lif of th nation, which is vidnt
nonsns; but if it is only som particular sid of th activity of an
historical ladr which srvs to xprss th popl’s lif, as othr
so-calld “philosophical” historians bliv, thn to dtrmin which
sid of th activity of a ladr xprsss th nation’s lif, w hav
first of all to know in what th nation’s lif consists.
Mt by this difficulty historians of that class dvis som most
obscur, impalpabl, and gnral abstraction which can covr all
concivabl occurrncs, and dclar this abstraction to b th aim of
humanity’s movmnt. Th most usual gnralizations adoptd by almost
all th historians ar: frdom, quality, nlightnmnt, progrss,
civilization, and cultur. Postulating som gnralization as th goal
of th movmnt of humanity, th historians study th mn of whom th
gratst numbr of monumnts hav rmaind: kings, ministrs, gnrals,
authors, rformrs, pops, and journalists, to th xtnt to which in
thir opinion ths prsons hav promotd or hindrd that abstraction.
But as it is in no way provd that th aim of humanity dos consist in
frdom, quality, nlightnmnt, or civilization, and as th connction
of th popl with th rulrs and nlightnrs of humanity is only basd
on th arbitrary assumption that th collctiv will of th popl is
always transfrrd to th mn whom w hav noticd, it happns that th
activity of th millions who migrat, burn houss, abandon agricultur,
and dstroy on anothr nvr is xprssd in th account of th
activity of som dozn popl who did not burn houss, practic
agricultur, or slay thir fllow craturs.
History provs this at vry turn. Is th frmnt of th popls of
th wst at th nd of th ightnth cntury and thir driv astward
xplaind by th activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, thir mistrsss
and ministrs, and by th livs of Napolon, Roussau, Didrot,
Baumarchais, and othrs?
Is th movmnt of th Russian popl astward to Kazán and Sibria
xprssd by dtails of th morbid charactr of Iván th Trribl and by
his corrspondnc with Kúrbski?
Is th movmnt of th popls at th tim of th Crusads xplaind by
th lif and activity of th Godfrys and th Louis-s and thir ladis?
For us that movmnt of th popls from wst to ast, without
ladrs, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Ptr th Hrmit, rmains
incomprhnsibl. And yt mor incomprhnsibl is th cssation of that
movmnt whn a rational and sacrd aim for th Crusad—th dlivranc
of Jrusalm—had bn clarly dfind by historic ladrs. Pops, kings,
and knights incitd th popls to fr th Holy Land; but th popl
did not go, for th unknown caus which had prviously implld thm to
go no longr xistd. Th history of th Godfrys and th Minnsingrs
can vidntly not covr th lif of th popls. And th history of th
Godfrys and th Minnsingrs has rmaind th history of Godfrys
and Minnsingrs, but th history of th lif of th popls and thir
impulss has rmaind unknown.
Still lss dos th history of authors and rformrs xplain to us th
lif of th popls.
Th history of cultur xplains to us th impulss and conditions of
lif and thought of a writr or a rformr. W larn that Luthr had
a hot tmpr and said such and such things; w larn that Roussau was
suspicious and wrot such and such books; but w do not larn why aftr
th Rformation th popls massacrd on anothr, nor why during th
Frnch Rvolution thy guillotind on anothr.
If w unit both ths kinds of history, as is don by th nwst
historians, w shall hav th history of monarchs and writrs, but not
th history of th lif of th popls.
CHAPTR V
Th lif of th nations is not containd in th livs of a fw mn, for
th connction btwn thos mn and th nations has not bn found.
Th thory that this connction is basd on th transfrnc of th
collctiv will of a popl to crtain historical prsonags is an
hypothsis unconfirmd by th xprinc of history.
Th thory of th transfrnc of th collctiv will of th popl to
historic prsons may prhaps xplain much in th domain of jurisprudnc
and b ssntial for its purposs, but in its application to history, as
soon as rvolutions, conqusts, or civil wars occur—that is, as soon as
history bgins—that thory xplains nothing.
Th thory sms irrfutabl just bcaus th act of transfrnc of th
popl’s will cannot b vrifid, for it nvr occurrd.
Whatvr happns and whovr may stand at th had of affairs, th
thory can always say that such and such a prson took th lad bcaus
th collctiv will was transfrrd to him.
Th rplis this thory givs to historical qustions ar lik th
rplis of a man who, watching th movmnts of a hrd of cattl and
paying no attntion to th varying quality of th pasturag in diffrnt
parts of th fild, or to th driving of th hrdsman, should attribut
th dirction th hrd taks to what animal happns to b at its had.
“Th hrd gos in that dirction bcaus th animal in front lads
it and th collctiv will of all th othr animals is vstd in that
ladr.” This is what historians of th first class say—thos who assum
th unconditional transfrnc of th popl’s will.
“If th animals lading th hrd chang, this happns bcaus th
collctiv will of all th animals is transfrrd from on ladr to
anothr, according to whthr th animal is or is not lading thm in
th dirction slctd by th whol hrd.” Such is th rply historians
who assum that th collctiv will of th popl is dlgatd to
rulrs undr conditions which thy rgard as known. (With this mthod
of obsrvation it oftn happns that th obsrvr, influncd by th
dirction h himslf prfrs, rgards thos as ladrs who, owing to th
popl’s chang of dirction, ar no longr in front, but on on sid,
or vn in th rar.)
“If th animals in front ar continually changing and th dirction of
th whol hrd is constantly altrd, this is bcaus in ordr to follow
a givn dirction th animals transfr thir will to th animals that
hav attractd our attntion, and to study th movmnts of th hrd
w must watch th movmnts of all th prominnt animals moving on all
sids of th hrd.” So say th third class of historians who rgard all
historical prsons, from monarchs to journalists, as th xprssion of
thir ag.
Th thory of th transfrnc of th will of th popl to historic
prsons is mrly a paraphras—a rstatmnt of th qustion in othr
words.
What causs historical vnts? Powr. What is powr? Powr is th
collctiv will of th popl transfrrd to on prson. Undr what
condition is th will of th popl dlgatd to on prson? On
condition that that prson xprsss th will of th whol popl. That
is, powr is powr: in othr words, powr is a word th maning of which
w do not undrstand.
If th ralm of human knowldg wr confind to abstract rasoning,
thn having subjctd to criticism th xplanation of “powr” that
juridical scinc givs us, humanity would conclud that powr is mrly
a word and has no ral xistnc. But to undrstand phnomna man
has, bsids abstract rasoning, xprinc by which h vrifis his
rflctions. And xprinc tlls us that powr is not mrly a word but
an actually xisting phnomnon.
Not to spak of th fact that no dscription of th collctiv activity
of mn can do without th concption of powr, th xistnc of powr is
provd both by history and by obsrving contmporary vnts.
Whnvr an vnt occurs a man appars or mn appar, by whos will th
vnt sms to hav takn plac. Napolon III issus a dcr and th
Frnch go to Mxico. Th King of Prussia and Bismarck issu dcrs and
an army ntrs Bohmia. Napolon I issus a dcr and an army ntrs
Russia. Alxandr I givs a command and th Frnch submit to th
Bourbons. xprinc shows us that whatvr vnt occurs it is always
rlatd to th will of on or of svral mn who hav dcrd it.
Th historians, in accord with th old habit of acknowldging divin
intrvntion in human affairs, want to s th caus of vnts in
th xprssion of th will of somon ndowd with powr, but that
supposition is not confirmd ithr by rason or by xprinc.
On th on sid rflction shows that th xprssion of a man’s will—his
words—ar only part of th gnral activity xprssd in an vnt,
as for instanc in a war or a rvolution, and so without assuming an
incomprhnsibl, suprnatural forc—a miracl—on cannot admit that
words can b th immdiat caus of th movmnts of millions of mn.
On th othr hand, vn if w admittd that words could b th caus
of vnts, history shows that th xprssion of th will of historical
prsonags dos not in most cass produc any ffct, that is to say,
thir commands ar oftn not xcutd, and somtims th vry opposit
of what thy ordr occurs.
Without admitting divin intrvntion in th affairs of humanity w
cannot rgard “powr” as th caus of vnts.
Powr, from th standpoint of xprinc, is mrly th rlation that
xists btwn th xprssion of somon’s will and th xcution of
that will by othrs.
To xplain th conditions of that rlationship w must first stablish a
concption of th xprssion of will, rfrring it to man and not to th
Dity.
If th Dity issus a command, xprsss His will, as ancint history
tlls us, th xprssion of that will is indpndnt of tim and is not
causd by anything, for th Divinity is not controlld by an vnt. But
spaking of commands that ar th xprssion of th will of mn acting
in tim and in rlation to on anothr, to xplain th connction of
commands with vnts w must rstor: (1) th condition of all that
taks plac: th continuity of movmnt in tim both of th vnts and
of th prson who commands, and (2) th invitability of th connction
btwn th prson commanding and thos who xcut his command.
CHAPTR VI
Only th xprssion of th will of th Dity, not dpndnt on tim, can
rlat to a whol sris of vnts occurring ovr a priod of yars or
cnturis, and only th Dity, indpndnt of vrything, can by His
sol will dtrmin th dirction of humanity’s movmnt; but man acts
in tim and himslf taks part in what occurs.
Rinstating th first condition omittd, that of tim, w s that no
command can b xcutd without som prcding ordr having bn givn
rndring th xcution of th last command possibl.
No command vr appars spontanously, or itslf covrs a whol sris
of occurrncs; but ach command follows from anothr, and nvr rfrs
to a whol sris of vnts but always to on momnt only of an vnt.
Whn, for instanc, w say that Napolon ordrd armis to go to war,
w combin in on simultanous xprssion a whol sris of conscutiv
commands dpndnt on on anothr. Napolon could not hav commandd
an invasion of Russia and nvr did so. Today h ordrd such and such
paprs to b writtn to Vinna, to Brlin, and to Ptrsburg;
tomorrow such and such dcrs and ordrs to th army, th flt, th
commissariat, and so on and so on—millions of commands, which formd
a whol sris corrsponding to a sris of vnts which brought th
Frnch armis into Russia.
If throughout his rign Napolon gav commands concrning an invasion
of ngland and xpndd on no othr undrtaking so much tim and ffort,
and yt during his whol rign nvr onc attmptd to xcut that
dsign but undrtook an xpdition into Russia, with which country h
considrd it dsirabl to b in allianc (a conviction h rpatdly
xprssd)—this cam about bcaus his commands did not corrspond to
th cours of vnts in th first cas, but did so corrspond in th
lattr.
For an ordr to b crtainly xcutd, it is ncssary that a man should
ordr what can b xcutd. But to know what can and what cannot b
xcutd is impossibl, not only in th cas of Napolon’s invasion of
Russia in which millions participatd, but vn in th simplst vnt,
for in ithr cas millions of obstacls may aris to prvnt its
xcution. vry ordr xcutd is always on of an immns numbr
unxcutd. All th impossibl ordrs inconsistnt with th cours of
vnts rmain unxcutd. Only th possibl ons gt linkd up with a
conscutiv sris of commands corrsponding to a sris of vnts, and
ar xcutd.
Our fals concption that an vnt is causd by a command which prcds
it is du to th fact that whn th vnt has takn plac and out of
thousands of othrs thos fw commands which wr consistnt with that
vnt hav bn xcutd, w forgt about th othrs that wr not
xcutd bcaus thy could not b. Apart from that, th chif sourc
of our rror in this mattr is du to th fact that in th historical
accounts a whol sris of innumrabl, divrs, and ptty vnts, such
for instanc as all thos which ld th Frnch armis to Russia, is
gnralizd into on vnt in accord with th rsult producd by that
sris of vnts, and corrsponding with this gnralization th whol
sris of commands is also gnralizd into a singl xprssion of will.
W say that Napolon wishd to invad Russia and invadd it. In
rality in all Napolon’s activity w nvr find anything rsmbling an
xprssion of that wish, but find a sris of ordrs, or xprssions of
his will, vry variously and indfinitly dirctd. Amid a long sris
of unxcutd ordrs of Napolon’s on sris, for th campaign of 1812,
was carrid out—not bcaus thos ordrs diffrd in any way from th
othr, unxcutd ordrs but bcaus thy coincidd with th cours of
vnts that ld th Frnch army into Russia; just as in stncil work
this or that figur coms out not bcaus th color was laid on from
this sid or in that way, but bcaus it was laid on from all sids ovr
th figur cut in th stncil.
So that xamining th rlation in tim of th commands to th vnts,
w find that a command can nvr b th caus of th vnt, but that a
crtain dfinit dpndnc xists btwn th two.
To undrstand in what this dpndnc consists it is ncssary to
rinstat anothr omittd condition of vry command procding not from
th Dity but from a man, which is, that th man who givs th command
himslf taks part in th vnt.
This rlation of th commandr to thos h commands is just what is
calld powr. This rlation consists in th following:
For common action popl always unit in crtain combinations, in which
rgardlss of th diffrnc of th aims st for th common action, th
rlation btwn thos taking part in it is always th sam.
Mn uniting in ths combinations always assum such rlations toward
on anothr that th largr numbr tak a mor dirct shar, and th
smallr numbr a lss dirct shar, in th collctiv action for which
thy hav combind.
Of all th combinations in which mn unit for collctiv action on of
th most striking and dfinit xampls is an army.
vry army is composd of lowr grads of th srvic—th rank and
fil—of whom thr ar always th gratst numbr; of th nxt highr
military rank—corporals and noncommissiond officrs of whom thr ar
fwr, and of still-highr officrs of whom thr ar still fwr,
and so on to th highst military command which is concntratd in on
prson.
A military organization may b quit corrctly compard to a con, of
which th bas with th largst diamtr consists of th rank and fil;
th nxt highr and smallr sction of th con consists of th nxt
highr grads of th army, and so on to th apx, th point of which
will rprsnt th commandr in chif.
Th soldirs, of whom thr ar th most, form th lowr sction of
th con and its bas. Th soldir himslf dos th stabbing, hacking,
burning, and pillaging, and always rcivs ordrs for ths actions
from mn abov him; h himslf nvr givs an ordr. Th noncommissiond
officrs (of whom thr ar fwr) prform th action itslf lss
frquntly than th soldirs, but thy alrady giv commands. An
officr still lss oftn acts dirctly himslf, but commands still mor
frquntly. A gnral dos nothing but command th troops, indicats th
objctiv, and hardly vr uss a wapon himslf. Th commandr in chif
nvr taks dirct part in th action itslf, but only givs gnral
ordrs concrning th movmnt of th mass of th troops. A similar
rlation of popl to on anothr is sn in vry combination of mn
for common activity—in agricultur, trad, and vry administration.
And so without particularly analyzing all th contiguous sctions of
a con and of th ranks of an army, or th ranks and positions in
any administrativ or public businss whatvr from th lowst to th
highst, w s a law by which mn, to tak associatd action, combin
in such rlations that th mor dirctly thy participat in prforming
th action th lss thy can command and th mor numrous thy ar,
whil th lss thir dirct participation in th action itslf, th mor
thy command and th fwr of thm thr ar; rising in this way from
th lowst ranks to th man at th top, who taks th last dirct shar
in th action and dircts his activity chifly to commanding.
This rlation of th mn who command to thos thy command is what
constituts th ssnc of th concption calld powr.
Having rstord th condition of tim undr which all vnts occur,
w find that a command is xcutd only whn it is rlatd to a
corrsponding sris of vnts. Rstoring th ssntial condition of
rlation btwn thos who command and thos who xcut, w find that
by th vry natur of th cas thos who command tak th smallst part
in th action itslf and that thir activity is xclusivly dirctd to
commanding.
CHAPTR VII
Whn an vnt is taking plac popl xprss thir opinions and wishs
about it, and as th vnt rsults from th collctiv activity of
many popl, som on of th opinions or wishs xprssd is sur to b
fulfilld if but approximatly. Whn on of th opinions xprssd
is fulfilld, that opinion gts connctd with th vnt as a command
prcding it.
Mn ar hauling a log. ach of thm xprsss his opinion as to how and
whr to haul it. Thy haul th log away, and it happns that this is
don as on of thm said. H ordrd it. Thr w hav command and powr
in thir primary form. Th man who workd most with his hands could not
think so much about what h was doing, or rflct on or command what
would rsult from th common activity; whil th man who commandd
mor would vidntly work lss with his hands on account of his gratr
vrbal activity.
Whn som largr concours of mn dirct thir activity to a common aim
thr is a yt sharpr division of thos who, bcaus thir activity is
givn to dircting and commanding, tak lss part in th dirct work.
Whn a man works alon h always has a crtain st of rflctions which
as it sms to him dirctd his past activity, justify his prsnt
activity, and guid him in planning his futur actions. Just th sam is
don by a concours of popl, allowing thos who do not tak a dirct
part in th activity to dvis considrations, justifications, and
surmiss concrning thir collctiv activity.
For rasons known or unknown to us th Frnch bgan to drown and kill
on anothr. And corrsponding to th vnt its justification appars in
popl’s blif that this was ncssary for th wlfar of Franc, for
librty, and for quality. Popl casd to kill on anothr, and
this vnt was accompanid by its justification in th ncssity for a
cntralization of powr, rsistanc to urop, and so on. Mn wnt
from th wst to th ast killing thir fllow mn, and th vnt
was accompanid by phrass about th glory of Franc, th basnss of
ngland, and so on. History shows us that ths justifications of th
vnts hav no common sns and ar all contradictory, as in th cas of
killing a man as th rsult of rcognizing his rights, and th killing
of millions in Russia for th humiliation of ngland. But ths
justifications hav a vry ncssary significanc in thir own day.
Ths justifications rlas thos who produc th vnts from moral
rsponsibility. Ths tmporary aims ar lik th broom fixd in front
of a locomotiv to clar th snow from th rails in front: thy clar
mn’s moral rsponsibilitis from thir path.
Without such justification thr would b no rply to th simplst
qustion that prsnts itslf whn xamining ach historical vnt. How
is it that millions of mn commit collctiv crims—mak war, commit
murdr, and so on?
With th prsnt complx forms of political and social lif in urop
can any vnt that is not prscribd, dcrd, or ordrd by monarchs,
ministrs, parliamnts, or nwspaprs b imagind? Is thr any
collctiv action which cannot find its justification in political
unity, in patriotism, in th balanc of powr, or in civilization? So
that vry vnt that occurs invitably coincids with som xprssd
wish and, rciving a justification, prsnts itslf as th rsult of
th will of on man or of svral mn.
In whatvr dirction a ship movs, th flow of th wavs it cuts
will always b noticabl ahad of it. To thos on board th ship th
movmnt of thos wavs will b th only prcptibl motion.
Only by watching closly momnt by momnt th movmnt of that flow and
comparing it with th movmnt of th ship do w convinc ourslvs that
vry bit of it is occasiond by th forward movmnt of th ship,
and that w wr ld into rror by th fact that w ourslvs wr
imprcptibly moving.
W s th sam if w watch momnt by momnt th movmnt of historical
charactrs (that is, r-stablish th invitabl condition of all that
occurs—th continuity of movmnt in tim) and do not los sight of th
ssntial connction of historical prsons with th masss.
Whn th ship movs in on dirction thr is on and th sam wav
ahad of it, whn it turns frquntly th wav ahad of it also turns
frquntly. But whrvr it may turn thr always will b th wav
anticipating its movmnt.
Whatvr happns it always appars that just that vnt was forsn
and dcrd. Whrvr th ship may go, th rush of watr which nithr
dircts nor incrass its movmnt foams ahad of it, and at a distanc
sms to us not mrly to mov of itslf but to govrn th ship’s
movmnt also.
xamining only thos xprssions of th will of historical prsons
which, as commands, wr rlatd to vnts, historians hav assumd
that th vnts dpndd on thos commands. But xamining th vnts
thmslvs and th connction in which th historical prsons stood to
th popl, w hav found that thy and thir ordrs wr dpndnt on
vnts. Th incontstabl proof of this dduction is that, howvr many
commands wr issud, th vnt dos not tak plac unlss thr ar
othr causs for it, but as soon as an vnt occurs—b it what it
may—thn out of all th continually xprssd wishs of diffrnt popl
som will always b found which by thir maning and thir tim of
uttranc ar rlatd as commands to th vnts.
Arriving at this conclusion w can rply dirctly and positivly to
ths two ssntial qustions of history:
(1) What is powr?
(2) What forc producs th movmnt of th nations?
(1) Powr is th rlation of a givn prson to othr individuals,
in which th mor this prson xprsss opinions, prdictions, and
justifications of th collctiv action that is prformd, th lss is
his participation in that action.
(2) Th movmnt of nations is causd not by powr, nor by intllctual
activity, nor vn by a combination of th two as historians hav
supposd, but by th activity of all th popl who participat in
th vnts, and who always combin in such a way that thos taking
th largst dirct shar in th vnt tak on thmslvs th last
rsponsibility and vic vrsa.
Morally th wildr of powr appars to caus th vnt; physically
it is thos who submit to th powr. But as th moral activity is
inconcivabl without th physical, th caus of th vnt is nithr in
th on nor in th othr but in th union of th two.
Or in othr words, th concption of a caus is inapplicabl to th
phnomna w ar xamining.
In th last analysis w rach th circl of infinity—that final limit
to which in vry domain of thought man’s rason arrivs if it is not
playing with th subjct. lctricity producs hat, hat producs
lctricity. Atoms attract ach othr and atoms rpl on anothr.
Spaking of th intraction of hat and lctricity and of atoms, w
cannot say why this occurs, and w say that it is so bcaus it is
inconcivabl othrwis, bcaus it must b so and that it is a law. Th
sam applis to historical vnts. Why war and rvolution occur w do
not know. W only know that to produc th on or th othr action,
popl combin in a crtain formation in which thy all tak part, and
w say that this is so bcaus it is unthinkabl othrwis, or in othr
words that it is a law.
CHAPTR VIII
If history dalt only with xtrnal phnomna, th stablishmnt of this
simpl and obvious law would suffic and w should hav finishd our
argumnt. But th law of history rlats to man. A particl of mattr
cannot tll us that it dos not fl th law of attraction or rpulsion
and that that law is untru, but man, who is th subjct of history,
says plainly: I am fr and am thrfor not subjct to th law.
Th prsnc of th problm of man’s fr will, though unxprssd, is
flt at vry stp of history.
All sriously thinking historians hav involuntarily ncountrd this
qustion. All th contradictions and obscuritis of history and th
fals path historical scinc has followd ar du solly to th lack of
a solution of that qustion.
If th will of vry man wr fr, that is, if ach man could act as h
plasd, all history would b a sris of disconnctd incidnts.
If in a thousand yars vn on man in a million could act frly, that
is, as h chos, it is vidnt that on singl fr act of that man’s
in violation of th laws govrning human action would dstroy th
possibility of th xistnc of any laws for th whol of humanity.
If thr b a singl law govrning th actions of mn, fr will cannot
xist, for thn man’s will is subjct to that law.
In this contradiction lis th problm of fr will, which from most
ancint tims has occupid th bst human minds and from most ancint
tims has bn prsntd in its whol trmndous significanc.
Th problm is that rgarding man as a subjct of obsrvation
from whatvr point of viw—thological, historical, thical, or
philosophic—w find a gnral law of ncssity to which h (lik all
that xists) is subjct. But rgarding him from within ourslvs as what
w ar conscious of, w fl ourslvs to b fr.
This consciousnss is a sourc of slf-cognition quit apart from and
indpndnt of rason. Through his rason man obsrvs himslf, but only
through consciousnss dos h know himslf.
Apart from consciousnss of slf no obsrvation or application of rason
is concivabl.
To undrstand, obsrv, and draw conclusions, man must first of all b
conscious of himslf as living. A man is only conscious of himslf as
a living bing by th fact that h wills, that is, is conscious of
his volition. But his will—which forms th ssnc of his lif—man
rcognizs (and can but rcogniz) as fr.
If, obsrving himslf, man ss that his will is always dirctd by
on and th sam law (whthr h obsrvs th ncssity of taking
food, using his brain, or anything ls) h cannot rcogniz this
nvr-varying dirction of his will othrwis than as a limitation of
it. Wr it not fr it could not b limitd. A man’s will sms to him
to b limitd just bcaus h is not conscious of it xcpt as fr.
You say: I am not fr. But I hav liftd my hand and lt it fall.
vryon undrstands that this illogical rply is an irrfutabl
dmonstration of frdom.
That rply is th xprssion of a consciousnss that is not subjct to
rason.
If th consciousnss of frdom wr not a sparat and indpndnt
sourc of slf-consciousnss it would b subjct to rasoning and
to xprinc, but in fact such subjction dos not xist and is
inconcivabl.
A sris of xprimnts and argumnts provs to vry man that h, as
an objct of obsrvation, is subjct to crtain laws, and man submits to
thm and nvr rsists th laws of gravity or imprmability onc h
has bcom acquaintd with thm. But th sam sris of xprimnts
and argumnts provs to him that th complt frdom of which h is
conscious in himslf is impossibl, and that his vry action dpnds
on his organization, his charactr, and th motivs acting upon him; yt
man nvr submits to th dductions of ths xprimnts and argumnts.
Having larnd from xprimnt and argumnt that a ston falls
downwards, a man indubitably blivs this and always xpcts th law
that h has larnd to b fulfilld.
But larning just as crtainly that his will is subjct to laws, h dos
not and cannot bliv this.
Howvr oftn xprimnt and rasoning may show a man that undr th
sam conditions and with th sam charactr h will do th sam thing as
bfor, yt whn undr th sam conditions and with th sam charactr
h approachs for th thousandth tim th action that always nds in th
sam way, h fls as crtainly convincd as bfor th xprimnt
that h can act as h plass. vry man, savag or sag, howvr
incontstably rason and xprimnt may prov to him that it is
impossibl to imagin two diffrnt courss of action in prcisly th
sam conditions, fls that without this irrational concption (which
constituts th ssnc of frdom) h cannot imagin lif. H fls
that howvr impossibl it may b, it is so, for without this concption
of frdom not only would h b unabl to undrstand lif, but h would
b unabl to liv for a singl momnt.
H could not liv, bcaus all man’s fforts, all his impulss to lif,
ar only fforts to incras frdom. Walth and povrty, fam and
obscurity, powr and subordination, strngth and waknss, halth and
disas, cultur and ignoranc, work and lisur, rpltion and hungr,
virtu and vic, ar only gratr or lssr dgrs of frdom.
A man having no frdom cannot b concivd of xcpt as dprivd of
lif.
If th concption of frdom appars to rason to b a snslss
contradiction lik th possibility of prforming two actions at on and
th sam instant of tim, or of an ffct without a caus, that only
provs that consciousnss is not subjct to rason.
This unshakabl, irrfutabl consciousnss of frdom, uncontrolld by
xprimnt or argumnt, rcognizd by all thinkrs and flt by vryon
without xcption, this consciousnss without which no concption of man
is possibl constituts th othr sid of th qustion.
Man is th cration of an all-powrful, all-good, and all-sing God.
What is sin, th concption of which ariss from th consciousnss of
man’s frdom? That is a qustion for thology.
Th actions of mn ar subjct to gnral immutabl laws xprssd in
statistics. What is man’s rsponsibility to socity, th concption of
which rsults from th concption of frdom? That is a qustion for
jurisprudnc.
Man’s actions procd from his innat charactr and th motivs acting
upon him. What is conscinc and th prcption of right and wrong
in actions that follows from th consciousnss of frdom? That is a
qustion for thics.
Man in connction with th gnral lif of humanity appars subjct
to laws which dtrmin that lif. But th sam man apart from that
connction appars to b fr. How should th past lif of nations and
of humanity b rgardd—as th rsult of th fr, or as th rsult of
th constraind, activity of man? That is a qustion for history.
Only in our slf-confidnt day of th popularization of knowldg—thanks
to that most powrful ngin of ignoranc, th diffusion of printd
mattr—has th qustion of th frdom of will bn put on a lvl on
which th qustion itslf cannot xist. In our tim th majority of
so-calld advancd popl—that is, th crowd of ignoramuss—hav takn
th work of th naturalists who dal with on sid of th qustion for a
solution of th whol problm.
Thy say and writ and print that th soul and frdom do not xist,
for th lif of man is xprssd by muscular movmnts and muscular
movmnts ar conditiond by th activity of th nrvs; th soul and
fr will do not xist bcaus at an unknown priod of tim w sprang
from th aps. Thy say this, not at all suspcting that thousands of
yars ago that sam law of ncssity which with such ardor thy ar now
trying to prov by physiology and comparativ zoology was not mrly
acknowldgd by all th rligions and all th thinkrs, but has nvr
bn dnid. Thy do not s that th rol of th natural scincs in
this mattr is mrly to srv as an instrumnt for th illumination
of on sid of it. For th fact that, from th point of viw of
obsrvation, rason and th will ar mrly scrtions of th brain, and
that man following th gnral law may hav dvlopd from lowr animals
at som unknown priod of tim, only xplains from a frsh sid
th truth admittd thousands of yars ago by all th rligious and
philosophic thoris—that from th point of viw of rason man is
subjct to th law of ncssity; but it dos not advanc by a hair’s
bradth th solution of th qustion, which has anothr, opposit, sid,
basd on th consciousnss of frdom.
If mn dscndd from th aps at an unknown priod of tim, that is
as comprhnsibl as that thy wr mad from a handful of arth at a
crtain priod of tim (in th first cas th unknown quantity is th
tim, in th scond cas it is th origin); and th qustion of how
man’s consciousnss of frdom is to b rconcild with th law of
ncssity to which h is subjct cannot b solvd by comparativ
physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ap, w can
obsrv only th muscular nrvous activity, but in man w obsrv
consciousnss as wll as th muscular and nrvous activity.
Th naturalists and thir followrs, thinking thy can solv this
qustion, ar lik plastrrs st to plastr on sid of th walls of
a church who, availing thmslvs of th absnc of th chif
suprintndnt of th work, should in an accss of zal plastr ovr th
windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttrssd walls, and should b
dlightd that from thir point of viw as plastrrs, vrything is now
so smooth and rgular.
CHAPTR IX
For th solution of th qustion of fr will or invitability, history
has this advantag ovr othr branchs of knowldg in which th
qustion is dalt with, that for history this qustion dos not rfr
to th ssnc of man’s fr will but its manifstation in th past and
undr crtain conditions.
In rgard to this qustion, history stands to th othr scincs as
xprimntal scinc stands to abstract scinc.
Th subjct for history is not man’s will itslf but our prsntation of
it.
And so for history, th insolubl mystry prsntd by th
incompatibility of fr will and invitability dos not xist as it dos
for thology, thics, and philosophy. History survys a prsntation of
man’s lif in which th union of ths two contradictions has alrady
takn plac.
In actual lif ach historic vnt, ach human action, is vry clarly
and dfinitly undrstood without any sns of contradiction, although
ach vnt prsnts itslf as partly fr and partly compulsory.
To solv th qustion of how frdom and ncssity ar combind and
what constituts th ssnc of ths two concptions, th philosophy
of history can and should follow a path contrary to that takn by othr
scincs. Instad of first dfining th concptions of frdom and
invitability in thmslvs, and thn ranging th phnomna of lif
undr thos dfinitions, history should dduc a dfinition of th
concption of frdom and invitability thmslvs from th immns
quantity of phnomna of which it is cognizant and that always appar
dpndnt on ths two lmnts.
Whatvr prsntation of th activity of many mn or of an individual
w may considr, w always rgard it as th rsult partly of man’s fr
will and partly of th law of invitability.
Whthr w spak of th migration of th popls and th incursions
of th barbarians, or of th dcrs of Napolon III, or of somon’s
action an hour ago in choosing on dirction out of svral for his
walk, w ar unconscious of any contradiction. Th dgr of frdom and
invitability govrning th actions of ths popl is clarly dfind
for us.
Our concption of th dgr of frdom oftn varis according to
diffrncs in th point of viw from which w rgard th vnt, but
vry human action appars to us as a crtain combination of frdom and
invitability. In vry action w xamin w s a crtain masur of
frdom and a crtain masur of invitability. And always th mor
frdom w s in any action th lss invitability do w prciv, and
th mor invitability th lss frdom.
Th proportion of frdom to invitability dcrass and incrass
according to th point of viw from which th action is rgardd, but
thir rlation is always on of invrs proportion.
A sinking man who clutchs at anothr and drowns him; or a hungry mothr
xhaustd by fding hr baby, who stals som food; or a man traind
to disciplin who on duty at th word of command kills a dfnslss
man—sm lss guilty, that is, lss fr and mor subjct to th law of
ncssity, to on who knows th circumstancs in which ths popl wr
placd, and mor fr to on who dos not know that th man was himslf
drowning, that th mothr was hungry, that th soldir was in th ranks,
and so on. Similarly a man who committd a murdr twnty yars ago and
has sinc livd pacably and harmlssly in socity sms lss guilty
and his action mor du to th law of invitability, to somon who
considrs his action aftr twnty yars hav lapsd than to on who
xamind it th day aftr it was committd. And in th sam way vry
action of an insan, intoxicatd, or highly xcitd man appars lss
fr and mor invitabl to on who knows th mntal condition of him
who committd th action, and sms mor fr and lss invitabl to on
who dos not know it. In all ths cass th concption of frdom
is incrasd or diminishd and th concption of compulsion is
corrspondingly dcrasd or incrasd, according to th point of viw
from which th action is rgardd. So that th gratr th concption of
ncssity th smallr th concption of frdom and vic vrsa.
Rligion, th common sns of mankind, th scinc of jurisprudnc,
and history itslf undrstand alik this rlation btwn ncssity and
frdom.
All cass without xcption in which our concption of frdom and
ncssity is incrasd and diminishd dpnd on thr considrations:
(1) Th rlation to th xtrnal world of th man who commits th dds.
(2) His rlation to tim.
(3) His rlation to th causs lading to th action.
Th first considration is th clarnss of our prcption of th man’s
rlation to th xtrnal world and th gratr or lssr clarnss
of our undrstanding of th dfinit position occupid by th man
in rlation to vrything coxisting with him. This is what maks it
vidnt that a drowning man is lss fr and mor subjct to ncssity
than on standing on dry ground, and that maks th actions of a man
closly connctd with othrs in a thickly populatd district, or of on
bound by family, official, or businss dutis, sm crtainly lss fr
and mor subjct to ncssity than thos of a man living in solitud and
sclusion.
If w considr a man alon, apart from his rlation to vrything around
him, ach action of his sms to us fr. But if w s his rlation
to anything around him, if w s his connction with anything
whatvr—with a man who spaks to him, a book h rads, th work on
which h is ngagd, vn with th air h braths or th light that
falls on th things about him—w s that ach of ths circumstancs
has an influnc on him and controls at last som sid of his activity.
And th mor w prciv of ths influncs th mor our concption of
his frdom diminishs and th mor our concption of th ncssity that
wighs on him incrass.
Th scond considration is th mor or lss vidnt tim rlation of
th man to th world and th clarnss of our prcption of th plac
th man’s action occupis in tim. That is th ground which maks th
fall of th first man, rsulting in th production of th human rac,
appar vidntly lss fr than a man’s ntry into marriag today. It is
th rason why th lif and activity of popl who livd cnturis ago
and ar connctd with m in tim cannot sm to m as fr as th lif
of a contmporary, th consquncs of which ar still unknown to m.
Th dgr of our concption of frdom or invitability dpnds in this
rspct on th gratr or lssr laps of tim btwn th prformanc
of th action and our judgmnt of it.
If I xamin an act I prformd a momnt ago in approximatly th sam
circumstancs as thos I am in now, my action appars to m undoubtdly
fr. But if I xamin an act prformd a month ago, thn bing in
diffrnt circumstancs, I cannot hlp rcognizing that if that act had
not bn committd much that rsultd from it—good, agrabl, and vn
ssntial—would not hav takn plac. If I rflct on an action still
mor rmot, tn yars ago or mor, thn th consquncs of my action
ar still plainr to m and I find it hard to imagin what would hav
happnd had that action not bn prformd. Th farthr I go back
in mmory, or what is th sam thing th farthr I go forward in my
judgmnt, th mor doubtful bcoms my blif in th frdom of my
action.
In history w find a vry similar progrss of conviction concrning
th part playd by fr will in th gnral affairs of humanity. A
contmporary vnt sms to us to b indubitably th doing of all th
known participants, but with a mor rmot vnt w alrady s its
invitabl rsults which prvnt our considring anything ls possibl.
And th farthr w go back in xamining vnts th lss arbitrary do
thy appar.
Th Austro-Prussian war appars to us undoubtdly th rsult of th
crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. Th Napolonic wars still sm
to us, though alrady qustionably, to b th outcom of thir hros’
will. But in th Crusads w alrady s an vnt occupying its dfinit
plac in history and without which w cannot imagin th modrn history
of urop, though to th chroniclrs of th Crusads that vnt appard
as mrly du to th will of crtain popl. In rgard to th migration
of th popls it dos not ntr anyon’s had today to suppos that
th rnovation of th uropan world dpndd on Attila’s capric. Th
farthr back in history th objct of our obsrvation lis, th mor
doubtful dos th fr will of thos concrnd in th vnt bcom and
th mor manifst th law of invitability.
Th third considration is th dgr to which w apprhnd that
ndlss chain of causation invitably dmandd by rason, in which ach
phnomnon comprhndd, and thrfor man’s vry action, must hav
its dfinit plac as a rsult of what has gon bfor and as a caus of
what will follow.
Th bttr w ar acquaintd with th physiological, psychological, and
historical laws dducd by obsrvation and by which man is controlld,
and th mor corrctly w prciv th physiological, psychological,
and historical causs of th action, and th simplr th action w ar
obsrving and th lss complx th charactr and mind of th man in
qustion, th mor subjct to invitability and th lss fr do our
actions and thos of othrs appar.
Whn w do not at all undrstand th caus of an action, whthr a
crim, a good action, or vn on that is simply nonmoral, w ascrib a
gratr amount of frdom to it. In th cas of a crim w most urgntly
dmand th punishmnt for such an act; in th cas of a virtuous act w
rat its mrit most highly. In an indiffrnt cas w rcogniz in it
mor individuality, originality, and indpndnc. But if vn on of
th innumrabl causs of th act is known to us w rcogniz a crtain
lmnt of ncssity and ar lss insistnt on punishmnt for th crim,
or th acknowldgmnt of th mrit of th virtuous act, or th frdom
of th apparntly original action. That a criminal was rard among mal
factors mitigats his fault in our ys. Th slf-sacrific of a fathr
or mothr, or slf-sacrific with th possibility of a rward, is mor
comprhnsibl than gratuitous slf-sacrific, and thrfor sms lss
dsrving of sympathy and lss th rsult of fr will. Th foundr of a
sct or party, or an invntor, imprsss us lss whn w know how or by
what th way was prpard for his activity. If w hav a larg rang
of xampls, if our obsrvation is constantly dirctd to sking th
corrlation of caus and ffct in popl’s actions, thir actions
appar to us mor undr compulsion and lss fr th mor corrctly w
connct th ffcts with th causs. If w xamind simpl actions and
had a vast numbr of such actions undr obsrvation, our concption of
thir invitability would b still gratr. Th dishonst conduct of th
son of a dishonst fathr, th misconduct of a woman who had falln
into bad company, a drunkard’s rlaps into drunknnss, and so on ar
actions that sm to us lss fr th bttr w undrstand thir caus.
If th man whos actions w ar considring is on a vry low stag of
mntal dvlopmnt, lik a child, a madman, or a simplton—thn,
knowing th causs of th act and th simplicity of th charactr and
intllignc in qustion, w s so larg an lmnt of ncssity and so
littl fr will that as soon as w know th caus prompting th action
w can fortll th rsult.
On ths thr considrations alon is basd th concption of
irrsponsibility for crims and th xtnuating circumstancs admittd
by all lgislativ cods. Th rsponsibility appars gratr or lss
according to our gratr or lssr knowldg of th circumstancs in
which th man was placd whos action is bing judgd, and according
to th gratr or lssr intrval of tim btwn th commission of th
action and its invstigation, and according to th gratr or lssr
undrstanding of th causs that ld to th action.
CHAPTR X
Thus our concption of fr will and invitability gradually diminishs
or incrass according to th gratr or lssr connction with th
xtrnal world, th gratr or lssr rmotnss of tim, and th
gratr or lssr dpndnc on th causs in rlation to which w
contmplat a man’s lif.
So that if w xamin th cas of a man whos connction with th
xtrnal world is wll known, whr th tim btwn th action and
its xamination is grat, and whr th causs of th action ar most
accssibl, w gt th concption of a maximum of invitability and a
minimum of fr will. If w xamin a man littl dpndnt on xtrnal
conditions, whos action was prformd vry rcntly, and th causs of
whos action ar byond our kn, w gt th concption of a minimum of
invitability and a maximum of frdom.
In nithr cas—howvr w may chang our point of viw, howvr plain
w may mak to ourslvs th connction btwn th man and th xtrnal
world, howvr inaccssibl it may b to us, howvr long or short th
priod of tim, howvr intlligibl or incomprhnsibl th causs
of th action may b—can w vr conciv ithr complt frdom or
complt ncssity.
(1) To whatvr dgr w may imagin a man to b xmpt from th
influnc of th xtrnal world, w nvr gt a concption of frdom
in spac. vry human action is invitably conditiond by what surrounds
him and by his own body. I lift my arm and lt it fall. My action sms
to m fr; but asking myslf whthr I could rais my arm in vry
dirction, I s that I raisd it in th dirction in which thr was
last obstruction to that action ithr from things around m or from
th construction of my own body. I chos on out of all th possibl
dirctions bcaus in it thr wr fwst obstacls. For my action
to b fr it was ncssary that it should ncountr no obstacls. To
conciv of a man bing fr w must imagin him outsid spac, which is
vidntly impossibl.
(2) Howvr much w approximat th tim of judgmnt to th tim of th
dd, w nvr gt a concption of frdom in tim. For if I xamin
an action committd a scond ago I must still rcogniz it as not
bing fr, for it is irrvocably linkd to th momnt at which it was
committd. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myslf: could I hav
abstaind from lifting my arm at th momnt that has alrady passd? To
convinc myslf of this I do not lift it th nxt momnt. But I am
not now abstaining from doing so at th first momnt whn I askd th
qustion. Tim has gon by which I could not dtain, th arm I thn
liftd is no longr th sam as th arm I now rfrain from lifting,
nor is th air in which I liftd it th sam that now surrounds m. Th
momnt in which th first movmnt was mad is irrvocabl, and at that
momnt I could mak only on movmnt, and whatvr movmnt I mad
would b th only on. That I did not lift my arm a momnt latr dos
not prov that I could hav abstaind from lifting it thn. And sinc I
could mak only on movmnt at that singl momnt of tim, it could not
hav bn any othr. To imagin it as fr, it is ncssary to imagin
it in th prsnt, on th boundary btwn th past and th futur—that
is, outsid tim, which is impossibl.
(3) Howvr much th difficulty of undrstanding th causs may b
incrasd, w nvr rach a concption of complt frdom, that is,
an absnc of caus. Howvr inaccssibl to us may b th caus of th
xprssion of will in any action, our own or anothr’s, th first dmand
of rason is th assumption of and sarch for a caus, for without a
caus no phnomnon is concivabl. I rais my arm to prform an action
indpndntly of any caus, but my wish to prform an action without a
caus is th caus of my action.
But vn if—imagining a man quit xmpt from all influncs, xamining
only his momntary action in th prsnt, unvokd by any caus—w wr
to admit so infinitly small a rmaindr of invitability as quald
zro, w should vn thn not hav arrivd at th concption of complt
frdom in man, for a bing uninfluncd by th xtrnal world, standing
outsid of tim and indpndnt of caus, is no longr a man.
In th sam way w can nvr imagin th action of a man quit dvoid of
frdom and ntirly subjct to th law of invitability.
(1) Howvr w may incras our knowldg of th conditions of spac
in which man is situatd, that knowldg can nvr b complt, for th
numbr of thos conditions is as infinit as th infinity of spac. And
thrfor so long as not all th conditions influncing mn ar dfind,
thr is no complt invitability but a crtain masur of frdom
rmains.
(2) Howvr w may prolong th priod of tim btwn th action w ar
xamining and th judgmnt upon it, that priod will b finit, whil
tim is infinit, and so in this rspct too thr can nvr b absolut
invitability.
(3) Howvr accssibl may b th chain of causation of any action, w
shall nvr know th whol chain sinc it is ndlss, and so again w
nvr rach absolut invitability.
But bsids this, vn if, admitting th rmaining minimum of frdom to
qual zro, w assumd in som givn cas—as for instanc in that of a
dying man, an unborn bab, or an idiot—complt absnc of frdom, by
so doing w should dstroy th vry concption of man in th cas w ar
xamining, for as soon as thr is no frdom thr is also no man. And
so th concption of th action of a man subjct solly to th law of
invitability without any lmnt of frdom is just as impossibl as
th concption of a man’s compltly fr action.
And so to imagin th action of a man ntirly subjct to th law of
invitability without any frdom, w must assum th knowldg of an
infinit numbr of spac rlations, an infinitly long priod of tim,
and an infinit sris of causs.
To imagin a man prfctly fr and not subjct to th law of
invitability, w must imagin him all alon, byond spac, byond tim,
and fr from dpndnc on caus.
In th first cas, if invitability wr possibl without frdom
w should hav rachd a dfinition of invitability by th laws of
invitability itslf, that is, a mr form without contnt.
In th scond cas, if frdom wr possibl without invitability w
should hav arrivd at unconditiond frdom byond spac, tim, and
caus, which by th fact of its bing unconditiond and unlimitd would
b nothing, or mr contnt without form.
W should in fact hav rachd thos two fundamntals of which man’s
whol outlook on th univrs is constructd—th incomprhnsibl
ssnc of lif, and th laws dfining that ssnc.
Rason says: (1) spac with all th forms of mattr that giv it
visibility is infinit, and cannot b imagind othrwis. (2) Tim is
infinit motion without a momnt of rst and is unthinkabl othrwis.
(3) Th connction btwn caus and ffct has no bginning and can
hav no nd.
Consciousnss says: (1) I alon am, and all that xists is but m,
consquntly I includ spac. (2) I masur flowing tim by th fixd
momnt of th prsnt in which alon I am conscious of myslf as living,
consquntly I am outsid tim. (3) I am byond caus, for I fl myslf
to b th caus of vry manifstation of my lif.
Rason givs xprssion to th laws of invitability. Consciousnss
givs xprssion to th ssnc of frdom.
Frdom not limitd by anything is th ssnc of lif, in man’s
consciousnss. Invitability without contnt is man’s rason in its
thr forms.
Frdom is th thing xamind. Invitability is what xamins. Frdom
is th contnt. Invitability is th form.
Only by sparating th two sourcs of cognition, rlatd to on anothr
as form to contnt, do w gt th mutually xclusiv and sparatly
incomprhnsibl concptions of frdom and invitability.
Only by uniting thm do w gt a clar concption of man’s lif.
Apart from ths two concpts which in thir union mutually dfin on
anothr as form and contnt, no concption of lif is possibl.
All that w know of th lif of man is mrly a crtain rlation of fr
will to invitability, that is, of consciousnss to th laws of rason.
All that w know of th xtrnal world of natur is only a crtain
rlation of th forcs of natur to invitability, or of th ssnc of
lif to th laws of rason.
Th grat natural forcs li outsid us and w ar not conscious of
thm; w call thos forcs gravitation, inrtia, lctricity, animal
forc, and so on, but w ar conscious of th forc of lif in man and
w call that frdom.
But just as th forc of gravitation, incomprhnsibl in itslf but
flt by vry man, is undrstood by us only to th xtnt to which w
know th laws of invitability to which it is subjct (from th first
knowldg that all bodis hav wight, up to Nwton’s law), so too th
forc of fr will, incomprhnsibl in itslf but of which vryon is
conscious, is intlligibl to us only in as far as w know th laws of
invitability to which it is subjct (from th fact that vry man dis,
up to th knowldg of th most complx conomic and historic laws).
All knowldg is mrly a bringing of this ssnc of lif undr th
laws of rason.
Man’s fr will diffrs from vry othr forc in that man is dirctly
conscious of it, but in th ys of rason it in no way diffrs from
any othr forc. Th forcs of gravitation, lctricity, or chmical
affinity ar only distinguishd from on anothr in that thy ar
diffrntly dfind by rason. Just so th forc of man’s fr will
is distinguishd by rason from th othr forcs of natur only by th
dfinition rason givs it. Frdom, apart from ncssity, that is,
apart from th laws of rason that dfin it, diffrs in no way from
gravitation, or hat, or th forc that maks things grow; for rason,
it is only a momntary undfinabl snsation of lif.
And as th undfinabl ssnc of th forc moving th havnly bodis,
th undfinabl ssnc of th forcs of hat and lctricity, or
of chmical affinity, or of th vital forc, forms th contnt of
astronomy, physics, chmistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in th
sam way dos th forc of fr will form th contnt of history.
But just as th subjct of vry scinc is th manifstation of this
unknown ssnc of lif whil that ssnc itslf can only b th
subjct of mtaphysics, vn th manifstation of th forc of fr will
in human bings in spac, in tim, and in dpndnc on caus forms
th subjct of history, whil fr will itslf is th subjct of
mtaphysics.
In th xprimntal scincs what w know w call th laws of
invitability, what is unknown to us w call vital forc. Vital forc is
only an xprssion for th unknown rmaindr ovr and abov what w know
of th ssnc of lif.
So also in history what is known to us w call laws of invitability,
what is unknown w call fr will. Fr will is for history only an
xprssion for th unknown rmaindr of what w know about th laws of
human lif.
CHAPTR XI
History xamins th manifstations of man’s fr will in connction
with th xtrnal world in tim and in dpndnc on caus, that is, it
dfins this frdom by th laws of rason, and so history is a scinc
only in so far as this fr will is dfind by thos laws.
Th rcognition of man’s fr will as somthing capabl of influncing
historical vnts, that is, as not subjct to laws, is th sam for
history as th rcognition of a fr forc moving th havnly bodis
would b for astronomy.
That assumption would dstroy th possibility of th xistnc of laws,
that is, of any scinc whatvr. If thr is vn a singl body
moving frly, thn th laws of Kplr and Nwton ar ngativd and no
concption of th movmnt of th havnly bodis any longr xists. If
any singl action is du to fr will, thn not a singl historical law
can xist, nor any concption of historical vnts.
For history, lins xist of th movmnt of human wills, on nd
of which is hiddn in th unknown but at th othr nd of which a
consciousnss of man’s will in th prsnt movs in spac, tim, and
dpndnc on caus.
Th mor this fild of motion sprads out bfor our ys, th mor
vidnt ar th laws of that movmnt. To discovr and dfin thos laws
is th problm of history.
From th standpoint from which th scinc of history now rgards its
subjct on th path it now follows, sking th causs of vnts in
man’s fr will, a scintific nunciation of thos laws is impossibl,
for howvr man’s fr will may b rstrictd, as soon as w rcogniz
it as a forc not subjct to law, th xistnc of law bcoms
impossibl.
Only by rducing this lmnt of fr will to th infinitsimal, that
is, by rgarding it as an infinitly small quantity, can w convinc
ourslvs of th absolut inaccssibility of th causs, and thn
instad of sking causs, history will tak th discovry of laws as
its problm.
Th sarch for ths laws has long bn bgun and th nw mthods of
thought which history must adopt ar bing workd out simultanously
with th slf-dstruction toward which—vr disscting and disscting
th causs of phnomna—th old mthod of history is moving.
All human scincs hav travld along that path. Arriving at
infinitsimals, mathmatics, th most xact of scincs, abandons th
procss of analysis and ntrs on th nw procss of th intgration
of unknown, infinitly small, quantitis. Abandoning th concption
of caus, mathmatics sks law, that is, th proprty common to all
unknown, infinitly small, lmnts.
In anothr form but along th sam path of rflction th othr scincs
hav procdd. Whn Nwton nunciatd th law of gravity h did not say
that th sun or th arth had a proprty of attraction; h said that all
bodis from th largst to th smallst hav th proprty of attracting
on anothr, that is, laving asid th qustion of th caus of th
movmnt of th bodis, h xprssd th proprty common to all bodis
from th infinitly larg to th infinitly small. Th sam is don by
th natural scincs: laving asid th qustion of caus, thy sk for
laws. History stands on th sam path. And if history has for its objct
th study of th movmnt of th nations and of humanity and not th
narration of pisods in th livs of individuals, it too, stting
asid th concption of caus, should sk th laws common to all th
insparably intrconnctd infinitsimal lmnts of fr will.
CHAPTR XII
From th tim th law of Coprnicus was discovrd and provd, th mr
rcognition of th fact that it was not th sun but th arth that movs
sufficd to dstroy th whol cosmography of th ancints. By disproving
that law it might hav bn possibl to rtain th old concption of
th movmnts of th bodis, but without disproving it, it would sm
impossibl to continu studying th Ptolmaic worlds. But vn aftr
th discovry of th law of Coprnicus th Ptolmaic worlds wr still
studid for a long tim.
From th tim th first prson said and provd that th numbr of births
or of crims is subjct to mathmatical laws, and that this or that
mod of govrnmnt is dtrmind by crtain gographical and conomic
conditions, and that crtain rlations of population to soil produc
migrations of popls, th foundations on which history had bn built
wr dstroyd in thir ssnc.
By rfuting ths nw laws th formr viw of history might hav bn
rtaind; but without rfuting thm it would sm impossibl to continu
studying historic vnts as th rsults of man’s fr will. For if a
crtain mod of govrnmnt was stablishd or crtain migrations
of popls took plac in consqunc of such and such gographic,
thnographic, or conomic conditions, thn th fr will of thos
individuals who appar to us to hav stablishd that mod of govrnmnt
or occasiond th migrations can no longr b rgardd as th caus.
And yt th formr history continus to b studid sid by sid with th
laws of statistics, gography, political conomy, comparativ philology,
and gology, which dirctly contradict its assumptions.
Th struggl btwn th old viws and th nw was long and stubbornly
fought out in physical philosophy. Thology stood on guard for th
old viws and accusd th nw of violating rvlation. But whn truth
conqurd, thology stablishd itslf just as firmly on th nw
foundation.
Just as prolongd and stubborn is th struggl now procding btwn
th old and th nw concption of history, and thology in th sam way
stands on guard for th old viw, and accuss th nw viw of subvrting
rvlation.
In th on cas as in th othr, on both sids th struggl provoks
passion and stifls truth. On th on hand thr is far and rgrt for
th loss of th whol dific constructd through th ags, on th othr
is th passion for dstruction.
To th mn who fought against th rising truths of physical philosophy,
it smd that if thy admittd that truth it would dstroy faith in
God, in th cration of th firmamnt, and in th miracl of Joshua th
son of Nun. To th dfndrs of th laws of Coprnicus and Nwton, to
Voltair for xampl, it smd that th laws of astronomy dstroyd
rligion, and h utilizd th law of gravitation as a wapon against
rligion.
Just so it now sms as if w hav only to admit th law of
invitability, to dstroy th concption of th soul, of good and vil,
and all th institutions of stat and church that hav bn built up on
thos concptions.
So too, lik Voltair in his tim, uninvitd dfndrs of th law of
invitability today us that law as a wapon against rligion, though
th law of invitability in history, lik th law of Coprnicus in
astronomy, far from dstroying, vn strngthns th foundation on which
th institutions of stat and church ar rctd.
As in th qustion of astronomy thn, so in th qustion of history
now, th whol diffrnc of opinion is basd on th rcognition or
nonrcognition of somthing absolut, srving as th masur of visibl
phnomna. In astronomy it was th immovability of th arth, in history
it is th indpndnc of prsonality—fr will.
As with astronomy th difficulty of rcognizing th motion of th arth
lay in abandoning th immdiat snsation of th arth’s fixity and of
th motion of th plants, so in history th difficulty of rcognizing
th subjction of prsonality to th laws of spac, tim, and caus
lis in rnouncing th dirct fling of th indpndnc of on’s own
prsonality. But as in astronomy th nw viw said: “It is tru that w
do not fl th movmnt of th arth, but by admitting its immobility
w arriv at absurdity, whil by admitting its motion (which w do not
fl) w arriv at laws,” so also in history th nw viw says: “It is
tru that w ar not conscious of our dpndnc, but by admitting our
fr will w arriv at absurdity, whil by admitting our dpndnc on
th xtrnal world, on tim, and on caus, w arriv at laws.”
In th first cas it was ncssary to rnounc th consciousnss of an
unral immobility in spac and to rcogniz a motion w did not fl;
in th prsnt cas it is similarly ncssary to rnounc a frdom
that dos not xist, and to rcogniz a dpndnc of which w ar not
conscious.
